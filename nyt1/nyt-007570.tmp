The expansion Nashville Predators, who begin play next season
and will raid each of the existing 26 NHL teams by taking at least
one player from every club in Friday's expansion draft, pick third
overall. They are followed, in order, by Vancouver, Anaheim,
Calgary and the New York Rangers. Toronto, the New York Islanders
and Chicago round out the top 10.
Carolina picks 11th, Colorado 12th with the first of four
first-round picks, and Edmonton is 13th. Then, it's up to the
Coyotes, who lost their first-round pick last year in the Jeremy
Roenick trade with the Blackhawks. Phoenix's first pick last year
was second-rounder Juha Gustafsson, a defenseman from Finland.
Although this year's draft class isn't seen as very deep after
the first handful of picks, Phoenix should find itself a solid
prospect at No. 14 to fit any one of its four or five major needs:
a goal-scoring left winger to eventually complement Keith Tkachuk;
a speedy top-line right wing who can finish; a capable goalie who
can fill a backup role within two to three years; and both an
offensive and defensive defenseman.
Fata, who scored 43 goals and 76 points, might fall to them at
that spot. But if 6-2, 195-pound left wing Ramzi Abid is still on
the board, he might be too hard to pass up. Rated as the 11th-best
prospect by Central Scouting, he led the Quebec league in scoring
with 50 goals, 85 assists and 135 points in 68 games. He also
posted Tkachuk-like numbers in the penalty box 266 minutes in
all.
Abid is Tunisian by descent but was born in Montreal. The only
thing that scares some scouts away from him is his skating, which
has been ranked at a five on a scale to 10. Tkachuk's wheels
wouldn't rate much better, but it's the overall game that counts
most. And remember, Abid's a left winger, too.
Czech defenseman Jiri Fischer (6-5{, 210) might be tough for the
Coyotes to pass up if he's still available. Ditto with 6-3 Ottawa
center Mark Bell, who scored 34 goals and has been compared to a
young Bobby Smith by his juniors coach, Brian Kilrea, who also
coached Smith, it should be noted.
The top goalie prospect is Patrick DesRochers, a 6-3{,
195-pounder who went 26-17-11 with a respectable 3.35 goals-against
average for Sarnia in the Ontario league.
ST. LOUIS If batting practice is becoming a distraction to
Mark McGwire, what will happen if he's sitting at 55 home runs with
a full month remaining in the season?
Of course, not everyone who plays this game gets the same
reception. In today's game, McGwire is an unrivaled home- run
hitter. The very best in his field and quite possibly the best
ever.
He has hit a home run every 11.54 at-bats, better than anyone in
the history of the game, including Babe Ruth, who is next at 11.76.
