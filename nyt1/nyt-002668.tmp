The head bullies were Scottie Pippen, Toni Kukoc and Dennis
Rodman. They were part of a defensive and offensive effort by the
Bulls that was so aggressive, the Jazz players were punch drunk by
the end of the first half. The Jazz appeared too stunned and too
timid to retaliate.
Instead of countering with toughness, the Jazz settled for
passive jumpers, rushed its plays and fell right into the hands of
a Bulls team that was driving to the basket and pressuring the
ball. The combo resulted in a runaway game that began in the second
quarter. In a horrible span of the period, the Jazz turned the ball
over nine times and fell behind by 18 points before the half.
To build that gaudy lead, Pippen became omnipresent as he cut
off every passing lane and flew into the face of any guard who
dared to drive to the basket.
To keep Karl Malone from countering to keep his team close,
Rodman began irritating what had been a hot Malone.
He began sticking Malone in the back, and needling him into
frustration. After Malone hit his first six shots, the bulk of
which were over Luc Longley, Rodman came and turned things around.
Malone took just one more shot in the first half, and was much
more ineffective the rest of the game.
Kukoc also factored into the Bulls' ambush. He continually found
his way to the loose balls, beating players bigger and bulkier in
wrestling away rebounds.
It was not as if the Jazz players did not realize they faced a
team capable of outmuscling them. The Jazz entered this game in
search of some aggression after a pedestrian effort in Game 2, when
it was outrebounded on the offensive boards 18-9.
Sloan was irate in Game 2. He was watching the Bulls be the
aggressors, seeing them drive for baskets and barge in when they
missed a shot.
Steve Kerr was a perfect example. He missed his 3-pointer, but
bolted ahead of John Stockton and underneath Malone to pull away
the rebound. Kerr then whipped a pass to Jordan, who completed a
3-point play that gave the Bulls a lead they would never relinquish
with 47 seconds left in Game 2.
