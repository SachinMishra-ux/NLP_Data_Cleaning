And Compaq Computer is even trying to turn its products into
portals by installing several buttons on its computer keyboards
that direct users to certain Web sites.
Analysts said that all these moves represent the massing of
forces for what will shape up to be a long and brutal war over
which two or three portal services will become dominant.
With the stakes in the online world far lower a few years ago,
America Online spent a $1 billion on television advertising and
distribution of sign-up disks to surge past its rivals, Prodigy and
Compuserve.
WASHINGTON In an unusually sharp rebuke of his party leader,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Thursday urged Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott to allow a vote on the nomination of James Hormel as
ambassador to Luxembourg.
The nomination of Hormel, a Democratic contributor from San
Francisco who is heir to the meat-packing fortune, was approved by
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on a 16-to-2 vote last fall.
But Lott, at the request of a small group of conservative senators,
has refused to move the nomination to the floor.
D'Amato, who has supported gay rights in the past, is running
for a fourth term this year and is seeking endorsements from gay
groups. His letter comes four days after Lott said in a television
interview that he considered homosexuality a sin.
Feinstein said she believed that more than 60 senators support
Hormel, enough votes to overcome any effort to block the nomination
through a filibuster if it reaches the floor.
Officials with one of the groups that D'Amato is courting, Human
Rights Campaign, praised D'Amato's letter and said that he was very
much in the running for their endorsement.
Ms. Stachelberg said D'Amato had opposed efforts to deny federal
financing to organizations that serve homosexuals, and had been a
supporter of homosexuals serving in the military and a sponsor of
legislation to prohibit job discrimination against gay men and
lesbians.
But officials with a New York gay rights group, Empire State
Pride Agenda, criticized D'Amato on Thursday for not doing enough
to pressure the Republicans who control the New York state Senate
to allow a floor vote on legislation that would prohibit
discrimination against homosexuals. The bill was still locked in
committee Thursday as the Legislature neared the end of this year's
session.
