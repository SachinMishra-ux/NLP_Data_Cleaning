WASHINGTON As legislation to overhaul the nation's schools
moves toward final approval in Congress, President Clinton and the
Republican majority on Capitol Hill remain far apart on a key
issue, frozen in the ice of uncompromising positions.
In this showdown, the president's veto pen will temporarily win,
and should. But a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision has
energized the opposition and suggests that the stalemate could be
as permanently damaging as that over abortion rights.
Although the two sides have many philosophical and practical
differences over education, the most contentious question is that
of taxpayer-funded vouchers to encourage children of low-income
families to attend private secular or religious schools.
Proposed tax-free savings accounts of up to $2,000 a year for
school expenses for families of all incomes, including tuition at
parochial schools, are a variation on the same theme.
The GOP devotion to the concept of subsidizing parents to flee
the public schools is matched in fervor only by the president's
conviction that such a shift would undermine the free public school
system he rightly considers a fundamental bulwark of democracy. It
would divert limited public resources in an always-tight federal
budget.
On Thursday the House approved an education bill that includes
provisions to pay for tax-free savings accounts and vouchers,
deliberately defying the president's threat to veto the entire bill
if they are included. The Senate is due to vote on the measure
soon.
Another recent measure provided for vouchers specifically for
low-income families in the District of Columbia. Clinton vetoed it,
as promised.
