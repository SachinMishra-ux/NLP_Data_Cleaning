In Northern California, where Kaiser provides HMO coverage to
roughly 2.7 million people, or 1 of every 3 insured residents,
Viagra has never made its way onto the list of reimbursed
medications.
She said excluding Viagra is inconsistent with policies that pay
for such things as seasonal allergy medications that also improve
quality of life, even if they don't treat life-threatening
conditions.
Patients and advocates specializing in erectile dysfunction
roundly condemned Kaiser's decision, calling it a misguided slap
against those who want erection problems treated as a disease
rather than a joke.
Shapiro said taking the pill helped him regain not only full
sexual function but also helped him fight bouts of depression.
Betsy Imholz, senior attorney for Consumers Union in San
Francisco, noted that Kaiser will pay for office treatments and
surgery for erection problems.
But some top medical experts took Kaiser's side, maintaining
that all HMO members should not have to bear the cost of the sexual
activities of a few men.
SAN FRANCISCO Some leading brands of home water filtration
systems, bought by tens of thousands of health-conscious consumers,
actually increase the amount of lead in drinking water, according
to a study released Thursday.
The study, commissioned by a San Francisco environmental group,
found that two common brands of water filters raised lead levels to
three times the federal standard and to more than 60 or 70 times a
more stringent state level.
Four other brands were found to have lead levels above the state
standard. In all, the six brands represent as much as 50 percent of
the $2.5 billion market for water filtration systems, the group
said.
In response to the study, one manufacturer, Franke Inc., said it
was withdrawing one of its product lines from the market and
offered to refund consumers the price of any recent purchases.
