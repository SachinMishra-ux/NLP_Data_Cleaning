Soccer officials cannot very well ban the English team from
major tournaments, although it was a stroke of luck having them
fail to qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
There are other candidates for 2006 Germany, South Africa,
Australia. I say it's too soon to give the World Cup back to
Europe, and South Africa could be unstable after the Mandela era.
Australia is a good alternative, and the yobs could not just hop a
ferry or a train and be at the World Cup in a few hours.
Do I really think a yellow card would stop the marauders? No,
not really. But a red card would make the 2006 World Cup safer from
these thugs, to allow the Brazilians and the Moroccans and all the
other joyous fans to link arms and dance in the streets, the way
they do on Copacabana Beach in Nantes.
Ms. Holmes, the Soviet-trained artistic director of the Boston
Ballet, had danced the pas de deux and was drawn to the three-act
work after seeing a videotape of Konstantin Sergeyev's 1992
production for the Bolshoi Ballet. The Sergeyev staging was itself
inspired by versions by Marius Petipa, whose ballets helped define
ballet classicism in Russia, in the late 19th century.
Ms. Holmes acquired the sets and costumes from another Soviet
production, by Yuri Grigorovich, which she found stored in a
warehouse in Moscow.
To help with the production, she brought Vadim Disnitsky,
Sergeyev's assistant, to Boston, along with Natalya Dudinskaya, Ms.
Holmes' longtime mentor, a noted Soviet ballerina and the wife of
Sergeyev. Other Soviet dancers already in Boston Tatiana Legat,
Tatiana Terekhova and Sergei Berejnoi helped with the staging.
Irina Kolpakova, a former Kirov Ballet star currently coaching
Ballet Theater dancers, helped with the Soviet style, which
emphasizes the line of the upper body more than American ballet
training does.
But Ms. Holmes' first step in the restaging was to work with
company music directors on the score, which is by five composers.
Then came considerable editing and reassigning of dances and
dramatic bits to make the plot more plausible.
Including the anecdote in a catalog statement about his art,
Slick sees the fast, funny cheeseburger zinger as the kind of
equalizer used by Indians to arm themselves against the put-downs
of white America.
In fact, the strongest theme of the show is the clash of
American Indian values with those of the contemporary world specifically the white world and the way Indians deal with being,
so to speak, low men on the totem pole in a country they still see
as a bastion of colonialism.
