NEW ORLEANS Maurice Greene felt he was ready to break the
world record for the 100-meter dash. His coaches said he was ready.
His opponents said he was ready.
Saturday night, the world champion gets a big chance. The
occasion is right the U.S. outdoor track and field championships.
The heat and humidity provides good sprinting weather because his
muscles can get loose. The opposition is expected to include such
world-class sprinters as Dennis Mitchell, Tim Montgomery and Brian
Lewis.
And Greene, like many other Americans, was not enamored with the
frequent breast-beating of Donovan Bailey, the Canadian who set the
record of 9.84 seconds in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
Friday night, the 23-year-old Greene moved toward his goal. In
the quarterfinals, he ran impressively and won in 9.84 seconds,
helped by a following wind too strong to allow record recognition.
In the semifinals 2 hours 20 minutes later, although he did not
look overly sharp, he still won cleanly in 9.96 seconds.
Very good, according to two victims in that race. One was
30-year-old Kevin Little, a high-level sprinter for a decade. The
other was 19-year-old Ja'Warren Hooker, a Washington freshman and
one of America's sprint proteges.
At least Little knew what to expect. Hooker, who had never run
against Greene before, faced him in the quarterfinals and
semifinals.
Friday night's winners included John Godina in the men's discus
throw (220 feet 1 inch), Marc Davis in the men's 5,000 meters (13
minutes 40.62 seconds) and Lynn Jennings in the women's 10,000
meters (34:09.86). For the 37-year-old Jennings, it was the seventh
title in 12 years in this event and her 38th national title
overall. 
Victor Romagna, an outspoken force in America's Cup yacht racing
for a quarter of a century, died June 12 at his home in Annapolis,
Md. He was 80.
Romagna sailed on the crew of three successful America's Cup
defense teams: the 12-Meter Columbia in 1958, Weatherly in 1962 and
Intrepid in 1967.
A sailboat efficiency expert, Romagna was instrumental in
rearranging the layout of Intrepid for the 1967 cup races. The
yacht's winches were moved below deck to reduce clutter, and the
cockpit was moved forward to improve viewing.
