KOSOVO-NATO (Washington) On Kosovo, there is much NATO
hand-wringing about what to do, but little stomach for sending in
troops. Restored sanctions aimed at Serbia are likely. By Steven
Erlanger.
KOREA-U.S. (Seoul) Kim Dae-jung, the former dissident and who
is now president of South Korea, returns to the United States on
Saturday, to a much better reception. By Nicolas D. Kristof.
IRAQ-U.N. (United Nations) Iraq's foreign minister holds a
news conference to comment on the two days of briefings by arms
inspectors. By Barbara Crossette.
ECON-REPORT (Undated) The economy added more jobs than
expected in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent. Payrolls expanded by 296,000 people
last month, exceeding forecasts of a gain of about 220,000. April's
employment gain was revised upward to 302,000 from the initial
estimate of 262,000. By Sylvia Nasar.
INTERNET-U.S. (Undated) Ira Magaziner will announce the White
House's new proposal for overhauling the Internet's naming and
address system. The proposal will refine a plan announced earlier
this year to turn over management of the system to the private
sector and stimulate competition for registering new Internet
addresses. By Amy Harmon.
NEUTRINO-FUNDS (Takayama, Japan) As Japanese and American
scientists basked in the glow of their monumental discovery of
neutrino mass announced here on Friday, a financial cloud hung over
the 120-member team one that could hamstring future research. By
Malcolm Browne.
SEX-CONVERSATION (Undated) In corporate conference rooms, in
dentists' chairs, and over dinner, the continuing news about both
Viagra and Monica Lewinsky appears to have accelerated a change in
the way many Americans speak about a subject that some would prefer
be barely spoken about at all. In recent months, the subject of sex
and the language of sex acts and sex organs have been nudged a few
inches closer to the conversationally commonplace. By Janny Scott.
WAR-CENTENNIAL (Undated) Centennials usually call for a lot of
clanking celebration, a period souvenir or two and perhaps some
minor historical revisionism. The 1898 observation, now under way
in Spain, Cuba, the Philippines and the United States, is a tough
one. So much was set in motion that it is difficult to contemplate
how we got from there to here. By Timothy Egan.
BOX-FIGHT-CANCELED (New York) Evander Holyfield's heavyweight
title fight against Henry Akinwande appears to be off after
Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B. This follows a female
fighter being disqualified because she was pregnant. If the card
goes off at all, Roberto Duran, the 47-year-old Panamanian, will be
the headliner. It all amounts to boxing's comedy of errors in a
sports facility that pledged to get back into the business.
An anti-terrorism consortium formed in 1978, it is such a
far-reaching, massive association that in 20 years, the Vigipirate
has felt the need to go into action only three times.
