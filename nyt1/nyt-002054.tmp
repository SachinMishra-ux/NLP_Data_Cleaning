Understanding a fund's exposure to liquidity risk, however, is
quite another matter. Liquidity risk is the possibility that the
price of a stock will drop, and therefore may push down the fund's
net asset value, when a manager tries to sell a large position. Or
that the price will climb, forcing a manager to pay too much when
buying a large chunk.
Unless investors have examined a fund's holdings in each stock
and compared them with the total shares outstanding in the company,
it is tough to fathom such risk for a particular fund.
Although it is not much of a concern in large-cap stock funds,
liquidity risk can wreak real havoc in micro-cap funds, which
invest in fledgling companies with market values of $250 million or
less. Positions in such companies are much harder to get in and out
of without roiling the market.
How damaging can illiquid stocks be to a portfolio? Plenty, as
shareholders in two Dreyfus small-cap stock funds, Premier
Aggressive Growth A, with $264 million in assets, and Aggressive
Growth, at $77 million, are finding out.
Indeed, these two funds are textbook examples of the perils of
illiquidity. So far this year, through Thursday, shareholders in
Premier Aggressive Growth have lost 13.5 percent; those in
Aggressive Growth are down 18 percent. As a benchmark, the Wilshire
Small-Cap index is up 10.8 percent. Last year, Premier Aggressive
Growth was down 13 percent; Aggressive Growth lost almost 16
percent.
Performance like this may explain the April news that the funds'
manager since August 1995, Michael L. Schonberg, was being joined
by Paul A. LaRocco, late of Founders Asset Management in Denver,
who was named the primary manager. Mellon Bank Corp. owns both the
Founders and Dreyfus fund companies.
For the two and a half years that Schonberg ran the fund alone,
he bought speculative technology or biotechnology companies with
few shares outstanding. He even borrowed money to buy shares.
How illiquid are some of the holdings? Frighteningly so.
According to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, the
median market capitalization of the larger of the two funds,
Premier Aggressive Growth, is a Lilliputian $157 million. Across
the micro-cap fund category, only 20 percent of funds have a median
market capitalization this small or smaller.
The median market cap of Aggressive Growth is even smaller, at
$87 million. Only 10 percent of micro-cap funds in Morningstar's
universe have median market values that tiny.
More than 10 percent of Premier Aggressive Growth's assets are
in stocks that trade at $5 a share or less. In the Aggressive
Growth fund, 20 percent fall in that range.
