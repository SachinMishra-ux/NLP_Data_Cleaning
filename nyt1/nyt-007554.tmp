This is not to imply that the Special Olympics are any kind of
somber experience. Au contraire. The Massachusetts Special
Olympics, which are being held this weekend at MIT, happens to be
one of the great uplifting experiences anyone can have. I mean, if
it's smiling faces you want to see, the Special Olympics is the
place to see them.
It's a variation of the famed Grantland Rice idea that the
important thing is how you played the game. In this case, the
important thing is that you played the game. For many of the
athletes, participation truly is enough to make them happy.
You can meet some extraordinary people. Take Michael McAdams,
for example. He has been participating in Special Olympic
competitions since 1987. He was there to run in both the 100 meters
and 400 meters Saturday, but during his time he has earned medals
in basketball, soccer, volleyball, the long jump, and shot put.
When most of us think of the Special Olympics, we tend to
conjure up a picture of people running, jumping, or throwing an
object. Track and field is the glamour sport of the event, no
doubt. But there is a lot more going on right now than track and
field.
I got to see most of a doubles match. Dan Widrich and Rich
Miller prevailed over David Broden and Meg Schilling in a match
that included some nice rallies and some particularly agile
retrieves by Miller, a Special Olympics veteran who admitted to
being a somewhat reluctant participant since he considers himself
more of a coach than an athlete these days.
The tennis players are particularly excited because four of them
will be nominated to participate in the 1999 World Games, which
will be held next summer in North Carolina. But most of the
participants don't need that carrot in order to enjoy themselves
here.
With that, the skies opened up a bit and it seemed to make sense
to get in out of the rain. That took me inside the hockey rink, and
into the roller skating competition.
And speaking of smiles, Peter Richards had a grin as wide as a
football field every time he passed in front of his family when he
skated around the floor. He was pretty psyched when he got his
silver medal, too.
Vicki Movsessian was on hand to give out medals, and if the name
sounds familiar, it's because she was a member of the gold
medal-winning women's hockey team in Nagano.
I know this much: There is no way you can put a price tag on one
of those smiles.
