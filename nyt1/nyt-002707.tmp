No promises. No promises that the 31-year-old Ramos would get a
spot on the 22-man roster. And now that he's here, living with his
fellow Yanks in an ivy-covered castle in the middle of Beaujolais
country, there's no guarantee that Ramos will start when the
Americans take on Germany in Paris a week from Monday.
Ramos's spot used to be in the middle of the intersection,
dribbling and distributing. But that was before he tore his ACL in
a Cup qualifier at Trinidad two Novembers ago, then did it again
last fall.
Now Claudio Reyna, who went to Ramos's old high school (St.
Benedict's Prep in Newark), has taken over at playmaker and Sampson
isn't sure he can start two men who aren't used to sharing one
ball.
It's not as if there aren't enough midfield jobs to go around.
There are six of them in Sampson's 3-6-1 formation, and if Ramos
can't be the playmaker, he'll find something else to be. Reyna
won't be tripping over Ramos's feet or his ego.
Ramos has been wearing a US jersey since he played in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul. He's one of three players left from the 1990 Cup
team and second only to Cobi Jones among capped midfielders. He
knows how to adjust to whatever circumstance throws at him.
The only thing Ramos couldn't adjust to was getting hurt. He was
at the top of his game two years ago when he shredded his knee the
first time. Coincidence or not, the Americans then went 2-2-4 in
Cup qualifiers without him after being 3-0-0 with him.
When Ramos came back, he scored the team's best goal of the year
to beat Costa Rica, 1-0. Six weeks later, he ruined the knee again
and doctors told him he might not make it back for the Cup.
Ramos wishes he had a couple more months to get ready. He wishes
he had the luxury of making a few mistakes in friendly matches. He
wishes he hadn't been moved back to GO with so little time to prove
himself again.
Zubov was released from custody Sunday and police issued a brief
statement. When asked if Zubov had been arraigned, a police
dispatcher said the department could not comment further than what
was contained in the statement.
The statement said officers were called to the 1000 block of
Gibbs Crossing at 3:05 a.m. Sunday in reference to a 911 hangup.
