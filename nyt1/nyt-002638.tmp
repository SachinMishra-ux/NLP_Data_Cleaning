But, she said, on May 14 the same day the department's letter
went out to the researchers the attorney general's office called
to say that the report was only a draft and to withdraw permission
to talk to the researchers.
Ms. Tencza said there were no political machinations involved:
Discussions of the methodology had gone on since the report was
filed, she said, and the May 14 letter only reflected continuing
discussions. And she said that the lawyer for the attorney
general's office who gave out the report was simply unaware that it
was a draft.
The letter specifically questioned the researchers' use of
trends in abortion and birth rates to estimate what those rates
might have been without the welfare changes, and the suggestion
that the welfare changes may have caused the difference. And it
said that the researchers need not redo the study, but should
submit a revised version in three weeks, making clear the
difficulties of determining causality.
Michael Camasso, the lead researcher on the $1 million
evaluation project, declined to discuss the specifics of the
December report or the re-working now under way.
The December report is not the first part of the family-cap
research to have its release delayed. In an interim report,
completed in 1996, the same Rutgers team found that while birth
rates among New Jersey welfare recipients had declined by more than
20 percent since the family cap law went into effect, the decline
was the same among those who forfeited extra benefits as among a
control group of women who were allowed to keep extra benefits for
their newborns. That report was released more than a year later,
only when the lawyers challenging the policy obtained it from the
federal government under a Freedom of Information Act request.
NEW YORK In an ambitious and controversial effort to increase
the number of welfare recipients participating in New York City's
workfare program, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani will soon begin requiring
physically and mentally disabled mothers to work for their welfare
checks.
The new policy began quietly this weekend when city officials
ordered about 800 disabled women to report to welfare offices for
screening into the new 20-hour-a-week workfare program.
The women, who showed up at city offices clutching plastic pill
bottles and crumpled medical forms on Saturday, had already been
examined by city doctors who classified them as permanently or
temporarily unemployable since they suffer from chronic seizures,
mental illness, severe arthritis and other ailments.
But under the new rules, the mothers will be required to work in
jobs tailored to their specific impairments by nonprofit groups
accustomed to working with the disabled, including Goodwill
Industries of Greater New York. Women who cannot walk, for
instance, might type or stuff envelopes. Only those women with
disabilities severe enough to qualify for federal disability
benefits will be exempt.
City officials say the old system, which allowed the disabled to
stay home until city doctors certified that they could work, denied
job training, work experience and career counseling to people who
desperately needed those services.
