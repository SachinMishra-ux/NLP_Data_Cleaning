PORTAGE, Ind. Three people were killed and five others injured
Thursday morning when a Chicago-bound commuter train struck a
tractor-trailer truck that had been stuck at a crossing.
According to investigators, the truck, which was delivering
three 40,000-pound steel coils, had crossed the commuter tracks as
it entered a steel mill in Portage, 30 miles southeast of Chicago.
However, a freight train running on tracks parallel to the South
Shore Railroad train had tripped its crossing gates and trapped the
tail end of the double-wide truck between the two tracks.
While it was stopped at the crossing waiting for the freight
train to clear, authorities said, the commuter train approached and
slammed into the overlapping trailer, dragging it close to 400
feet. The impact launched one of the steel coils into the front car
of the train, killing three of the passengers, William McCombs of
Laporte, Ind., Gary Berndt of Michigan City, ind., and Glenn Walker
of Baroda, Mich., an off-duty employee of the railroad. The five
other passengers received minor injuries. The truck driver was not
seriously hurt.
The two-car train, which originated in Michigan City, Ind., was
the first of 10 morning trains carrying people to Chicago. The
collision occurred at 4:35 a.m., stopping service on the line that
shuttles between South Bend, Ind., and Chicago.
According to Dave Eggers, a trooper with the Indiana State
Police, the driver of the truck, Keith Lintz of Niles, Mich., was
cited for several violations. The most serious of the citations was
an overweight violation, since Lintz did not have the proper permit
required to carry such a heavy load.
Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board were
on the scene leading the investigation. Michael Martino, the
investigator in charge, said they planned to recreate the crash
Saturday, by which time they would have a better idea of what
happened.
(Train passengers were also injured in two other collisions
Thursday. In Durham, N.C., an Amtrak train heading for New York
with about 200 on board hit a tractor-trailer at a downtown
crossing, critically injuring the truck driver and slightly
injuring two in the train crew. The 18-wheel tractor-trailer
wrapped around the front of the locomotive and briefly caught fire.
The locomotive derailed, though it remained upright.
In Boston, two subway trains collided at one of the city's
busiest stations during lunch hour. Transportation officials say at
least 10 people were hurt, but none of the injuries were
life-threatening. One Green Line train slammed into the back of
another at the Government Center station, witnesses said.)
In 1993, two South Shore trains collided in Gary, Ind., killing
seven and injuring more than 60. In that accident, federal
authorities said, an engineer had disregarded a signal to stop.
