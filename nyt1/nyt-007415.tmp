When the team qualified for the World Cup in December, thousands
of women forced their way into the 100,000 seat male-only stadium
to honor the team. People danced in the street and soccer started
to mean change.
President Clinton has taped a goodwill message with the hope it
will be viewed on TV by Iranians during the game and a Swiss
referee has been chosen to make sure things are neutral.
Symptomatic of the country's identity crisis, Iranians have been
flipping channels between the World Cup action and the dramatic
broadcasts of the popular, reformist, mayor of Tehran. He is
defending himself against religious conservatives who have put him
on trial.
Even today is not just saved for soccer. Sunday is a work day
here and the hard-line Iranian parliament is holding an impeachment
hearing for one of Khatami's most important cabinet members.
Saturday's newspapers focused on that battle as well as the game
against the U.S., but it was clear that the soccer team is
identified with reform.
WASHINGTON The Senate is poised to try yet again in July to
enact legislation that has been around in one form or another for
more than a decade a bill setting nationwide standards to limit
damage awards to people harmed by faulty products as diverse as
heart valves and tractors.
Although its supporters have come tantalizingly close on several
occasions only to see legislative agreements fall to pieces at the
last moment, they are unusually optimistic this time around. The
main reason is that there is now apparent agreement among the
principals: the White House; Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, the
chief Republican spokesman on the issue, and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., who has made product liability almost a personal crusade.
In fact, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has told senators and
reporters that he now believes the measure has sufficient support
and that he expects to bring it to the floor for a vote around July
14. The principal obstacle to the legislation has always been in
the Senate, and not the House, supporters of the bill agree.
The issue pits an array of business interests who favor limits
on court-approved damage awards against a coalition of consumer
groups and trial lawyers and their influential trade organization.
The nation's largest manufacturers have said that the bill to be
voted on next month does not go far enough and that they will
oppose it.
Whether to regulate damages in court cases is among the most
complex and often abstract of issues. How should the United States
structure its civil litigation system to achieve maximum fairness
and accessibility?
