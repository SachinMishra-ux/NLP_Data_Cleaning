Anyway, back to your husband being a loon. He's probably blowing
smoke about keeping track of your extracurricular typing. Maybe if
he's got way too much time on his hands, he's actually figured out
a way to make you think he knows all and sees all. For instance, if
you chat on Yahoo! or any other place where you use your browser,
the chat site not only shows up in your history folder, there's a
good chance some of the pages are in the browser cache. All you
have to do is dump your temporary Internet files to get rid of the
evidence.
Or, maybe you're using some sort of a chat program that can log
your conversations, and your paranoid little hubby has switched
that feature on and forgotten to tell you about it. Could be he's
truly insane and has some sort of program running on your computer
that records all your keystrokes and commands. The problem is not
whether it's possible for him to do it, it's that he feels like he
has to do it at all, or at least intimidate you into feeling like
he can.
Now, if anybody out there knows a way that people can actually
track your chats the way this guy claims to, please let me know and
I'll pass it along. Nobody should be able to get away with that.
Besides, I'd hate it if my recipe for Hot Jell-O Surprise got out.

ATLANTA There's something a little silly about turning to your
PC for advice about exercise. After all, if you didn't spend so
danged much time sitting at the keyboard, cruising the Web and
sending e-mail, you'd get outside more.
But since the PC and the Internet are facts of life now, you
might as well use some of the resources of the World Wide Web to
find ways to get in shape.
.tyrell.net/(tilde)fitness/ and zap on over to World Fitness
Online. This is a good place to start, because you'll probably
agree with the philosophy here. The notion, according to this page,
is:
The practical nature of this page also extends to the sort of
features you'll find. If you want to get in shape without spending
a lot of money, you'll be able to follow the directions here for
constructing some of your own exercise equipment, including a
wooden stair device. It isn't as fancy as the step machines you'll
find in the gym, but you won't need to spend your hard-earned money
to get one. And, since you'll build the wooden stepper yourself,
you'll get your first exercise just from constructing it.
Then, as you'd expect, there are sections that offer exercise
advice, as well as a forum where you can leave questions for the
exercise experts who hang around this site.
/fitnesspartner/. You already know that exercise alone isn't
enough for good personal fitness, so the emphasis of this site on
diet and eating the right foods will fit right in with your fitness
plan.
