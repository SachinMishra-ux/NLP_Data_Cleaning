Russell got to relax a little after Karros' first-inning homer
off Jamey Wright (5-7) gave the Dodgers a 3-0 lead. In a season
weighed down by an ailing left knee, Karros had his second five-RBI
game. He has 19 RBI in his other 45 games.
With Bobby Bonilla, Eric Young and Raul Mondesi all out with
injuries, Karros' effort was critical. But it was Mlicki's
performance that might have been even more important.
Before the game, Ramon Martinez arrived in Denver after
receiving a third opinion on his injured right shoulder. Noted
orthopedist William Andrews saw what the others saw torn
cartilage and rotator cuff that likely will require season-ending
surgery.
While Martinez considers his future, Mlicki has been the only
Dodgers starter to step up. In his last two starts, Mlicki,
acquired from the New York Mets in the Hideo Nomo deal, has allowed
one run in 17 innings.
Against the Rockies, he allowed just two runners to reach base
and got 15 ground-ball outs. Unlike Wednesday, when Roger Cedeno's
error cost the Dodgers in the 12th, the club played great defense
behind Mlicki.
Paul Konerko, starting at third for Bonilla, made a diving stop
of Dante Bichette's fourth-inning liner that looked even more
important when Vinny Castilla followed with a double to the gap in
right-center.
Mlicki (3-4) got double plays in the first after Neifi Perez
opened with a single and in the ninth after Todd Helton opened with
a single.
And before Karros blew open the game with a two-run double in
the eighth, Mlicki worked out of a jam in the seventh.
With runners at first and second and two out, Perez came to the
plate representing the tying run. He lifted a fly ball to deep
right. Gary Sheffield retreated to the warning track to make the
catch.
It didn't work in New York, where Mlicki was the fifth starter
and bumped several times in the rotation because of rainouts.
