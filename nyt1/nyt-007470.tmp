Highwoods and Nichols struck a deal in which Highwoods would pay
$65 cash, shares of Highwoods stock, or a combination of cash and
stock for each share of Nichols stock. Shareholders may elect to
receive up to 100 percent of Highwoods stock. However, the total
transaction may comprise only 40 percent cash.
Exercising appraisal rights, also known as dissenter rights,
gives shareholders who oppose a merger a chance to get a higher
cash price for the stock after negotiations or an independent
appraisal. Blackacre said that could force some Nichols
shareholders who want cash for their Nichols stock to accept
Highwoods stock instead.
Nichols countered that 29 percent of shareholders already had
said they wanted all Highwoods stock. That leaves at least 45
percent cash for each of the remaining shareholders, in the event
Blackacre exercises appraisal rights.
To make the transaction more tax-friendly, Blackacre proposed
that the employee stock ownership trust buy up to 15 percent of the
outstanding shares from longtime Nichols shareholders. Blackacre
also suggested that the employee stock trust, which owns about 31
percent of Nichols, would remain an owner of 15 percent of the
company.
Nichols said that type of transaction would require Internal
Revenue Service approval, which was not guaranteed and which could
take months to get.
At a time when big one-design yachts and all the class rules
that come with them are dominating sailboat racing, a 26-footer
with an independent pedigree is competing as the little boat that
could.
The boat is a favorite to win the sport-boat division at Block
Island Race Week again when event begins on Monday on Rhode Island
Sound with 133 sailboats expected over all. One of the most
competitive classes will be among the 14 sport boats all from
production classes trying to unseat the free-spirited Wai Rere
(pronounced Why-REAR-ee). The craft has no class rules other than
to go fast.
The boat's New Zealand designer, Steve Thompson, has built only
the one boat. Formerly named Tom Tom Taxi, the boat was in New
Zealand when the Bouzaids took it for a sail. By the end of the
day, the couple had bought the boat for $25,000, a good buy. Most
sport boats the modern 25-to-35-foot open-cockpit racers cost
more like $50,000 to $80,000.
Wai Rere has a oversized ballast bulb at the end of its fin
keel, and a circular, bowl-shaped hull that likes to heel rather
than stay flat in a breeze. The way the Bouzaids see it, that makes
the boat easier to sail than its contemporaries.
The closest thing to it in competition today is the Viper 830GR,
a larger and more expensive version of Wai Rere. Also a Thompson
creation, the sailboat is built in Tiverton, R.I., as a production
model with its own set of class rules. Two Viper 830's are expected
at Block Island, and both have names that indicate a challenge to
the Bouzaids' flying fish: one is High Voltage, and the other,
Snakebite.
