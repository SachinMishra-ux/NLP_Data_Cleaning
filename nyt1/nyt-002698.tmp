 'Twas fitting that the last game Kahn was allowed to do as the
radio voice of USC sports was a baseball game that ended up with a
football score....
 Fearing a Sports I!llustrated piece in the works will only
further besmirch Garrett's reputation, USC has sent out a
preemptive strike. Senior VP Dennis Dougherty's office dashed off a
multi-page memo to certain SC alums, explaining how some higher-ups
have been interviewed for this probably slanted story by Don Yeager
(publishing date unknown). They also issued a statement signed by
school prez Steven Sample and other esteemed colleagues pledging
full support for Garrett....
ANAHEIM Dante Bichette's fly ball to medium left field had the
fans at Edison Field streaming for the exits, if they hadn't left
already.
Trailing by two runs, the Colorado Rockies were down to their
last out, and Anaheim Angels left fielder Darin Erstad pounded his
glove in anticipation of the club's eighth consecutive victory. The
problem was, Erstad never saw the ball in the twilight sky. It
landed untouched and two baserunners scored on the play to tie the
game at 5.
Bizarre? Not as bizarre as the bottom of the ninth inning, when
the Angels managed to pull out a 6-5 victory Sunday before 42,493
at Edison Field.
The Angels won the game in the bottom of the ninth when Jim
Edmonds scored from third on a wild pitch that got past
shortstop-turned-catcher Neifi Perez. Perez was forced into playing
catcher after the Rockies pinch-hit for starter Kirt Manwaring in
the top of the ninth, and backup catcher Jeff Reed got knocked out
of the game in a home-plate collision with Dave Hollins earlier in
the bottom of the ninth.
Hollins opened the bottom of the ninth with a walk off Jerry
Dipoto, and Edmonds followed with a liner into the right-center
field gap. Third base coach Larry Bowa waved home Hollins, who
initiated a nasty collision with Reed. Reed held on to the ball but
had a bad cut on his right cheek.
Baylor has two emergency catchers Jason Bates and Greg
Colbrunn but both had already played in the game and were taken
out. Baylor decided to move Perez to catcher because he has good
hands. Perez said he had caught when he was 13, about 10 years ago.
Dipoto walked Tim Salmon intentionally to bring up Cecil
Fielder. On a 1-1 count, Dipoto threw a slider in the dirt and it
got away from Perez, allowing Edmonds to score the game-winner.
The win was the Angels' eighth in a row, their longest winning
streak since a 10-game streak July 5-17 last season. The victory
also moved the Angels (34-26) to within 2{ games of first-place
Texas in the AL West, the closest they've been since May 8 when
they were two games out. But this was most certainly the strangest
in the streak.
