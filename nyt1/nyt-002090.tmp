WASHINGTON Despite President Clinton's opposition to
physician-assisted suicide, the federal government will not stand
in the way of doctors who help terminally ill patients in Oregon
kill themselves, Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday.
Reno concluded after a nearly seven-month review that the
federal anti-drug statute does not bar doctors from prescribing
lethal medication for dying patients, as allowed under Oregon's
unique physician-assisted suicide law. Oregon's 1994 Death with
Dignity Act, which state voters upheld in a referendum last
November, permits doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to
patients expected to live only six more months.
Two doctors must share the dire prognosis and agree that the
patient is mentally competent to ask for medical assistance in
committing suicide. Doctors, while allowed to prescribe lethal
medications, are prohibited under the law from giving deadly
injections.
At least three terminally ill patients in Oregon have committed
suicide with the help of a doctor since the law went into effect
Oct. 27. The Oregon Medical Association, prior to the department's
announcement, cautioned doctors in the state that prescribing
lethal doses might result in the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration revoking their licenses to prescribe medicine.
Reno, in refusing to hinder the Oregon law, rejected the
position of DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine, who in November
said physicians prescribing lethal doses would be in violation of
the federal Controlled Substances Act and would run the risk of
losing their prescription licenses.
The Oregon statute, enacted by referendum in 1994, survived a
challenge from opponents when state voters last November rejected
by a 3-2 margin a ballot initiative to repeal the law.
The Supreme Court last June ruled that terminally ill patients
do not have a constitutional right to have a doctor help them kill
themselves. But the justices, in upholding laws barring
physician-assisted suicide, said states may enact laws permitting
the controversial practice.
NEW YORK Mary Donohue, former prosecutor and judge, casts
herself as a compassionate and loyal sidekick, a lieutenant
governor who is willing to follow, not lead.
The former teacher who rose from being the head of Rensselaer
County's Junior League, to being elected district attorney and then
a state Supreme Court judge, resigned last week from the bench
after being tapped by Gov. George Pataki and GOP Chairman Bill
Powers to run for lieutenant governor.
In nominating Donohue, delegates seized upon her longtime
loyalty to the GOP, a trait party loyalists claim is lacking in the
current lieutenant governor Betsy McCaughey Ross, who also was
hand-picked by Pataki in 1994 and is now trying to bump him out of
office as a Democrat.
