Kenneth Fisher, a city councilman from Brooklyn, who helped
identify Douglas' body at the funeral home last week, said Douglas
apparently had not worked at all in the last two years and died in
poverty. He said the mourners at Douglas' funeral a variety of
politicians, political consultants and reporters took up a
collection to help pay for the funeral.
Fisher, who said Douglas had been living with a girlfriend named
Alice in Brighton Beach, said Douglas made up the name Zachary
Phillips because he wanted to live in anonymity. But other
acquaintances at the funeral said they believed that although the
name was purely concocted, Phillips was his real last name.
Douglas ran Fisher's first campaign for City Council in 1991. He
coordinated hundreds of volunteers for Mayor Edward Koch's 1981
re-election campaign and Mayor David Dinkins' campaign in 1989. He
also helped run Vice President Al Gore's 1988 bid for the
Democratic presidential nomination. He advised dozens of
congressional, judicial and City Council campaigns into the early
1990s.
But people in political circles had started to question his
credibility as early as 1981.
NEW YORK A young woman whose body was found floating in the
East River 14 years ago is believed to have been killed by a couple
who were angered when she refused to work for them as a prostitute,
police said Saturday.
The couple, Arthur and Donna Kinlaw, were charged on Friday with
the murder of the woman, who was never identified, police said. Lt.
Steven Boldis, commanding officer of the Bronx Cold Case Squad,
said the Kinlaws ran a prostitution ring in the Hunts Point section
of the Bronx until fleeing New York more than a decade ago, when he
said they set out on a life of robbery, prostitution, burglary,
forgery and welfare fraud that spanned seven states. They were
arrested while in jail in El Centro, Calif., where they were
serving an eight-month sentence for welfare fraud, Boldis said.
The woman was discovered in the East River off Hunts Point on
May 3, 1984. Police said that when she was pulled from the water,
the short, black-haired woman was wearing a ripped blouse and blue
jeans, and appeared to have been bludgeoned and suffocated. Her
hands had been tied behind her back with scraps from her blouse,
and other sections were found stuffed down her throat, said Sgt.
Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman.
There were few clues, and the case was soon closed. But in
April, welfare fraud investigators in California told investigators
in New York that a woman whose name was being used as an alias by
Mrs. Kinslaw said she had information about a murder, police said.
The informer said that the dead woman's first name was Linda,
that she was likely of Italian-American origin and may have lived
with her grandmother in either Brentwood or Bay Shore on Long
Island, police said. Detectives narrowed down the possible victims
to the body found in the East River in 1984.
With that statement and other evidence later gleaned by
detectives, the police concluded that Kinlaw, 46, and his
39-year-old wife met the woman at a club called Blackberry Jam in
Bay Shore sometime in 1984. There, the Kinlaws, who have nine
children from their 20-year marriage, apparently befriended the
woman and then tried to convince her to become a prostitute in the
Hunts Point area, police said. They added that the couple had been
known in the area as running a prostitution ring at the time.
