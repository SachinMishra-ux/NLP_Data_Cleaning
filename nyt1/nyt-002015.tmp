Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
But it's worth it financially enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
DaMota said his listing began as a parody of another site, but
he soon began getting requests from women who wanted him to include
them on his pages.
For many amateurs who want to show off, the Internet is a kind
of safe underground where they can do so without being seen by the
mainstream including their relatives, friends and neighbors.
Tobi became an online sensation, with Usenet regulars clamoring
for more. The couple set up a Web site earlier this year, charging
visitors $14.95 a month.
But then, a boyfriend of Tobi's cousin spotted her pictures on
Usenet. Her cousin then told the rest of Tobi's family, who accused
F1guru of taking advantage of her.
Hubby and Wifey keep their Internet activities away from their
children. And Wifey worries that her religious parents will find
out. If that happens, she said, her days of flaunting it on the Net
will likely be over.
