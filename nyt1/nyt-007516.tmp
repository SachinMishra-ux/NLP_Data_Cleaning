Sunday's match, the first ever between the US and Iran, is being
touted as a bit of political serendipity, bringing two together
countries that have had no diplomatic relations for nearly two
decades.
After 20 years away from soccer's global stage, the Iranians are
delighted merely to be here. Iran was Asia's dominant team in the
'70s, winning three continental championships and qualifying for
the 1976 Olympics and the 1978 World Cup. Then the revolution and
the Iraq war brought soccer in Iran to a halt.
Talebi settled his family in San Jose, opened a supermarket and
took a coaching job at De Anza community college. While the Islamic
government back home railed against the Great Satan, Talebi felt
welcome as an Iranian in the States.
For Talebi, the serendipity is not that his country is playing
America but that his country is playing in the Cup at all.
The Iranians are here by a near-miracle. They did not win their
qualifying group last year. They could not beat Japan in the Asian
playoff. They could not beat Australia at home in the first match
of their last-chance playoff and trailed, 2-0, with 14 minutes left
in the return match at Melbourne. Somehow, the Iranians pulled off
a draw and got a ticket to France because they had scored more road
goals.
Whatever happens inside the Stade Gerland Sunday, the Iranians
plan to shake hands with the Americans after the final whistle and
exchange jerseys.
Much of the international noise over the match hasn't reached
the players. The Iranian team has been secluded in a bakery school
in Yssingeaux, a 90-minute drive southwest of the city. The
American team is quartered in an ivy-covered chateau in the wine
country an hour's drive north.
The players know each other by reputation and by jersey number.
They're vaguely aware of the recent diplomatic dance steps between
their governments. But for most of them, what happened in 1979 is
hazy history.
Some 20 years later, 22 men from the United States and Iran will
march onto a small patch of grass in France, many of them hardly
able to remember the details of the 1979 international crisis.
They will arrive to an entirely different corner of the world, a
snug little French city called Lyon, which is known for tempting
wines and quaint sidewalk cafes.
