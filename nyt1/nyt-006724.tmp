Among the blue-chip brands that have recently sponsored one or
more ads that in some fashion tested the limits of acceptability
are Altoids, Elizabeth Arden, Audi, Bass, Budweiser, Casio,
Columbia Sportswear, Grey Poupon, Gucci, Kraft, MM/Mars, Miller
Lite, Nike and Toyota.
Does that mean that the bold and brassy or the vulgar and
tasteless style of advertising is already going out of style?
Yes, and no.
There is a watercolor, painted with her happy blues and reds and
a touch of leaf green (in her work, one often finds leaf green),
that the artist Nelly Toll made as an 8-year-old child in wartime
Poland. It depicts a little girl with a red ribbon in her hair
brushing her big, docile shepherd dog in a large wash basin, while
her mother prepares food in their enormous kitchen.
In reality, Ms. Toll and her mother, in 1943, had no home. Ms.
Toll's younger brother had been one of the first Polish Jews to be
sent to Auschwitz. Her father was in the ghetto, where he would
die. Ms. Toll and her mother spent much of the war hiding from the
Nazis in the two-room apartment of a gentile couple. When there
were visitors, mother and daughter hid in a space so narrow they
had to stand sideways. As for dogs, Ms. Toll had a terror of them.
Ms. Toll has master's degrees in counseling, art therapy and art
history. She slips into the jargon and makes a second getaway.
Where does the trick come from that enables one to do a reverse
print of reality, throwing up pretty watercolors in yellows and
reds when you are living in the colors of genocide and war?
Ms. Toll painted 64 watercolors in the 13 months she and her
mother were in hiding. (Six will be auctioned at Sotheby's next
Friday.) All show scenes of a happy childhood.
Ms. Toll, who favors dangling earrings and has an accent
evocative of borscht, is a welcoming, exuberant sort.
Her ability to convert scenes of war to scenes of seeming
normalcy, Ms. Toll believes, was the gift of her mother, Rose.
After the war, Ms. Toll's mother remarried and had another
daughter. The family came to the United States in 1951. Today, Ms.
Toll seems to inhabit the world she painted as a child: leaf-green,
happy domesticity. Married, with two children and five
grandchildren, Ms. Toll lives in a suburb of generous green lawns.
She is an adjunct professor of creative writing. She also lectures
on Holocaust art.
