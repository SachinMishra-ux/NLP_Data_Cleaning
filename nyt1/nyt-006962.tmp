The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
No I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on my modern
social developments.
That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.

WATER-FILTERS (San Francisco) Home water filters intended to
remove chemicals and other impurities may be leaching lead into
glasses of water. A sampling of 16 under-the-sink filters found
that nine contained brass parts that leached lead at levels above
those considered safe under California's tough anti-toxics law. By

BATTERED-GAYS (San Francisco) San Francisco would be the first
city in the nation to fund shelter beds for gay men who are
battered by their partners, if Supervisor Mark Leno gets his way.
Although the city has helped three women's shelters in town, there
has never been a safe place for gay men fleeing domestic violence.
