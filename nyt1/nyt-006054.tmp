Smith, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, is using
the layoff numbers to bolster his insistence that companies
employing foreign workers take specific steps to protect the jobs
of U.S. workers steps that companies are strenuously fighting.
The companies and their trade associations said Smith is making
a connection where there is none. Jerry Jasinowski, president of
the National Association of Manufacturers, said the layoff numbers
have little to do with a shortage of qualified U.S. technical
workers and the companies' desire to hire the best workers, no
matter where they come from.
The disagreement is the latest skirmish in what is becoming an
increasingly entrenched battle between Smith and the business
community over H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled foreign
workers to hold jobs with U.S. companies for up to six years.
This year's allotment of 65,000 visas ran out almost six weeks
ago, and companies and their would-be employees are anxious for
Congress to make more visas available immediately and to boost the
number of H-1Bs available in coming years. The Senate has passed
legislation that would increase the visas, but the House version written by Smith is stalled because of corporate opposition to
the requirements he would impose on companies.
Videva spoke Tuesday at a Capitol Hill press conference
sponsored by business and pro-immigration groups that are anxious
to see the House approve more visas. Outside the conference,
Smith's spokesman, Allen Kay, distributed the congressman's news
release questioning corporate layoffs.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Whatever happens with today's United States
Golf Association press conference regarding equipment, there's no
likely need to panic. Do expect something long-term, but don't
presume anything immediate. The blue blazers and white caps won't
be riding herd with the 156 participants today, ordering them to
play the first round of the U.S. Open with persimmon woods,
nonperimeter weighted irons, a low-tech golf ball, plaid
bell-bottoms and Ban-Lon shirts.
Speculation has been rampant ever since the USGA said it was
studying possible restrictions on the kind of high-tech, highly
successful equipment that has been helping amateurs and pros all
over the globe come a little closer to figuring out the game of
golf. The USGA is concerned that technology is taking away from
talent and that in 20 years you'll need a 750-yard par-5 to protect
Old Man Par.
Expecting the worst, equipment manufacturers such as Ely
Callaway have been advising consumers to do everything but sleep
with their Big Bertha drivers. It's unlikely, however, that the
USGA, on the eve of its showcase championship, would unload a
blockbuster announcement to cause panic in the golf industry.
In fact, despite theorizing you may have read about oversized,
titanium drivers soon going the way of the T. rex, until the USGA
brass met this past weekend in San Francisco, it had not decided
precisely what would be said at a press conference The Golf Channel
will televise live.
The USGA is not expected to announce any rules changes today.
More likely is the announcement of a USGA task force to study the
equipment matter probably containing some people from the golf
industry, to help deflect potential legal problems. Any future
mandates are likely to contain a reasonable grace period, probably
by 2000. Plus, any changes would have to be discussed with Europe's
ruling body, the Royal Ancient Golf Club in Scotland.
