Although he leaves Seattle with his team six games in front of
the beaten opponents, Fielder remains a wary observer.
The Mariners' annual $1.8 million take for allowing their park
to be called Safeco Field for 20 years is more than twice the fees
that corporations paid to put their names on Coors Field in Denver,
Jacobs Field in Cleveland or KeyArena in Seattle.
The Mariners thus will become the 11th major league baseball
team to play in a stadium with a corporate sponsor's name on it.
Before 1990, no baseball teams played in a stadium with a corporate
sponsor. In just that short span, naming-rights fees have become an
integral component in financing hundreds of millions of dollars in
stadium construction around the country.
In return, companies with naming rights deals enjoy years of
name marketability and publicity that has untold value on business,
according to Brenner.
When the 3Com telecommunications company purchased the naming
rights to Candlestick Park in San Francisco five years ago for $4
million, the company told Team Marketing Reports that its stock
trading volume went up and the number of qualified applicants for
jobs also increased from other parts of the country.
Safeco hopes to get similar national exposure from purchasing
the naming rights from the Mariners. Company officials intend to
draw comparisons between Safeco's insurance business and baseball.
Dickey said Safeco, which also sponsors the Safeco Classic LPGA
golf tournament in Kent every year, researched the value of several
other naming-rights deals before entering into their agreement with
the Mariners.
The wave of stadium naming-rights deals spread in the late 1980s
with the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles, the Delta Center in
Salt Lake City and ARCO Arena in Sacramento, followed by the United
Center in Chicago and the Target Center in Minneapolis, all
National Basketball Association venues. Now there are 18 NBA teams
playing in arenas with naming rights sold to corporate or private
sponsors and 56 teams total in the NBA, major league baseball,
National Football League and National Hockey League.
In the Mariners' case, the money will help offset the minimum of
$45 million that the team is obligated to pay as its share of the
$417 million ballpark. Over the 20-year life of the deal with
Safeco, the Mariners will receive about $40 million for the naming
rights when the annual figures are adjusted for inflation.
Mariner president Chuck Armstrong noted the team already has
paid about $22.5 million of its share for stadium construction,
which is just over half complete.
