Betsey and Lulu set to work adjusting the dress, which fastened
up the front with hooks and eyes that reveal a gold-lace bra.
Betsey pinned the garment until it was skin-tight, then decided it
should be shorter.
Instead, the four films, starting at 8 p.m. CDT Tuesday, are
touching and funny, insightful and quirky, sharp and even a little
odd. All carry the independent's stamp of risk, individuality and
freshness that comes from filmmakers with nothing to lose and
everything to gain, like a trip to Sundance or, heck, Cannes.
Top-notch performances come from all those involved,
particularly Kashmir Jones, who plays the young girl who narrates
but doesn't speak until the end, and Karen Young, playing her
bewildered mother. This is rare in such low-budget films.
We even get to learn a thing or two about the filmmakers. They
appear with host Penny Marshall to answer her sometimes silly,
sometimes serious questions about their craft.
Hart is based in London. According to her bio, her projects
range from studio features to documentaries for the BBC. She shares
the story of becoming a filmmaker after tiring of being an agent
and baby sitter for writers and directors.
ALBANY, N.Y. The thousands of pale, lifeless faces he has
gazed upon over four decades don't haunt him. Most of the names are
a blur. It's the images of the organs abnormal or lacerated,
poisoned or punctured that remain with Dr. Michael Baden.
The corpses Baden has examined through the years the heroin
overdoses and motor vehicle fatalities and victims of drug deals
gone bad among them never made the headlines.
But Baden is best known for being a key figure in examining some
of the most spectacular deaths of this and other generations, from
the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and civil rights leaders Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers, to the deaths of comedian
John Belushi and Czar Nicholas of Russia, to the autopsies of
victims of Trans World Airlines Flight 800.
The spotlight on this coroner-cum-celebrity pathologist reached
its zenith during the O.J. Simpson trial, when he testified on
behalf of the defense.
While Baden isn't shy about talking about his accomplishments,
he explains away some of the high-profile cases as a result of a
shortage of board-certified forensic pathologists in the country less than 300 by his count, with none found in 12 states.
