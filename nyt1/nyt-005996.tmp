These moves may be in time to rescue the economy. But things
would have been much better, for Japan and the rest of Asia, if
they had come in 1992.

WASHINGTON Just like the advent of the first millennium, the
approach of the year 2000 is bringing dire predictions of disaster.
Doomsayers are warning of aircraft falling from the sky, riots,
famine, martial law and stock market crashes.
This time, however, the warnings are based not on superstition
but on hardheaded analyses of the potentially devastating effects
of the so-called millennium bug the inability of computers to
recognize the year 2000 because past programmers used only two
digits to denote years, without identifying the century.
A few scattered optimists still argue that the problem has been
grossly exaggerated, and it is true that some of the worst-case
scenarios are overly hysterical. But most experts insist that it is
now too late to avoid serious disruptions.
Several hundred professionals surveyed by the Washington D.C.
Year 2000 Group rated the impact of the problem on the United
States at an average of just under five on a scale of zero to 10 with 10 representing the collapse of the U.S. government and
possible famine.
A rating of five signified mild recession, isolated food, fuel
and power shortages, disruption of transport services such as
trucking and air travel and runs on banks. Some people, however,
fear it will be much worse.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
told a recent conference organized by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington that there was a 60 percent
chance of a severe global recession and that Wall Street could fall
by 30 percent next year.
Much will depend on how far governments and private businesses
succeed in defusing the time bomb over the next 18 months. Nobody,
however, believes that all the errors will be corrected not even
in the United States, which leads the world in tackling the
problem.
Most other countries are far behind. Instead of giving priority
to the millennium bug, Asia is largely focusing on resolving its
financial crisis and Europe on introducing its single currency, the
euro. Many developing countries are hardly aware of the danger.
