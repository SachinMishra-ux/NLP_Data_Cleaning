PA-SCHUYLKILL-OHARA (Pottsville, Pa.) For a fleeting moment,
you are Julian English and the road is yours, roaring in a sleek
Caddie through scenic highways of fact and fiction, past coal patch
taverns and slatty wood houses, gin cocktail parties and country
clubs vibrating to the tunes of Tommy Lake's Royal Collegians. The
terrain is Schuylkill County, the shovel-shaped anthracite coal
region of eastern Pennsylvania, which is barely disguised in the
plentiful short stories and novels of John O'Hara.
He has piercing brown eyes that could make her forget Jeff
Gordon and a smile that would give a milk mustache an R rating.
He has an A.J. Foyt kind of swagger and driving ability that
transcends debates about open wheels and fenders.
He has a 1997 Indy Racing League championship for Team Menard
tucked under his arm, and he's walking away from it all.
He was its matinee idol, the young American driver that the
league, in its third season, wanted to promote and nurture and
showcase in its centerpiece race, the Indianapolis 500.
Imagine Gordon defecting to the Championship Auto Racing Teams
series virtually ripping the sweet heart out of NASCAR. That's
what Stewart's departure from this fledgling league is being
compared with, but it's not entirely an honest comparison.
After winning 1995 U.S. Auto Club titles in sprint, midget and
Silver Crown divisions, Stewart signed a three-year deal with Harry
Ranier's NASCAR Busch Grand National team that November. The next
January, his agent negotiated a deal with John Menard to give
Stewart a ride in the Indy Racing League.
He hasn't so much outgrown the league as he was spirited away
from it: Joe Gibbs bought Ranier's team and agreed to allow Stewart
to focus on IRL this year while racing BGN on off-weekends with the
intent of moving him up to Winston Cup next season.
Buhl and teammate J.J. Yeley, 21, don't see Stewart's departure
as the death knell for the league pointing to up-and-comers like
Foyt-protege Billy Boat. Nor do they see it as a permanent
abandonment.
After finishing second last season at Indianapolis, engine
problems handed Stewart a last-place finish two weeks ago. Hoping
to emulate his idol, Foyt, Stewart longs to win Winston Cup's
Daytona 500 and the IRL's Indy 500 before his career is through.
Gibbs has consented to letting him drive in the Indy 500.
