If the outcome was unexpected by many, so was the political
component of the match. A vigorous protest was launched not against
the Great Satan, but rather against Iran's own Islamic regime.
Thousands of middle-class Iranian expatriates smuggled T-shirts
into Gerland Stadium showing the pictures of two leaders of a
Paris-based opposition group called the National Council of
Resistance.
French police rushed into the stands several times to confiscate
banners and pictures celebrating the two dissident leaders, but new
banners and pictures kept popping up like mushrooms. The opposition
group's influence is considered to be limited inside Iran, but the
size of the protest was undoubtedly an embarrassment to the Islamic
regime.
In the game's most surreal moment, the protesters waved their
T-shirts and banners jubilantly at halftime as the public-address
system played the Macarena. About 75 French policemen in riot gear
marched to one side of the field 10 minutes before the game
concluded, but the Iranian fans left peacefully and ecstatically.
This was the first time that Iran and the United States had met
in soccer competition and the first time that Iran ever won a game
in two trips to the World Cup. The countries exchanged visits by
their Olympic-style wrestling teams this year, and have
participated in the Summer Olympic Games, but this was the most
visible head-to-head sporting event between the two countries since
the Islamic revolution in 1979.
The match was played several days after President Clinton called
for reconciliation with Iran after 19 years of enmity between the
two countries, and it followed a call in January by President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran for cultural exchanges between the two
countries. In victory on Sunday night, Iranian players said it was
significant to have defeated the Americans.
In Tehran, thousands of celebrating fans took to the streets,
some of them women without their scarves, despite efforts by the
Islamic regime to make sure that the celebration was not as
vociferous as it had been last November when Iran qualified for the
World Cup for the first time in 20 years. Political experts said
that the conservative clerics who hold power in Iran were
threatened by the joyful outburst of the people last fall, which
they could not control.
On Sunday night, restaurants in Tehran were forced to close at 9
p.m., plans to show the game on giant outdoor television screens
were canceled and anti-riot police and plainclothes police set up
roadblocks around the city to make sure that the celebration was
not too forceful. Still, the Iranian players said they knew the
ordinary people of Iran would be exultant.
While Iran (1-1) is sure to have its hopes of advancing to the
second round dashed on Thursday when it faces powerful Germany, at
least it can dream. The United States (0-2) will now play a
meaningless game on Thursday against Yugoslavia.
If the United States was a serious soccer country, Coach Steve
Sampson might have lost his job on Sunday night, as coaches from
Saudi Arabia and South Korea did in recent days. But Rothenberg
said Sampson would coach the team against Yugoslavia. Sampson made
five lineup changes on Sunday night, scrapping the 3-6-1 formation
for a 3-5-2 with Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle at forwards and Tab
Ramos, Frankie Hejduk and Joe-Max Moore assuming roles in midfield.
Sampson wanted assertive play after Monday's tentative loss to
Germany, and on Sunday night the Americans hit the goalpost twice
and the crossbar once, but they could not score a goal. In fact,
they came forward so aggressively and took so many risks that they
were left completely out of shape on defense.
