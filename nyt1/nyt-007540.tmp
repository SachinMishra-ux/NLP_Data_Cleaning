Defensive end Marcus Johnson intercepted a pass and blocked an
extra point to earn MVP honors for Florida. Georgia Tech signee Joe
Burns carried the ball 17 times for 42 yards and scored on a 3-yard
run. Demetrick Moore, a Georgia Military signee from Ware County,
added 38 yards on 11 carries. Washington County graduate Terrence
Edwards was the game's leading receiver with 79 yards, including a
70-yard TD catch. Georgia trailed 21-20 with 2:56 to play when it
took over at the Florida 49. Two runs netted just four yards. On
third down, Regan Torbert was under heavy pressure and unloaded a
short pass to Wansley, who cut off his deep route and turned it
into an 18-yard gain.
Two Moore runs resulted in another first down at the Florida 13
and gave Georgia coach Rodney Walker a chance to play for the
winning field goal. Two runs at right tackle left Gwaltney with a
33-yard attempt from the right hash mark.
WASHINGTON Johnny Chung, a former fund-raiser for the
Democrats turned federal witness, has named several Democratic
Party officials whose aggressive encouragement, his lawyer says,
may have caused him to step over the line.
Chung has given detailed briefings about his conversations with
party officials to federal investigators, his lawyer, Brian A. Sun,
confirmed in an interview. Sun did not say who the officials were.
Chung had previously given federal investigators what
Republicans said was the first hard evidence that China had planned
to influence the 1996 presidential election.
As top Democrats accused Chung of betraying their trust, by
apparently acting as a conduit for illegal foreign money into the
party's coffers, Sun offered a stiff retort.
Senior Democratic National Committee officials had suspicions
about Chung as early as March 1995, but that never stopped
Democrats and White House officials from soliciting money from him
in the run-up to the 1996 elections, according to depositions and
Senate investigators.
The worst fears of top Democrats materialized last month when it
was revealed that Chung had told federal investigators he funneled
nearly $100,000 from a Chinese military officer to the Democrats in
1996. Chung gave the Democrats a total of $366,000, which was
returned after questions about the money.
In March, Chung, a southern California businessman, pleaded
guilty to charges of campaign-related bank and tax fraud, and he is
to be sentenced on July 20. He is cooperating with the Justice
Department's campaign-finance inquiry.
From the back of his taxicab one morning in 1996, the Democratic
National Committee chairman, Donald L. Fowler, saw Chung standing
on the doorstep of the committee headquarters near Capitol Hill.
