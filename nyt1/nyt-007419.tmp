Romagna and Emil (Bus) Mosbacher Jr., who was Intrepid's skipper
in 1967, led their United States America's Cup team to victory
against the Australian challenger, Dame Pattie, in a 4-0 sweep.
During the cup races of 1980 and 1983, Romagna served as
secretary of the America's Cup Selection Committee of the New York
Yacht Club, which was the guardian of the America's Cup for 132
years.
In 1983, when the club finally lost its ornate silver trophy to
Australia, Romagna was one of the first to concede that he had
mixed feelings about seeing it go. He had become increasingly
agitated over the creeping commercialism in cup racing and bemoaned
the loss of amateurism in the sport.
Romagna was born in Port Washington, N.Y., and lived there until
1981, when he retired to Annapolis. He learned to sail on Manhasset
Bay and competed on Long Island Sound during the 1940s in several
classes of small boats. When he was 17, he sailed in his first
Newport Bermuda Race.
He competed in 22 Bermuda races, two trans-Atlantic competitions
and three British Fastnet Races. He was inducted into the America's
Cup Hall of Fame in 1994 and was an honorary trustee of the South
Street Seaport in New York. He was sailing coach at the U.S. Naval
Academy from 1981 to 1989.
Romagna served in the Coast Guard during World War II. From 1960
to 1981, he worked at Ivy Hill Corp. a printing firm, and was vice
president of sales when he retired.
He is survived by his wife, Louise; three daughters, Lisa
Frappaolo, of Port Washington, Marion Jones, of Catonsville, Md.,
and Lenore Alexander, of Annapolis; a brother, Leonard, of Sun City
Center, Fla., and four grandchildren.
Federal officials, who were alerted to the study by an anonymous
complaint, investigated whether the surgeons violated guidelines
governing informed consent in human experiments, but determined
that they had no jurisdiction in the case. The study was published
in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in December 1996,
but has only recently been noticed outside the field.
The study involved 20 women and a man, whose average age was 59,
who went to Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in 1992 and 1993
for face lifts, for which they paid. On one half of the face,
surgeons cut the skin at the hairline and pulled it back and up.
They pulled and tightened the underlying muscle, as if gathering
the pleats of a skirt, but did not cut it.
In the second, more aggressive procedure, other surgeons cut
beneath skin and tissue from the side of the face toward the nose,
cut and pulled the underlying muscle back and upward, then
reattached it. Some believe this procedure to be more effective in
the long run, but it also carries a higher chance that nerves will
be accidentally cut and the face partly paralyzed.
