That is, with the exception of a lapse in the fourth, which
prompted a visit from Kerrigan. So why did it take so long to
detect Avery's delivery problem, and to correct it?
CHICAGO With 3:32 left in the first quarter of Game 3 of the
NBA Finals Sunday night, Karl Malone tossed in a pretty turnaround
fall-away jumper over Dennis Rodman to give the Jazz a 14-9 lead
over the Bulls, and himself a 6-for-6 start from the field.
At that point, the Jazz should have walked off the United Center
floor and caught a flight home. It would have saved them the abject
humiliation that was to follow over the next 44-plus minutes.
Considering what did transpire, the state of Utah would be well
within its rights to deny the Jazz re-entry and send them back to
their original home of New Orleans.
The Bulls took the Jazz apart at the seams, starting with a run
of 12 straight points after Malone's jumper and ending only with
the merciful final buzzer completing a 96-54 massacre. In the
process, the five-time champs slammed the Jazz into several
undesirable areas of the record book.
Not only did the Jazz lose by the largest margin ever in a
Finals game, and not only did they set single-game scoring lows in
the Finals and the playoffs overall they scored fewer points than
any team in any game since the shot clock was adopted in 1954-55.
The Indiana Pacers, who played without leading scorers Reggie
Miller and Rik Smits that day, managed just 55 against the Spurs in
a regular-season game back on March 29. This Jazz team had its full
complement of players, the same ones that had the league's best
regular-season record.
It was such a thorough dismantling, Michael Jordan was almost an
afterthought. His role in the defensive lockdown was crucial, with
his smothering of Jeff Hornacek and his trapping pressure; at the
other end he scored 24 points, including another entry into the
permanent highlight reel, a second-quarter layup in which he
switched the ball from right hand to left in midair.
Malone hardly did: after briefly redeeming himself from his
14-of-41 performance in the first two games, he managed to take
only five shots and hit two after his 6-for-6 start. He finished
with a meek 22 points, three rebounds and seven turnovers, three of
which were offensive fouls.
Even during Malone's big start, the Bulls were putting down the
foundation for arguably the greatest defensive game ever. Their
traps from all over the court prevented John Stockton from even
getting the ball upcourt efficiently, as well as keeping the Jazz
from either picking or rolling. Ron Harper made a complete nuisance
of himself to Stockton and added eight points, 10 rebounds and
seven assists in his best overall showing of the series. The Jazz
committed 26 turnovers, tying a franchise playoff record; Stockton
had five by himself.
The upshot of all this was a series of Jazz droughts that began
after Malone's late first-quarter jumper. Nearly six minutes went
by before they scored again. Starters Hornacek and Bryon Russell
went scoreless until the final five minutes of the half. The Bulls
finished the half with a 12-2 run in just 2:27. The Jazz trailed
49-31 at halftime, with their total tying for the second fewest
points in a half.
And that was their (begin ital) good (end ital) half: in the
second half they set a new mark with just 23 points. Their
fourth-quarter total of nine was also a record, as was their 21
total field goals and the Bulls' 42-point margin of victory.
