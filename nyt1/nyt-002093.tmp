On Wednesday, a 2-year-old girl died after a few minutes in her
family's sweltering minivan. Elizabeth Eunson's siblings and mother
were cooling off in a backyard pool Wednesday when she wandered out
to the van, climbed in through an open door and got stuck when the
door slid shut behind her, authorities said.
About 15 minutes passed before the family realized Elizabeth was
missing, said Detective Stacey Barrentine of the Pinellas County
Sheriff's Office. By the time they pulled her from the van, it was
too late.

Tuesday at a hospital.

Local residents resorted to sundry methods, both ordinary and
unusual, in their efforts to beat the heat.
In Martin County residents filled their rapidly warming pools
with 300-pound blocks of ice. Ice distributors said they have been
racing to keep up with the sooner-than-expected peak summer demand.
Palm Beach County residents were slightly more prosaic in their
quest for cool. Hardware and home supply stores were doing a brisk
business in fans, air conditioners, and anything else that might
get a breeze going.
At a Home Depot in suburban Lake Worth, Assistant Manager Howie
Murphy said his store was churning anything that might reduce the
heat.
