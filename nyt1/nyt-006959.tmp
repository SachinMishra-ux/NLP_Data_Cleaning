Four other products, made by Amway, Equinox International Corp.,
QMP Inc. and Waterboss International, were below the federal level
but above the stricter Proposition 65 level of 0.5 parts per
billion.
One independent authority who reviewed the study called it
sound. Donald Smith, a lead specialist at the University of
California at Santa Cruz, said that, if anything, the study
underestimated the exposure levels.
The Center for Environmental Health recommended that consumers
run water for 10 seconds before filling a glass to remove water
with the highest lead levels.
Franke and other manufacturers said they had not seen the study
and declined to comment directly on its results.
But many noted that their products had been certified as safe by
a national certification group and by the California Department of
Health Services, both of which use the less restrictive federal
standard.
Industry officials said the study underscored the problem of
complying with conflicting standards in California.
The head of the state's certification program said manufacturers
have long been warned that certification would not protect them
from Proposition 65 lawsuits. And he said the study might force a
re-evaluation of the federal standard.
The Proposition 65 suits against makers of water filtration
systems stem from a similar campaign by environmental groups
against the makers of kitchen faucets.
Using the California law, the groups have forced manufacturers,
at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, to virtually eliminate
the lead that can leach from taps into drinking water.
Eric Somers, an attorney for the Center for Environmental
Health, said that water filtration systems simply fell through the
cracks when environmental groups were pursuing faucet
manufacturers.
