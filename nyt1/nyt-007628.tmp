LONDON He is a fan of pop music and fast food, an avid swimmer
and tennis player. He prefers action adventure books to novels and
even likes the swallow-tail coat, starched collar and striped
trousers he must wear at Eton.
Sixteen years old Sunday, the winsome young man destined to be
king of England says that the only uncomfortable part of his life
is dealing with the shrieking teen-age girls who swoon at his
sight.
With his exams at Eton finished, Prince William celebrated his
birthday Sunday out of public view with friends at an undisclosed
location and spoke to his family on the telephone.
But aides to his father, Prince Charles, at St. James' Palace,
are seeking to balance the young man's need for privacy with the
widespread interest in him. They published a mass of details about
his adolescence culled from official records and answers he gave to
written questions from The Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency.
What emerged was a portrait of a youth mature beyond his age but
with the normal enthusiasms and tastes of a teen-ager intact after
a tumultuous year that forced him into a public role long before
anyone intended.
Publication of the managed information was seen as a reward to
the British press for its adherence to Press Complaint Commission
rules made more strict to shield Prince William and his brother,
Prince Harry, after the death of their mother, Diana, princess of
Wales, in an automobile crash in Paris last Aug. 31.
Next in line to the throne after his father, William attracted
enormous sympathy and admiration by the dignity and fortitude of
his participation in Diana's funeral. He accepted flowers from
mourners outside Buckingham Palace with remarkable composure and
then strode solemnly behind her coffin in the procession from St.
James' Palace to Westminster Abbey.
Under the tightened press guidelines, the two boys can be
photographed only at carefully rationed arranged occasions, usually
with their father.
It was one of those moments, a ski trip to Vancouver, British
Columbia, last March, that alerted the palace to what a pin-up the
6-foot-1-inch prince with the shock of blond hair, blue eyes and
downward-looking shy smile so reminiscent of his mother has become
to teen-age girls. Hundreds of them gave him a weeping and
screaming rock star greeting as he playfully tried on a red
Canadian team Winter Olympics beret and grinned in embarrassment.
He professed to like school, a marked contrast to his father's
loathing of the ascetic Gordonstoun school in Scotland that he
attended at the same age. William plans to focus on geography,
biology and history of art, and has not decided yet what university
he will apply to. His father studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.
