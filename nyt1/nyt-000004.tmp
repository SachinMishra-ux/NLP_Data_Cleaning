But while its residential areas are fetchingly rustic,
Sloatsburg's main street, along Highway 17, is a gap-toothed
stretch of gas stations and shops, without a distinct downtown and
lacking any of the Main Street charm other rural towns have striven
to achieve. Opponents of the town house project say mass
development would only add to the downscale look of their town's
business stretch. 
Mrs. Kern and her husband, Greg, bought their old, gabled
Victorian fixer-upper seven years ago and now have two little
girls. Their home on Eagle Valley Road stands almost across from
where the entrance to a potential floating zone development could
descend.
At a packed public meeting on May 18, about 400 residents broke
the maximum occupancy rules at the Senior Citizens Center to
upbraid Abate and the three-member town board (one had resigned,
reportedly because of the pressure of the zoning issue).
One speaker supported the change: Frank Dailey, a developer who
had been frustrated by the town before. Every other speaker was
opposed: Harrison Bush worried about sewer costs, Dan Simone said
the local schools would be destroyed, Rich Gurasser said young
people would be squeezed out of town and across the line into
Orange County, and Pat Kleese worried about the fate of the bear
that occasionally forages for garbage at the end of her road if the
Hovnanian project were built up to her lot.
And there was a more subtle note of concern, a note about what
kind of people might come, expressed by a speaker who asked whether
or not social service agencies would be allowed to rent any of the
new row houses for their clients.
Troy Osborne, 28, a fifth-generation Sloatsburger, rents a home
for himself and his wife from a friend in the Flats, in the old
downtown section, while he builds his truck repair business. But he
rejected bate's contention that young families like his need new
housing.
PORT CHESTER, N.Y. Compared with small boxing events in other
parts of the country, the fights held here in April at the Capitol
Theater looked like a police officers' convention. Clumps of men in
sport coats with badges and New York State Athletic Commission
emblems guarded the dressing-room doors. Corner inspectors in
surgical gloves leaned over the ropes to monitor the fighters and
their trainers between rounds, and were rotated at the bell, with a
new inspection team for each bout.
That level of regulatory presence would be unthinkable in many
states. But whether it is zealous, invaluable attention to fighter
safety or wasteful extravagance is a question central to the debate
about what New York taxpayers get for their money in boxing
regulation.
Over the years, the state athletic commission has been
criticized as a political patronage operation. Some boxing experts
have recently questioned the credentials of the commission's
doctors.
Still, when compared with other states, New York clearly
requires more medical screening of fighters and operates with a
budget that dwarfs those elsewhere.
