The Boys from Barcelona arrived in Paris a dozen strong of 19
Spaniards entered in the 128-man chase, and it came down to the
6-foot-3-inch kid from Avenida Foix to follow in the sneaker steps
of his Davis Cup captain, Manolo Santana, the champ of 1961 and
1964, Andres Gimeno, 1972, and Bruguera.
Corretja, losing six of his 15 service games, including the
opener, was in trouble from the moment Moya whacked a forehand to
win the first point of the day. He couldn't penetrate, and his
rolling topspin was no problem for the tall Moya.
Moya shuffled around his backhand quickly to brutalize second
serves with forehands, whammed a service winner to duck an early
break point and reach 4-2, and patiently waited for openings as
Corretja struggled fiercely to escape break points and set points
deep in the second set. But there was no way for him to hold off
Moya for long.
Corretja, 24, the guy who turned Sampras's stomach inside out
and held a match point in that dramatic US Open quarterfinal of
1996, couldn't produce similar form Sunday. He had made his mark on
the French a week before by outlasting Gumy in 5 hours 31 minutes,
the longest major tournament match, and his ordeal at Moya's hands
may have seemed as long though not as draining.
During an afternoon of rare good sporting feeling each man
contradicted judgments of line officials and awarded points to his
friend.
Then the audience won as the great soccer player, Pele, who led
Brazil to World Cups in 1958-62-70, appeared on the podium to help
present the prize, the sterling Coupe de Mousquetaires. Pele hugged
Moya and Corretja and, as soccer balls materialized, ping-ponged
headers with both men before the Spaniards booted the balls into
the crowd. Along with Pele was 82-year-old Don Budge, who won the
title 60 years ago, the second leg of the original Grand Slam.
Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Michael Chang may have evaporated fast,
but Budge gave the final an American presence.
OAKLAND, Calif. Add the A's to the long list of people in
baseball who just don't like the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Deep into a 12-4 Diamondbacks rout Sunday that lost its suspense
early, Arizona manager Buck Showalter instructed reliever Russ
Springer to hit an A's hitter in retaliation for the A's hitting
Yamil Benitez.
That might not have incensed the A's on its own. No, what had
them so irate was A) the choice of rookie Ben Grieve (a.k.a. The
Franchise) as the target for the message pitch; and B) plunking him
in the ninth inning.
Showalter did not actually confirm that he ordered Springer to
throw at Grieve, grazing him on his side. But he left no room for
doubt.
