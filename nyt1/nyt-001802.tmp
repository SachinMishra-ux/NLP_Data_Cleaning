This is harrowingly familiar. Seven years ago Milosevic's
attempt to enlarge Serbia's share of Yugoslavia which then
included Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia cost at least
100,000 lives.
Familiar, too, is the dilemma faced by western leaders: should
they watch the bloodshed, as they did for too long in Bosnia, or
risk compatriots' lives and their own political careers by getting
involved in somebody else's war, as America did in Vietnam?
Muscular diplomacy, they had hoped, would save them. The Contact
Group America, Russia and the four big West European countries punished Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo with sanctions. Even as
he continued to pound the Albanians, he agreed to talk to their
leader; sanctions were eased. But the West now admits it will have
to do more.
The separatists use both countries (and Montenegro) as havens
and as conduits for arms. Milosevic's forces might well be tempted
to chase them across borders, setting off a wider war.
Last week foreign ministers from NATO's 16 members decided to
upgrade a military exercise in Macedonia and launch one in Albania.
The goal is sensible: to warn off Serbia and bolster the stability
of two governments that have so far steered clear of Kosovo's war.
Yet even these modest reassurances pull NATO into dangerous
territory. Two countries that serve as bases for attacks on
Yugoslavia, albeit not deliberately, now have an implicit security
guarantee. To protect them, NATO may have to go beyond the
hand-holding measures it has planned so far.
Nor, lastly, should NATO police Albania's chaotic northeast,
where an outlaw mini-state run by adherents of the ex-president,
Sali Berisha, terrorizes the locals and succors Kosovo's
guerrillas.
A NATO operation should have one mission: to deter organized
aggression and, if necessary, repel it by force.
NATO's strategists suggest 23,000 troops would be needed along
the 140-kilometer (90-mile) border between Kosovo and Albania. That
is too many, especially if the force is not to be expected to
intercept arms and guerrillas. NATO needs only enough troops to
back up its deterrent role: it can watch borders from the air and
send extra troops in case of attack.
Even if this were to succeed, NATO would have other worries.
Albanians are not angels. While Serb police mop up separatist
settlements, the Kosovo Liberation Army has driven some Kosovo
Serbs out of their villages; in a province that is nine-tenths
Albanian, the guerrillas look the likelier ethnic cleansers.
