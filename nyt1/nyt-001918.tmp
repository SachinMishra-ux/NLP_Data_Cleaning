Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.
An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
