Investors who skip blithely from fund to fund, beware. More
funds are imposing redemption fees to trip up those who are fleet
of foot, fund experts say, and the fees are carrying nastier
stings.
Unlike back-end loads, or deferred sales charges typically
used to pay brokers redemption fees are returned to the fund's
asset base. They average 1 percent of the assets being redeemed and
are intended to discourage short-term players, like market timers
or those who simply change their minds a lot.
The fees, however, are usually not imposed for long. According
to Lipper Analytical Services, a research firm based in Summit,
N.J., the average redemption fee is in effect for about seven
months from the date of purchase. After that, investors can get out
without paying a toll.
Among the fund companies that are upping the redemption ante is
Fidelity Investments, the industry giant. A number of Fidelity
funds already carry redemption fees of up to 1.5 percent, typically
for redemptions within 90 days of purchase. But the new Fidelity
Small Cap Stock fund charges 3 percent and the fee is levied if
an investor skips within the first three years.
Does that sound like a long time to stick around? Consider the
five-year tenure required by tax-managed funds from the Vanguard
Group, which impose a redemption fee that slides from 2 percent to
1 percent.
Some of the rules are a mite tricky. At Bridgeway Capital
Management, both Bridgeway Ultra-Large 35 Index and Bridgeway
Ultra-Small Index come with permanent redemption fees, but with a
twist: The 2 percent toll will be assessed, at the fund's
discretion, only if an investor sells after the Standard Poor's
500-stock index has fallen by 5 percent in the five previous
trading days.
Fickle investors take note: One way or another you're going to
pay to play.
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip For three months, Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat has watched warily while a political rival, Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Hamas movement,
has been received almost like a head of state by nearly a dozen
Muslim countries.
Tired of months without progress in peace talks with Israel, the
Islamic nations are signaling their dissatisfaction with the
hard-line policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
boosting the prestige of the Palestinian militant in a way that
plays to their own grumbling opposition.
