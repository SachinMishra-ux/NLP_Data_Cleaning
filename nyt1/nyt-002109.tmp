But TV politics are shown to TV audiences, who can't talk back.
National voting rates have declined, from 65 percent of eligible
voters in 1960 to less than 50 percent today. Can this have
something to do with the decline of real politics?
We cannot and should not, however, entirely blame television
which, in many cases, serves as an efficient means for engaging the
citizenry. The trick is to achieve a balance, which is not
difficult. It simply requires making TV politics more like real
politics.
An example: As campaign manager of a 1996 congressional
candidate in Massachusetts, I noted that statewide politics there
are treated more like a sporting event than a soap opera. John
Kerry and Bill Weld had six count 'em six hour-long televised
debates during prime time in the months before the general
election.
Journalists drove up public excitement, and citizens crowded
around TV sets in living rooms and bars. The next day, the debate
was the talk of the town.
But there is hope. After nominating workhorse Gray Davis, let's
get some real politics going between him and the Republican
nominee, Dan Lungren. Californians should advocate a grueling,
substantive, non-sound-bite set of at least five hour-long,
prime-time TV debates.
The networks will make money if the debates are publicized with
vim and vigor. And Californians will trust Lungren and Davis more
if they feel as if they've gotten to known them, at length and in
their own words.
California's leader should have the courage to step in front of
the crowd and risk a few rotten tomatoes, if that's what it takes.
Our greatest politicians, like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln,
gained their fame on the public platform. They look like giants
next to today's celluloid actors.

More than 100 of the 10,000 Jewish children who left Germany,
Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland on trains and then ships for
Britain between 1938 and 1940 are attending the reunion, some of
them meeting one another for the first time.
Those attending the reunion, which started Friday and goes
through Sunday in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., are
taking part in workshops, hearing speeches and sharing stories of
their lives after their escape. They will visit the United States
Holocaust Museum in Washington on Sunday.
