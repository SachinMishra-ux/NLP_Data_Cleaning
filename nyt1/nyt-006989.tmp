This was humiliating to them, insulting to Iran and directly
contrary to our interest in signaling a willingness to develop
better relations.
While we should take necessary precautions for security reasons
and for full observance of immigration laws, we should no longer
subject Iranians otherwise entitled to visas to long delays,
expenses and humiliation.
 (This commentary is adapted from a recent address by The
Honorable Lee H. Hamilton, member, U.S. House of Representatives,
before the Council on Foreign Relations, in Washington, D.C.) 
For the first time since 1979 when Iranian students seized and
held American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days there is the possibility of improved U.S.-Iran relations.
President Khatami wants to promote civil society and the rule of
law. He wants to end Iran's isolation. He wants to improve the life
of the Iranian people. He is reaching out to Iran's neighbors and
he is reaching out to the United States.
By himself, Khatami won't be able to reverse two decades of
strident anti-Americanism. He is engaged in a fierce power struggle
inside Iran, which remains bitterly divided between hard-line
conservatives and reformers.
I believe we need to begin a policy of engagement with Iran. It
will not be easy and it will take time to produce results, but I am
persuaded that such a policy serves the American national interest.
The United States should use several avenues for outreach to
Iran and its people. Just as President Khatami chose CNN to send
his message to the United States, President Clinton or a senior
U.S. official can talk directly to the Iranian people through
interviews on Iranian radio and TV, or on the Persian service of
Voice of America.
The United States is concerned about Iran's attitude toward the
Middle East peace process. But we should not simply say Iran is
totally opposed to the peace process. We are deeply concerned about
Iran's support for international terrorism. Yet as Khatami knows,
Iran too has paid a price for terrorism. It has paid in isolation
from Europe, deep suspicion from its neighbors and sanctions from
the United States.
 Is Iran imposing constraints on the military activities of
groups it has supported? Hezbollah in Lebanon has talked about
pulling back from the border with Israel if Israel withdraws from
Lebanon. We should test the Iranians' willingness to change words
into deeds.
