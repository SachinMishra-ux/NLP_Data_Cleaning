Last month, researchers at Britain's chemical and biological
defense laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire, reported that glowing
bacteria could be used to detect the use of chemical weapons. 
It is easy to dump waste in deep-ocean trenches far harder to
check that it hasn't seeped from its containers into the sea. Now,
though, colonies of glowing bacteria offer hope. When they sense
pollution in the water around them, they get dimmer.
Working with colleagues at the institute and at the U.S. Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington D.C., Jones has screened 10
species of luminous bacteria from fish and marine mammals. One of
the most promising is Photobacterium phosphoreum HE-1a, isolated
from the deep-sea fish Paratrachichthys prosthemius. In a
laboratory pressure chamber, the bacteria survived pressures of up
to 31 megapascals more than 300 times atmospheric pressure equivalent to a depth of around 3,000 meters.
The researchers found that P. phosphoreum HE-1a glowed up to 50
percent less brightly when exposed to a variety of potential
pollutants. These included heavy metals such as zinc, copper and
cobalt, as well as chemical pollutants, including pesticides,
polychlorinated biphenyls and polyaromatic hydrocarbons typically
found in oily wastes.
Jones and collaborators at the university's Center of Marine
Biotechnology have built a prototype cell that exposes a living
colony of the bacteria to seawater samples filtered through a
semipermeable membrane. A digital camera monitors the intensity of
light coming from the colony. When the cell is deployed on the
seafloor, any dimming of the usual signal can alert neighboring
sensors or samplers. The signals could be monitored remotely on
land or on a ship or rig.
To keep the colony alive, the bacteria will need to be fed from
a buoy or platform on the surface, from which nutrients could be
pumped down at a constant rate. Dead or aging bacteria would be
continuously jettisoned to keep the colony fresh.
He says the sentinel could provide a useful tool for evaluating
whether proposals for deep-sea dumping would be as environmentally
benign as their advocates claim.
Jones and his colleagues presented their preliminary findings
last month in Atlanta at the annual meeting of the American Society
for Microbiology. Their development highlights growing interest in
the use of light-emitting bacteria as sensors.
Last month, researchers at Britain's chemical and biological

The bull market in stocks has been long and lovely, but even
unsophisticated mutual fund investors understand the nature of
market risk. If the prices of many stocks in a fund's portfolio
drop, fund holders will lose, too.
