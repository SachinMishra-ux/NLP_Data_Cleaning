Conditions for the first round of the Open were about as good as
they are going to get.
Despite some tough pin placements, the greens remained
receptive, and those golfers in the fairway could get a little
aggressive with their second shots. The result was nine under-par
rounds on a course that some predicted might not give up a handful
of low scores all week.
Payne Stewart showed how much damage could be done early, making
birdies on the last three holes to take the first-round lead at
4-under-par 66. Stewart finished before many in the field had even
teed off, but his score held up. Mark Carnevale ended up second at
67, while Joe Durant, Tom Lehman, Jose Maria Olazabal and Bob Tway
were tied at 68.
But perhaps the biggest cheers were for a golfer who finished at
4-over-par 74. Casey Martin, who has been the center of attention
all week for using a golf cart, was clearly the crowd favorite.
Martin said he had trouble seeing on his final two holes, which
might have contributed to his bogey-bogey finish. But for the
remainder of the field, patience was the most important quality,
and Stewart had the most of it.
There were certainly players who could relate to that.
Pre-tournament favorite David Duval ended up at 5-over-par 75,
while Davis Love III closed at 78 and defending champion Ernie Els
was at 75. Tiger Woods started off well, getting to 2-under but
then struggled down the stretch and found himself 4-over for the
opening round.
But for those who kept their cool during the rough moments and
nearly everyone had at least one there were birdies to be made.
Durant, who is making his first Open appearance, was the only
player to really challenge Stewart's hold on the top spot all day.
Durant, a former Nike Tour player who is in his second year on the
PGA Tour, came out hot, making the turn at 31 and then taking lone
possession of the lead at 5-under when he made a spectacular pitch
to within one foot on No. 12 and sank the birdie putt.
But Durant stumbled on No. 14, leaving his chip shot short of
the green and three-putting from the fringe for double bogey. He
got one stroke back with a birdie on No. 15 but added bogeys on
Nos. 16 and 17.
Durant played in the same threesome as Carnevale, who was
equally pleased with his effort at Olympic Club. This is only
Carnevale's second Open, and he hasn't had a great year on the PGA
Tour to date. In 15 events, he has missed the cut 10 times. But he
certainly found his game in the first round.
