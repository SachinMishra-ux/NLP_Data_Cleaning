Those who arrive from Europe are confronted with crushing
poverty. The dusty towns in northern Albania often lack running
water and regular electricity. There is often no local authority,
other than a warlord and his group of armed henchmen. Many said
they were still trying to adjust to the chaos, poverty and
isolation.
AUSTIN, Texas A sharply divided Texas Supreme Court held
Friday that auto manufacturers can be held liable even if their
safety designs meet minimum standards for seat belts set by the
federal government.
The 5-4 ruling stems from a 1989 auto accident in which an
18-year-old man was left paralyzed from the chest down after being
thrown through the sunroof of a car that was not equipped with lap
seat belts.
Alvarado was a front seat passenger in a 1988 Hyundai Excel that
spun out of control on a rain-slickened roadway and rolled over.
The car was equipped with automatic shoulder belts, which engaged
when the doors closed, but the car did not have lap belts an
option permissible under minimum federal standards at the time,
according to court documents.
The case represents a rare victory for plaintiffs in the
conservative Texas Supreme Court, which is dominated by
Republicans.
The main question before the court was whether the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act which sets safety standards
that vehicle manufacturers must meet precludes consumers from
suing a manufacturer for damages sustained in a seat restraint
system that does not include lap belts.
She was joined by justices Raul Gonzalez, the only other
Democrat on the bench, and Republican justices Greg Abbott, James
Baker and Deborah Hankinson.
Lawyers for the auto manufacturer did not return calls from the
Houston Chronicle. But Donna Kane, spokeswoman for Hyundai Motor
America, told The Associated Press that lawyers had not yet seen
the opinion and could not comment on it.
Brown, the lawyer for Alvarados, said the ruling clears the
major roadblock her client has faced in pursuing the $18 million in
actual damages that a trial jury awarded him in 1991. Hyundai
appealed the jury award, but a San Antonio appeals court has
withheld ruling to allow the Supreme Court time to decide whether
Alvarados should have been barred from seeking damages in the first
place, Brown said.
She added that the Texas Supreme Court decision could lead
courts in other parts of the country to start holding auto
manufacturers liable for safety restraint systems that have not
adequately protected vehicle occupants. If it didn't have impact
beyond Texas, she said, Hyundai would not have gone to the lengths
it did to fight the case.
