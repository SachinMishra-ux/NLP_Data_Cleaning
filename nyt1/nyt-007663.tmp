Diana Jean Schemo and Tim Golden reported in The Times earlier
this month that much of the aid the Pentagon is giving Colombia's
military to fight cocaine is being used instead to fight
guerrillas. American special-forces trainers now work in Colombia,
teaching the military such skills as jungle maneuvering and
psychological operations. While the level of support is far below
American aid to the Salvadoran military in the 1980s, the
administration is unwisely considering an increase.
As in El Salvador, American aid is going to an abusive and inept
army fighting vicious Marxist guerrillas. The guerrillas kill
politicians and kidnap Americans. The military has strong ties to
paramilitary death squads, which massacre peasants and murder human
rights workers and left-wing politicians. Last year, 10 people a
day died in political murders. Seventy percent of the killings were
attributed to soldiers or paramilitaries.
Support for the army also undermines Colombia's precarious
civilian institutions. The military is defying a constitutional
court ruling to reform its justice system. Generals have openly
refused to obey presidential orders relating to peace.
The narco-guerrilla connection is disputed by many in the
Colombian government and the American State Department, who call it
a label invented by the Colombian military to allow them to use the
aid to fight guerrillas. Myles Frechette, the American ambassador
to Colombia until the end of 1997, publicly criticized the term,
and American intelligence services in 1996 concluded that the term
was far overblown. Ironically, there may be strong ties between the
paramilitaries and the traffickers. Colombia's investigative police
say Carlos Castano, a top paramilitary leader, heads a drug cartel.
As in El Salvador, peace talks are the only solution to a civil
war neither side can win. Colombians overwhelmingly endorsed talks
in a referendum last year, both candidates in the presidential
runoff election backed them, and previously recalcitrant guerrillas
are showing interest. Washington can best support the talks by
terminating its aid to a military that has undermined them. 
James Hormel, President Clinton's nominee to be ambassador to
Luxembourg, is opposed by a small group of Republican senators who
are looking smaller all the time.
It is not Hormel's credentials that are in question. An heir to
the Hormel meat-packing fortune, a former dean of the University of
Chicago Law School, he has given leadership and money to causes
that range from the San Francisco Symphony to Swarthmore College
and the Human Rights Campaign, the main political lobby for
homosexual rights.
Discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual
orientation is outlawed in Luxembourg and in all the other
countries in the European Union. It is illegal in San Francisco,
where Hormel lives, and in Washington except in such places as
Congress, where the Republican leadership has made a fetish of it
lately.
POCONO, Pa. With a lump in his throat and Jeff Gordon on his
rear bumper, Jeremy Mayfield beat down every challenge Sunday and
put victory No. 1 in his Winston Cup scrapbook.
The 29-year-old native of Owensboro, Ky. took the lead from his
hometown hero, Darrell Waltrip, on lap 180, and then had to hold
off Gordon over the final 21 laps, winning by a scant 0.341
seconds.
