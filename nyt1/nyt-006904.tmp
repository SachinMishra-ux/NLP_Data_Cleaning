Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu Kashmir from seceding?
All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
At the same time the West should do what it could to stabilize
Macedonia (offer aid in return for decent treatment of the ethnic
Albanians). But even this would probably be too little if the
interveners were not ready to get involved on the ground, as well
as in the air, to keep the peace.
That prospect is the nastiest of all for NATO, but, without it,
attacks on Kosovars would probably continue, the pledge to uphold
Serbia's integrity would be disbelieved and the bombing would be
seen as yet another empty western gesture. (To publish this excellent 1,000-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
