Any link to home makes Glavine a little sentimental, which is
why pitching Monday night's opener of the Red Sox-Braves series at
Turner Field still is special for the former National League Cy
Young winner and Most Valuable Player of the 1995 World Series.
Glavine could have traded in his Braves jersey a couple of years
ago when he became a free agent, but he decided not to leave a good
situation. He was there for the bad years in the late 1980s, so why
not stick around for the good times?
Since 1991, the Braves have been perennial contenders, and
Glavine has been one constant. He, along with manager Bobby Cox,
pitching coach Leo Mazzone, and to a degree John Smoltz, are the
last links to the bad Braves.
The high point of Glavine's career came in '95 when the Braves
won it all and Glavine won Game 6 of the World Series with a
sterling 1-0 masterpiece over the Cleveland Indians.
Since then the Braves have been good in the playoffs, but not
good enough, beaten in the NLCS by the expansion and wild-card
Florida Marlins last season.
The Braves are dominating the regular season again. Even with an
8-2 rec-ord and a 2.10 ERA, Glavine can't boast that he's the
team's best pitcher. There's Greg Maddux, 9-2, with a 1.69 ERA;
lefthander Denny Neagle, 7-3 with a 3.04 ERA; young Kevin Millwood,
8-2 with a 4.07 ERA; and, waiting in the wings, the injured Smoltz.
Filling in for Smoltz has been veteran Dennis Martinez, who has a
2-2 record and a 3.86 ERA.
Glavine says his own pitching hasn't changed a bit. He says in
any given year one pitch is working better than another. This year
he's rediscovered his breaking pitch to go with one of the best
changeups in the game and a fastball that seems a yard quicker when
he's getting his offspeed stuff over.
Glavine, like many in baseball, is baffled by the struggles of
Avery. At one time Avery and Glavine were inseperable, part of
baseball's most incredible staff. Glavine's great stuff and Avery's
dominating heat complemented each other well.
Glavine is thrilled that Williams has become a successful
manager. Williams was the third base coach and infield instructor
under Cox, and he also was the coach who worked with the pitchers
on their hitting.
 It was one of the longest, most exhausting three-game trips
the Giants had ever taken. It also turned out to be one of the
sweetest.
