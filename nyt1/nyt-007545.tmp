Maggert did manage to sink a nice 12-footer for birdie on No. 16
that got him back to 2 over for the tournament But the 17th hole
dealt him what might have been the fatal blow. Maggert hit what he
thought was a solid approach shot to the green, only to have the
ball catch the edge of the heavy greenside rough. He recovered with
a nice chip to within five feet but missed the par putt.
That has been the case too often for Maggert, who has 11
second-place finishes on tour. He has a solid record in major
championships in 22 major appearances since 1992, he has finished
in the top 10 eight times. But he still is seeking that big
victory.
Maggert came close last year. He spent a good portion of the
final round locked in a battle for the title with eventual champion
Ernie Els, Tom Lehman and Colin Montgomerie. But a couple of bogeys
midway through the day forced him to play aggressively. And he
closed with back-to-back double bogeys and finished fourth.
Unfortunately for Maggert, that is so true. And it's unlikely
Maggert will be able to change that today. But he still intends to
try.
But Maggert needs even more than that. The Olympic Club is one
of the most difficult courses the pros have faced in recent years.
Even Maggert was surprised at what the course threw at the golfers
Saturday.
Van Poppel, whom the Rangers purchased from Triple-A Oklahoma
before yesterday's game at Edison International Field of Anaheim,
could not record an out during the third inning before being
removed by Oates in the Angels' 8-3 victory.
Perisho, whom the Rangers recalled Tuesday from Triple-A
Oklahoma, registered only seven outs during his start Tuesday in a
9-7 loss to the Oakland Athletics at The Ballpark in Arlington.
Van Poppel delivered few strikes during his 75-pitch appearance,
but the first one he threw actually, his first pitch to Angels
leadoff hitter Darin Erstad glanced off the right-field foul pole
after leaving the first baseman's bat.
Van Poppel, who surrendered five runs on four hits, issued five
walks. Consecutive third-inning walks to catcher Phil Nevin and
left fielder Orlando Palmeiro brought Oates from his perch in the
dugout.
The Rangers supported Van Poppel with three runs before the
right-hander took the mound for his first major-league appearance
since Sept. 27, 1996. Left fielder Rusty Greer delivered a one-out,
run-scoring single, and a two-run home run from right fielder Juan
Gonzalez two pitches later gave the Rangers a 3-0 lead.
