The former little boys go to the meeting because the boss called
it, not because they want to discuss things. Their teams are
primed. The former little girls, on the other hand, actually think
they're going to talk about something.
The top-ranking former little boy makes a declarative statement.
The former little girls nod their heads, not necessarily because
they agree but just to show him they're listening politely.
Then one of the former little girls asks a question. The former
little boys shift in their seats. The head guy wishes the impudent
wench would be a good team player and not question the coach. And
why had she nodded her head, anyway, if she didn't agree?
Pffft. Write her off, some of the former little boys think to
themselves. She's so tentative. Unsure. Wimpy.
But most of the former little boys figure the boss is going to
win, so they cast their vote with the winner. It's a slam dunk. Two
of the little girls also vote with the boss. End of meeting.
The former little boys no matter who voted for what head
across the street for a beer. It's a strategic-alliance Kodak
moment.
One of the former little girls isn't speaking to another because
she feels betrayed by a friend. Another sheds conflict-inspired
tears in the restroom. Two continue talking at their desks.

This glumly amusing effort from writer//director Pal Sletaune
fairly oozes Scandinavian angst, from the pasty, beard-stubbled
visages of its characters to the slumlike buildings in which it
unfolds and the unrelenting gray atmosphere, which baths every
scene in a sort of dull, color-draining fluorescent light.
It's so dank and grim and Orwellian, in fact, that the film's
very joylessness becomes an intentional joke.
