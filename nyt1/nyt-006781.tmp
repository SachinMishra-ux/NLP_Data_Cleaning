In April, after GM's share of the U.S. vehicle market fell below
30 percent, the company sent previous customers certificates of
$500 to $1,000 to use toward the purchase of 50 models, above and
beyond other incentives. Ford and Chrysler matched GM's program
with their own loyalty incentives and agreed to accept GM's
certificates. GM has declined to take coupons from Ford and
Chrysler.
The industry is now closely watching strike developments at GM,
the largest automaker. Since workers at two Michigan parts
factories walked out two weeks ago, 21 of GM's North American
assembly plants have shut down, idling more than 80,000 workers.
Analysts say that if the strike is not settled soon it is likely to
last into mid-July, when a two-week plant shutdown was previously
scheduled. The strike, along with healthy spring sales, have caused
supplies of GM's cars and trucks, especially the most popular
models, to dwindle.
Inventories are particularly low of two all-new compact cars,
the Pontiac Grand Am/Oldsmobile Alero, that were just introduced;
of the Chevrolet Tahoe/GMC Yukon sport utilities, and of the
Chevrolet Malibu sedan. If the strike continues, it could interfere
with production of GM's most important models: all-new, full-size
Chevrolet and GMC pickups that replace the company's highly
profitable, best-selling vehicles.
WASHINGTON - An evening with Gov. George W. Bush was the hot
ticket in the nation's capital Thursday as he flew in for a
get-together with his family's longtime political supporters, a
two-event reunion expected to boost his campaign treasury by more
than $1 million.
Although the money was earmarked for his re-election bid, the
response from Washington lobbyists, Republican activists and
officials from his father's White House hampered Bush's efforts to
knock down talk of his being a contender for the presidency in
2000.
Responses to an invitation to dine with the governor over corn
chowder and beef medallions was so great that the $5,000-a-person
event had to be moved to a hotel from the home of Joseph
Gildenhorn, who was ambassador to Switzerland under the governor's
father, former President George Bush.
On Wednesday, the guest list for the reception at the swank
Willard Hotel was barely more than 500. By the time the governor
arrived in town, more than 800 were ponying up $500 for cocktails
and hors d'ouvres.
Before arriving in Washington, Bush was one of the key draws at
a fund-raiser Thursday in Greensboro, N.C., for Sen. Lauch
Faircloth. Bush also has helped raise money for gubernatorial
candidates in California and Ohio, for the Republican National
Committee and the Republican Governors Association. He also
participated in an Arizona fund-raiser for Sen. John McCain.
By the time formal invitations were printed, 156 people had
signed up as hosts or chairmen of the reception and 52 were helping
to put on the dinner along with Gildenhorn.
The money Bush raised Thursday is expected to push his campaign
treasury past the $16 million mark, which gives him a huge edge
over Democratic rival Garry Mauro. The latest figures available
indicate Mauro, the state land commissioner, has raised $2.5
million.
