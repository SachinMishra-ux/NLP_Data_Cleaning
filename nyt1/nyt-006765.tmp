As FBI agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian
Anderson take a smooth step up from television to the big screen.
The script tweaks their patented deadpan style without veering into
camp. As for those Internet rumors of romance, the movie handles
the characters' celebrated sexual tension with a scene that's the
equivalent of a knowing wink.
You may wonder about logistics, for instance. How does Mulder
get so easily from D.C. to Antarctica when his every move is being
watched? You may also marvel at his knack for always choosing the
right direction during a chase and his luck at literally stumbling
into a secret entrance to a vast military site.
The film may seem too familiar to series fans, too confusing to
newcomers. A colleague who doesn't watch the show followed the plot
OK. But she was bothered that Mulder and Scully acted so surprised
by the conspiracy and alien elements. Haven't they been
investigating these things for five years? While she had a fine
time watching, nothing about the movie made her eager to tune into
the series.
Fans may get a headache from trying to match the film's
semi-explanation of things with the hints and snippets the series
has dropped. The movie does not tie up a lot of loose ends. After
all, the series is committed for another two years; creator Carter
isn't ready to knock down his own house of cards.
FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) Brilliant but
darkly obsessed agent who believes his sister, Samantha, was
abducted by aliens as a child. On his quest, he is uncovering
pieces of a far-reaching conspiracy involving an alien attempt to
colonize Earth and powerful men who are helping the aliens.
FBI Special Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) Mulder's
partner, who usually plays a scientific and rational role to his
intuitive, seat-of-the-pants style.
FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) Mulder
and Scully's boss, he's mainly a benevolent protector who looks out
for them, but sometimes tries to rein them in.
Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) Shadowy unnamed
figure who's somehow a key. Works for the Syndicate (see below) but
may have his own agenda.
The X-Files Secret FBI files on cases involving unexplained
phenomena (X unexplained). On the series, these can involve all
sorts of spooky stuff, including vampires, werewolves, telekinesis,
etc. The important ones are about aliens and are part of the core
mythology of the series.
The aliens There are believed to be at least two kinds, maybe
more. The bad aliens are attempting to colonize and enslave Earth
and use their life force, a black, oily substance, to take over
humans. They have been here for thousands of years, although it's
not clear yet what is taking so long. Some good aliens, who are
shape-shifters and can take human form, may be fighting the bad
aliens, but they are involved in the TV series, not the movie.
