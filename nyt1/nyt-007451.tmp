The world's forests have been under siege since the turn of the
century, but this year has been calamitous. In Canada, Brazil,
Mexico, Central America, Africa, and Indonesia, fires have
destroyed nearly 40 million forested acres, an area as large as New
York state. The easy explanation is El Nino, a perverse weather
system that has flooded some regions but left others bone dry. But
the main culprit, as always, is human activity, chiefly logging,
mining, and agriculture, which dries out the forest by stripping it
bare of trees, leaving even humid tropical rain forests vulnerable
to fire. For that reason, the fires are likely to reoccur, with or
without El Nino, unless something is done to curb mankind's
insatiable appetite for wood.
In that context, there was a small ray of hope in the
announcement last week that a small South American country,
Suriname, had decided to give permanent protection to four million
acres of untouched tropical forests, about one-tenth of the entire
country. Suriname reached its decision at the urging of
Conservation International, an American environmental group that
has set up a private trust fund to help Suriname manage the area.
The group became actively involved in Suriname several years ago,
when Asian timber interests having pretty much stripped their own
countries of marketable hardwoods sought timber rights on 11
million acres of Suriname's forests. Suriname rejected that deal,
and has now put four million of these acres out of reach.
What makes this decision so heartening is that Suriname is a
poor country that might normally have jumped at the quick profits
promised by foreign logging interests. Far richer nations like
Brazil have been unable to resist these blandishments, and Asian
timber interests are even now burrowing deeper into the Amazon rain
forest. At the other end of the economic scale, Guyana, Surname's
destitute neighbor, has opened up two-thirds of its forest mass to
foreign companies.
More than one-half of the world's original tropical forests have
now disappeared, mostly in this century. At present rates of
destruction, half of what is left could vanish in the next 50
years. This depressing prospect has not, however, inspired the
wealthier nations to act constructively. One of the few tangible
products of the 1992 Earth Summit was the Global Environmental
Facility, a multilateral body designed to persuade poor countries
to hang on to their natural assets, rain forests included. But the
United States, which pledged $435 million over five years, is $200
million in arrears.
The task of saving the forests has thus been left to private
conservation groups, whose resources are limited. The very fact
that one of these groups and one small country have joined to save
four million acres might shame Western governments into broader
action.
Church-goers in Woodville, Miss., likely will be hearing for
quite some time about their preacher stripping down to his shorts
and using his toes to maneuver a trophy largemouth bass into an
$18,000 bass tournament payout.
Whitaker literally caught a 12.7-pound bass by the tail to sail
into the winner's seat of the $450,000 Texas Outdoor Adventure
Series tournament, but not before having to use his toes and feet
to free his line, which the fish had wrapped around a stump in
about 14 feet of water.
It started when Whitaker cast a large tequila-colored plastic
worm into a stumpy area Saturday during the second day of the
three-day tournament. He felt the bass take the worm and set the
hook, only to have his line wrapped around a stump by the fish.
When he was unable to free it, he figured the only way he could get
to the fish would be to go in after it.
With Green holding onto Whitaker's boat, Whitaker stripped to
his shorts and went overboard, placing his line between his toes so
he could follow the line down to the fish.
Whitaker managed to loosen the line from the stump and got back
into his boat, but the ordeal was far from over. He suddenly
realized that the fish had wrapped the line around another stump.
So, he jumped back into the lake.
