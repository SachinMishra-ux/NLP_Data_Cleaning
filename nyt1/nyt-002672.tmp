Like Espada's decision, Seabrook's withdrawal from this year's
congressional race represents a major victory for Ramirez. With
Seabrook and Espada no longer candidates, the Bronx Democratic
organization will have little to no substantial opposition for its
incumbents.
Campaign finance reform has been declared dead many times by
Newt Gingrich and his eager pallbearers, only to rise again with
more support. But with the House set to open its long-deferred
debate on overhauling campaign finance laws, the speaker has come
up with another strategy to squelch reform in the form of a
parliamentary rule to allow hundreds of amendments. This sneaky
attempt to sow legislative chaos and run out the clock is another
abuse of power by the speaker. But advocates can win by standing up
to the Georgia obstructionist.
Gingrich's pattern of obstruction was first established last
fall. But a revolt by Republicans forced him to schedule a vote for
1998. When the time came to redeem that promise, Gingrich insulted
his colleagues by blocking consideration of the one bill that would
change the system, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays of
Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts. Only when the
Shays-Meehan supporters gathered enough signatures on a petition to
bring the bill to the floor did Gingrich relent. The lesson is that
if Republicans and Democrats raise a cry of protest, Gingrich will
back down.
Armey and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, will be in charge of
the trial-by-amendment scheme. Among their amendments are every
variety of poison-pill rider designed to repel Democratic votes.
Some of these measures might deserve to be considered on their
merits on another day. For now, their obvious purpose is to delay
Shays-Meehan and confuse the public.
Under the glare of publicity, the tactics of Gingrich and his
colleagues will be seen for what they are, a brazen attempt to
undermine the public demand for an end to the influence-peddling
that passes for campaign finance in America. Supporters of change
are close to having the votes. The speaker's desperate trickery
shows that he knows it. Now is the time for all lawmakers to stand
up and demonstrate that Congress answers to the public, not to
moneyed interests and a devious speaker.
FORT WORTH, Texas A Denton woman who spent three years
believing she had HIV is not entitled to monetary damages from the
physicians and medical laboratory involved in testing, diagnosing
and treating her for the disease, a Tarrant County jury concluded.
Jurors voted 11-1 in rejecting the negligence claims brought by
Khristol Watson, 29, against Dr. Muddamalle Augustine of Arlington,
Texas, Drs. Steven Sotman and Daniel Barbaro of Fort Worth, Texas,
and National Psychopharmacology Laboratories, a now-defunct
Tennessee company.
Watson, who was found to be HIV-positive in 1991, sued the
physicians and lab after discovering in 1994 that she is, in fact,
HIV-negative. She said she underwent a hysterectomy in 1993 largely
because she believed she was infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.
Her attorneys had asked for damages up to $38 million for pain
and suffering, lost earnings, medical expenses and mental anguish,
including Watson's distress at knowing she can no longer bear
children.
The verdict Friday, which ended a four-week trial, came on the
third day of jury deliberations in 348th District Court.
