Stewart's biggest break came at No. 17, where he hit a driver
into the first cut on the right-hand side. Figuring he could not
reach the green, Stewart opted to play a 2-iron out of the tall
grass and caught it flush. The ball rolled. And rolled. And rolled.
All the way to the front edge of the green, where Stewart
drained the 45-footer for birdie and began an impromptu funky
chicken dance in celebration.
He followed with his worst swing of the day, a misdirected
2-iron into the right rough. From there, Stewart dug out an 8-iron
that skirted the edge of the green before reaching pin-high and
turning toward the hole. It eventually stopped 12 feet above the
hole, and Stewart canned the ticklish putt for his final birdie of
the day.
Stewart's closest pursuer is Carnevale, a career journeyman who
has bounced between the PGA Tour and Nike Tour in recent seasons.
But the 38-year-old emerged as the only front-runner to finish 18
holes without a bogey in the opening round.
Carnevale, 38, hit 10 of 14 fairways and found 12 of 18 greens
in regulation. He one-putted nine greens, including three for
birdies.
CINCINNATI Don't try searching for some special formula to
explain the Diamondbacks' recent winning ways. There is no secret
method for success.
The biggest reason the Diamondbacks have won three in a row and
four of five begins and ends with their pitching rotation. Period.
You don't need to be some old baseball codger to know pitching
has been and always will be the difference between winning and
losing at this level. Everyone who has ever been associated with
baseball knows the game is all about pitching.
If you got it, you win. If you don't, you're the Florida
Marlins.
Andy Benes, Willie Blair, Brian Anderson and Omar Daal have
pitched about as well as their human bodies are capable in the last
week. Since beating St. Louis last Saturday, the four have combined
to produce an almost pea-sized ERA of 1.60 during the five-game
span.
