This year, after being set back by shoulder and elbow stiffness,
Wilson has finally progressed to the point where he can throw
batting practice, which he was scheduled to do for Todd Hundley
again Saturday.
Nah. It's just a part of that elusive quality that is commonly
known as chemistry. This isn't the kind of chemistry of elements
and periodic tables, or the kind of chemistry that results in
explosions when the wrong stuff is mixed together.
This is the kind of science that can have some influence on how
a sports team plays on the field.
Chemistry was cited as a major ingredient when the Rangers won
the West in 1996. Some of those players are gone, notably
designated hitter Mickey Tettleton, center fielder Darryl Hamilton
and third baseman Dean Palmer.
But the chemistry apparently remains with this team. And that
chemistry will be called upon as the Rangers try to battle back
into first after losing their division lead to the Anaheim Angels.
Team chemistry is kind of like the wind. Few can explain what it
is, or where it comes from, but you know when it's there and can
sense when it isn't.
Like H2O, which assumes the shape and color of what it's poured
into, chemistry takes on many forms.
Wetteland played on two teams with that kind of chemistry the
1994 Montreal Expos that had the best record in baseball when the
players went on strike and the '96 Yankees that won the World
Series.
But also important is the chemistry of getting along well in the
clubhouse, of blending 25 players of different ages and from
different backgrounds and cultures in order to perform on the
field.
Leaders such as Wetteland help make sure it happens. An example
is his complicated set of bullpen rules.
