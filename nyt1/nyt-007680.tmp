Monday night the battle resumes against teams capable of
offering even greater resistance, and more than just saving face
will be at stake. All because of the golden opportunities the Mets
turned into dust.
The United Automobile Workers' strike against General Motors in
Flint, Mich., is an indication of just how deep distrust can still
run in an industry where workers and management all too often have
seen each other as enemies whose every action is viewed with
hostility.
This strike began in that atmosphere. Each side believes the
other failed to live up to promises made more than a year ago. The
company says workers are refusing to implement agreements to
improve productivity, while the workers accuse management of not
making promised investments to improve the plant and fear
management secretly wants to move their jobs to Mexico or to
nonunion suppliers.
Neither side thinks it can rely on the word of the other, and
there is no sign that the strike, which began June 5, will end
soon. Workers and the company are suffering as the strike forces GM
to close most of its North American assembly lines.
For the workers themselves, there is no reason to fear losing
their jobs. The UAW's contract with GM guarantees that current
union workers can keep working until they retire. But GM's hourly
work force in America has been declining steadily with attrition,
and is now less than half the level of two decades ago. The workers
fear their children will not have the opportunities they had to get
well-paid auto-industry jobs.
With the American economy booming, GM is making money, a fact
that makes it harder for the company to plead necessity as it
pushes for higher productivity. But the world auto industry has
substantial overcapacity, and some kind of shakeout is probably
inevitable. For American plants to continue to compete in making
affordable cars, companies and workers must find a way to
cooperate. Ford and Chrysler have done a far better job of this
than has General Motors, which is enduring its 16th strike in five
years.
This strike will be settled at some point, and General Motors
cars will again roll off the assembly lines. But if the two sides
do not find a way to change the atmosphere of distrust and
hostility, the chances of GM's regaining its competitive edge and
of being in a position to hire the children of current workers will not be good.
NEW YORK The first time that Kym Hampton took the ball to the
basket, determined to challenge the Utah Starzz's 7-foot-2-inch
center, Margo Dydek, Hampton admitted, she was as frightened and
curious to see the result as the 15,754 fans at Madison Square
Garden. 
Giving away a foot to Dydek and even Hampton's teammates are
skeptical of the 6-2 listed in her bio Hampton took the ball to
the basket and came away unscathed. Once that worked, she did it
again and again, scoring a career-high 22 points to help the
Liberty to a 68-64 victory. 
It worked three times for Hampton before Dydek blocked one of
her shots, which was enough to lift the confidence of the center
and allow her to believe Coach Nancy Darsch's insistence that she
play more aggressively. Hampton greeted the coach's advice with a
willing spirit but a dubious mind, facing the Women's National
Basketball Association's version of Wilt Chamberlain, although
Dydek's game may be more similar to Shawn Bradley's.
