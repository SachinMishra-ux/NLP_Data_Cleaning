After the oil embargo is lifted, Iraq will fall under a
long-term monitoring system rather than active, intrusive
disarmament inspections with orders to search and destroy. Although
the surveillance system set up in Iraq by the Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM, would continue to operate though perhaps in a
different form inspectors are concerned that without direct
Security Council oversight, Iraq will whittle down controls and
find it easier to defy requests for cooperation.
Aziz refused to address the question of missing rocket fuel,
saying it could be dealt with later under long-term monitoring. He
said that accounting for missile engines and guidance systems was
not necessary at this point.
ARLINGTON, Texas The Oakland Athletics left 15 runners on
base. They loaded the bases in three innings and failed to score
each time.
That freak play, with two runs scoring on a wild-pitch
strikeout, and tough pitching in clutch situations allowed the
Rangers to salvage the final game of a disappointing homestand with
a 3-2 victory against the Athletics yesterday at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
The hard-fought victory, played in 3 hours, 20 minutes in
99-degree heat and a whipping prairie wind, left the Rangers 2-5 on
the homestand. They open a three-game series with the
division-leading Anaheim Angels tonight on the West Coast.
Six Rangers pitchers combined to allow nine hits, eight walks
and one hit batter but limited the Athletics to 3-for-11 hitting
with runners in scoring position. They didn't retire the side in
order until John Wetteland did so in the ninth to earn his 20th
save.
Rangers starter Aaron Sele issued a career-high seven walks but
battled through 6 2/3 innings to get the victory, his 10th of the
year against four losses. It's the earliest a Rangers pitcher has
won his 10th game in a season, and it ties him with Atlanta's Greg
Maddux for the major-league lead.
Oakland starter Tom Candiotti, throwing a mean knuckleball, was
just as tough in clutch situations. Actually, he was too tough on
the key play of the game, both for Clark and Oakland rookie catcher
A.J. Hinch.
It might have made a difference that Candiotti tangled with
home-plate umpire Ted Barrett while retrieving the dropped throw,
because Greer barely slid in under Hinch's tag.
Sele and the bullpen made that play hold up. The Athletics put
together three hits in the fourth to make it 3-2 but couldn't pull
even despite having nine base runners in the final five innings.
