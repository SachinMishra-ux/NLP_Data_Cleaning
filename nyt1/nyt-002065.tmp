When I finished adding Hummingbird, I wanted more beautiful,
carefree garden workhorses like it in my small spaces. That meant I
had to explore mail-order catalogs because most of these plants
have yet to reach garden centers.
One of my first searches was for Rhodora (Rhododendron
canadense). Among the most cold-tolerant of the genus, this
deciduous plant had been recommended to me for its ease of care by
an officer of the American Rhododendron Society.
Thriving in either sun or shade, Rhodora bursts forth with large
rosy purple or white flowers in early spring. In fall, the foliage
turns a rather attractive yellow-brown. Though most literature says
Rhodora must be grown in moist conditions (it is native to bogs and
wet hillsides), my plant is in a raised bed and requires only a
weekly watering during dry spells.
To be honest, the dogwood stems were not as colorful over the
winter as I had hoped, and I have read that the leaves are
susceptible to disease and early drop. If this is true, Kelseyi
will disappear from my garden. That will not be a disaster. Unlike
in trials with large bushes, mistakes in experimenting with smaller
shrubs do not leave big, ugly spaces in borders.
NEW YORK Given all the 20th-century icons who have been
resurrected and paid homage to in the name of fashion, nothing is
more curious than the pedestal erected for that hapless bungler of
television fame Gilligan.
Then again, Gilligan is the apotheosis of simple chic compared
with those other castaways the movie star, the millionaire and
his wife who packed an astounding amount of clothes for a
three-hour tour. And Gilligan had the right idea: in tropical
weather, a hat protects the head and neck from the sun.
Moreover, given the natural impulse to dress down for summer in
a lightweight jacket, polo shirt and khakis, a good hat adds a
crucial bit of personality and polish to an otherwise lackluster
outfit.
Even so, there is no reason the Gilligan hat has to go into
reruns this summer. Even if one does not want to step out in a
dandified straw boater, there are any number of summer hats less
dowdy than our hero's.
At Barneys New York, a jaunty black straw hat made in England by
Fred Bare, $60, is neat and crisp enough to wear with a suit, yet
equally apropos of a short-sleeve shirt and shorts.
A black striped straw hat by Rod Keenan, $265, also at Barneys,
is less versatile but much more stylish. Made of a finer weave, it
is also more comfortable and durable.
