Transfer tenderloins to the grill, arranging them so that thick
end is over hottest part of fire. Grill, uncovered on high heat,
for 3 minutes, rolling pork on all sides. Move the pork to medium
heat, continue turning and complete grilling as indicated:
Thin tenderloins (about 1 1/2 inches in diameter) need an
additional 10 to 12 minutes on medium and thick ones (about 2 1/2
inches in diameter) require up to 25 minutes. The meat is done when
the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees to 160 degrees.
WACO, Texas When blond-haired, blue-eyed Grand Dragon Michael
Lowe, backed by several dozen of his Texas Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan followers, shows up in the strife-torn East Texas community of
Jasper with a message of peace and harmony, don't believe it.
It would be best if no one showed up at the June 27 KKK rally on
Jasper's courthouse steps because Grand Dragon Lowe is the Klan's
Lowe is a successful recruiter for the Klan because he keeps the
hoods and sheets in the closet and preaches a message that could
substitute for the political platform of many current politicians.
Like the rest of America, Lowe's attention must have riveted on
the small timber community of Jasper following reports that three
white men chained the feet of Jasper native James Byrd Jr. to the
trailer hitch of a beat-up old pickup and dragged the 49-year-old
African-American down country roads until his body was torn to
pieces.
The three white ex-cons arrested for the murder were reported to
have links to racist prison gangs. Add racial hatred as the
apparent motive for the ghastly crime and Lowe must have felt the
thrill of a once-in-a lifetime opportunity.
When Lowe isn't busy putting a mainstream happy face on the
Klan, he works as a carpenter in the Waco area. He grew up and
still lives in nearby Robinson where high school classmates
remember him as a misfit who had a well-developed hatred for blacks
at an early age.
A chilling peek into Lowe's young psyche that reverberates with
the Jasper murder was reported in an Aug. 14, 1994, Tribune-Herald
article about Lowe by staff writer Teresa Talerico.
Lowe erupted when a black student was nominated as class
favorite, according to a classmate who graduated with Lowe in 1968.
