The Dow Jones industrial average, after weeks of sluggish
trading, rose 167.15 points, or 1.88 percent, to close at 9,037.71,
its biggest surge in four months.
The gains in blue-chip issues created a broad two-day rally in
equity prices, and even lifted bond prices, after two days of
government reports portrayed an economy that was revving on all
cylinders.
The reports, one on Thursday which said that factory orders,
productivity and retail sales were rising, and another Friday that
showed strong job growth with little inflationary pressure, set off
a buying spree on Wall Street, particularly in blue-chip stocks.
The Standard Poor's 500-stock index soared 19.03 points, or
1.74 percent, to close at 1,113.86 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite gained 12.97 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to
1,782.92.
Wall Street analysts said the reports suggested that the
domestic economy may be resilient enough to withstand the festering
economic crisis in Asia, which dented investor sentiment last
October, and that a slowdown in corporate profit growth at home may
soon reverse course.
In recent weeks, though, weakening profit growth and high
valuations had largely sapped enthusiasm for stocks, punishing
scores of technology shares, and knocking 4.4 percent off the Dow's
all-time high of 9,211.84, set in May.
But again and again in this bull market, investors have been
warmed by a steady stream of government reports about an economy
that has managed to steer a deft middle ground between economic
might and slackening growth.
That outlook which many skeptics have long cast doubt on seemed to be hinted at in Friday's government report, which managed
to cheer both stock and bond investors. Stock investors because it
seemed to portend solid profits; bond investors because they did
not see inflation accelerating in the jobs data.
As a result, while the Dow soared in early trading, bond prices
also rose. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed half a
point, pushing down its benchmark yield to 5.78 percent from 5.82 a
day earlier, the lowest close since early January, meaning that
long-term interest rates are once again near a 25-year low. (Bond
prices and their yields move in opposite directions.)
That enthusiastic combination fed on itself throughout the day.
Investors, tentative since early April, went back to their favorite
big, blue-chip issues, such as Walt Disney, Merck and IBM.
