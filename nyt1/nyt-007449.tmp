NEW YORK When the Atlanta Braves roar into Yankee Stadium for
the highly anticipated interleague match between the top teams in
the National and American Leagues Monday night, much may be made of
what the Braves have yet to fix since losing to the Yankees in the
1996 World Series.
The Braves' bullpen has not seemed the same since Jim Leyritz
demystified the Braves' stopper, Mark Wohlers, with one mighty
three-run home run in the '96 Series.
Wohlers, who was on the disabled list last month, has pitched
poorly since coming back, allowing six hits, nine walks and seven
runs in six and two-thirds innings. The struggles were so obvious
that the Braves sent the pitcher to the minors on Friday so he
could work on mechanics with a pitching coach. That leaves the
closer's duties in the hands of the 43-year-old Dennis Martinez,
who has two of the Braves' relatively small total of 17 saves.
But don't expect the Yankees or any team trying to measure its
worth against the Braves to fixate solely on this flaw. Not when
the Braves, already strong because of their starting pitching, have
adroitly filled other holes. Indeed, the Braves come to town
potentially tougher than they were a year ago when they won two of
three games in interleague play against the Yankees.
The Braves' 49-24 record as of Saturday afternoon and .671
winning percentage are second in the major leagues to the Yankees'
marks of 49-17, .742.
The Braves' starters are omnipresent and as effective as ever,
with three consecutive complete-game victories by the rookie Kevin
Millwood, Denny Neagle and the incomparable Greg Maddux in the last
week alone.
For once, though, the starting pitching isn't necessarily the
primary weapon. At least not since Andres Galarraga came on board
and established himself as perhaps the most profitable pickup of
the off-season, as well as a player capable of transforming an
entire offense.
Galarraga, a former Colorado Rockie turned free-agent
acquisition, has spent the season not only bashing the baseball,
but also shattering the notions that he is an over-the-hill player
incapable of compiling big numbers without the aid of the thin air
of mile-high Denver.
Galarraga, 37, who was refused three guaranteed years by the
Rockies, found a home in Atlanta. The first-base replacement for
Fred McGriff has driven in 67 runs, strong evidence that Galarraga
remains more than capable of driving in 145 runs, his average the
last two seasons.
Then there are the home runs. Galarraga has lost nothing in the
transition from high altitude to sea level. Rather, he is making
Turner Field look as cozy as Coors Field, peppering a stadium that
was initially thought to favor pitchers with 11 of his 25 home
runs, all but one farther than 400 feet.
