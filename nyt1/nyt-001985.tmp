On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
