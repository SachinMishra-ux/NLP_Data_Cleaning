Nomo then held the Marlins scoreless until the sixth, when
Counsell led off with a full-count walk and Hernandez singled him
to second after having fouled off two consecutive bunt attempts. On
came Brian Bohanon, who ended up throwing a wild pitch to enable
Counsell to score the go-ahead run.
The Marlins added two more runs in the seventh, although the
Mets cut down another run at the plate on a Matt Franco-to-Rey
Ordonez-to-Mike Piazza relay that began at the left-field fence.
Then Mel Rojas, who is in as bad a funk as anyone, gave up a pair
of runs in the eighth, raising still more questions about a bullpen
that does not have a right-handed reliever the Mets can depend on.
When it was over, the Mets were left wondering if it is a slump
or something more. Is it any wonder that Ruben Sierra was signed to
a look-and-see minor league contract Saturday? Even with Piazza,
these Mets have no punch especially in their outfield. And when
the pitching is not there and it was not there Saturday the
Mets are in trouble.
Nomo is now 2-8 with a 4.95 earned run average. As a Met, he is
0-1 with a 4.50 e.r.a. He allowed 7 hits Saturday in his 97 pitches
and has now allowed 73 hits in 832/3 innings. Most distressing this
season has been the walks, 50 of them in all, an average of 5.4 per
game.
Not only are more men buying more ties this year -- menswear
sales are up 6.7 percent nationwide -- but there's a return to the
power tie, which we last saw in the mid-'80s. Then it was a
pale-yellow silk print, and now it's a woven, 18-karat-gold-colored
design reflecting the renewed interest in luxury goods.
But ties, like hemlines, are only a gauge, and the world's
excitement over the end of the millennium has thrown market
watchers a curve.
He said the colored shirt with matching solid-color tie that was
so hot last year fueled the fire. But soda-pop colors like lime,
lavender and pale orange are cooling off, and deep jewel tones in
classic stripes and small prints -- still paired with blue or
earth-toned dress shirts -- are the big news now.
She attributed the overall trend to Kaiser's new management,
which has created a new-found pride in the workplace.
Power ties at Rocketdyne Propulsion Power in suburban Canoga
Park, which is now affiliated with Boeing, are also glowing in
gold, but shades of red still mean business, said company spokesman
Dan Beck. He was quick to add that Rocketdyne is not exactly a
tie-wearing company, but he wears one, and favors woven styles with
a '40s flavor.
Since it's a relatively casual atmosphere, anybody wearing his
best suit and power tie would make people suspicious that he had a
job interview at lunch, Beck added.
