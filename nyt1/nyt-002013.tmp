It could happen. And it could be a giant ball of chocolate, such
as Nestle's new Armageddon Asteroid, a hollow chocolate ball filled
with tangy red and black meteorites.
SHE'S BAAACK: It's happy news for Nancy Drew fans. The mystery
series most girls grew up with is back in its original form, with
the same book jackets used in the '30s when the series made its
debut. Remember those early books, when the fictional teen-age
detective was a blonde instead of titian-haired and carried an
electric torch instead of a flashlight? Miz Hot Tips used to spend
her entire allowance on the mysteries each week, so she was
thrilled to spot them in bookstores again, now priced at $12.95.
And there's a bonus. The new collector's editions have nostalgic
introductions by contemporary mystery writers, including Sara
Paretsky.
BEAUTY BUZZ: Hot off the fax machine is news that the Gap has
its own line of sunscreens. ... Sebastian now makes a swimmer's
shampoo called Performance Active that gets rid of chlorine. ...
Nordstrom now carries e-nail, a cool product for trendies like Drew
Barrymore and Jewel that looks like a CD and has tiny frog princes
and other cutsey decals for summer manicures. And speaking of
Barrymore, the young actress has designed a line of tank tops available at Planet Hollywood stores to support Wildlife
Waystation.
PET PATROL: This is Pet Appreciation Week, and that means
pay-back time for all the love and loyalty your furry or feathered
friend has given you. So don't forget a catnip mouse, a new ball or
a fresh seed treat, but do forget (at least this week) about those
shredded draperies, carpet accidents and other pet mishaps.
If you have a dog that loves to go for runs with you, consider
the pet first aid kit developed by the Los Angeles chapter of the
American Red Cross. You can get the kit for $35 at local Red Cross
offices or by calling (213) 739-5289.
What we've got here is a triangle, and the underrated Viggo
Mortensen, as the artist who's romancing the married woman, is more
than adequate to the task of holding up his quota of the venality
and danger hemming Paltrow's anxious woman in. The screenplay is
smart enough to make sure Paltrow is handed more than a victim
role. Still, it amounts to a square-off between Douglas's raging
but outwardly controlled husband and Mortensen's smooth barbarian
at the gates. The trouble at home is exacerbated by the
wheeler-dealer's business troubles. His wife's trust fund, in fact,
would help him cover some reckless financial overextensions.
So the plot is hatched. Douglas, using moral outrage like a
baton, suggests Gordon Gekko under pressure, who has perhaps lost a
little off his fastball. In this film where everybody has at least
one guilty secret and nobody's hands are clean, Douglas projects
instincts as basic as any. Getting the edge on the painter by
looking into the latter's past, he blackmails him into murdering
his wife, sets up the killing, and retreats into an airtight alibi
at his club. Naturally, the murder doesn't go as planned. That's
when the improvisation and the guignol-based entertainment begins, enlivened by glimpses of a multi-culti New York,
personified by Sarita Choudhury's pal to Paltrow at the United
Nations, where both work as translators, and by David Suchet's
Arabic-American cop, as unnervingly competent-seeming as the sleuth
Suchet plays on TV, Hercule Poirot.
Without giving anything away, it can be said that the film ends
with a death, and involves a couple more along the way. They're
staged for shock value, and achieve it. The film works as a series
of skilled and cynical hammerstrokes executed in a pervasive
darkness that makes the route between Wall Street and the Upper
East Side seem a tunnel to hell.
Douglas is, as usual, all fire and ice, clenched and furious.
Paltrow becomes interesting when she abandons her usual air of cool
self-possession and allows her features to blur with the stress
she's feeling as she simmers in her bad choice of men. Mortensen
holds the screen against them both as the far from romantic
psychopath, whose role is expanded most beyond the original, and
who takes it to career-propelling realms of silken creepiness.
For years, the Oregon couple known in cyberspace as Hubby and
Wifey had a little secret they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
