But Grier refused to join a group touring the now-closed hotel,
a somewhat surreal journey that climaxed with Los Angeles
Councilman Nate Holden speaking hopefully about racial unity in the
pantry where Kennedy was slain.
Joseph Cerrell, a Los Angeles political consultant who was
working in his Ambassador Hotel-based office on June 5, 1968,

EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, Mo. A lot of American workers go to work
knowing exactly what they're earning a set amount for each hour,
each week or each month. They know it. They plan on it. And they
grouse about it.
So what happens when the rank and file are paid like CEOs? No,
not the same amount. In the same profit-based way. If the company
does well, everybody's paycheck increases. Everybody's.
Larry Sternberg is going to find out whether the concept works.
When The Elms Resort and Spa reopens this summer in Excelsior
Springs, general manager Sternberg will have every employee on an
incentive pay plan. Each month's paychecks will reflect the
strength of corporate performance the month before.
Yes, he's guaranteeing base pay. But, frankly, that minimum is
likely to be below what employees could earn elsewhere in the
hospitality industry.
The hospitality industry is seasonal. In lean months, paychecks
will be smaller, though Sternberg said he wouldn't cut into the
guaranteed base pay. In profitable months, paychecks will be
larger. The vagaries will require better budgeting by all workers.
Some applicants aren't willing to take the chance. Others are
willing to give it a try. Those are the workers Sternberg wants the people who will work hard to help the entire operation prosper,
not just because their own paychecks will benefit.
Sternberg prefers to think of the profit-distribution plan as an
incentive program rather than a pay program. The goal, he said, is
for all employees to come to work each day thinking about what they
can do to maximize company profits, which, of course, is done by
satisfying customers, saving operating costs and performing
productively.
Sternberg is confident he'll prove the naysayers wrong. He
figures this kind of incentive plan is at the heart of
entrepreneurism, where people work hard because of financial
self-interest.
