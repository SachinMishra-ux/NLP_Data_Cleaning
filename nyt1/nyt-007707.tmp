Even as relatives of the two men winced at how public the
couple's private lives had become, they agreed with Adolph
Galluccio, Michael's father, who said that the attention was
worthwhile if it helped other families to avoid alienation from
their gay children.
Along the way to adopting their son, Adam, who is now 3 years
old, they became accidental advocates with a monthly newsletter
sent to 500 subscribers, a World Wide Web page
(www.gaynj.net/galluccio/) and an agent who has booked speaking
engagements around the country.
Neary three years ago, the two men became the foster parents of
Adam. When they tried to adopt the boy formally, New Jersey child
welfare officials assented, as long as they did it separately in
two distinct and costly legal procedures. Under New Jersey law,
same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual couples had no legal
standing that would allow them to adopt jointly.
The couple challenged the law in court. Last October, Judge
Sybil Moses of Superior Court in Bergen County granted the joint
adoption, saying it was in the best interest of the child. Two
months later, all legal barriers to joint adoption by unmarried
same-sex and heterosexual couples were removed in a broader consent
decree. New Jersey became the first state to establish a policy
treating gay and unmarried couples the same way it treats married
couples regarding adoptions.
Only two states New Hampshire and Florida specifically bar
adoptions by gay couples. The recognition of Holden and Galluccio
as a family was seen by many as a step toward greater recognition
of gay unions.
After the consent decree in December, the calls began flooding
in, Galluccio and Holden-Galluccio said in an interview before
Sunday's ceremony. There were tearfully whispered encouragements
from frightened and closeted gay men and plaudits from gay high
school and college students who called the men heroes. The couple
said they started feeling responsible for people and stayed in the
public eye.
Holden-Galluccio said that the couple had been trying hard to
hold on to the spiritual and personal significance of Sunday's
ceremony amid the notoriety that had seized their lives. But the
personal and the spiritual kept intersecting with the public and
the political. The two men draped yellow-flowered leis around their
necks and those of the clergymen and women and family members. The
leis were gifts from Joe Melillo and Pat Lagon, two gay men in
Hawaii who have sued for the right to a legally recognized
marriage.
