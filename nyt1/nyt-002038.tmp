And last month, because of their work, the Department of
Veterans Affairs began planning a large, multicity study looking at
the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in Gulf War veterans.
The Nicolsons' theory of Gulf War illness has attracted fervent
supporters among some veterans and their families, and, until
recently, skepticism and even scorn from the military and many in
the scientific community.
In many of the soldiers, the mycoplasma appear to be genetically
engineered to include a gene from HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
Nicolson said. He believes that particular gene, called GP-120,
could make it easier for the mycoplasma to target cells important
to the immune system.
But the Nicolsons argue this infection hides deep in cells,
rather than floating free in blood. A test developed by Nancy
Nicolson, called nuclear gene tracking, coupled with a technique
called forensic polymerase chain reaction, sniffs out the genetic
code of the mycoplasma infection, they say.
Two civilian labs in California one private, another
associated with the University of California at Irvine have
reported finding high levels of mycoplasma in Gulf War vets, as
well as in civilian patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and
fibromyalgia, two other conditions with similar vague and multiple
symptoms.
It might have ended there, but Nicolson's claims were heard by
some members of Congress, particularly Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.,
and Rep. Norman D. Dicks, D-Wash.
At their urging, the Department of Defense agreed last year to
train researchers at four laboratories in the Nicolsons' precise
methods.
The researchers flew to Huntington Beach in January. The group
included Dr. Joel Baseman, an internationally recognized mycoplasma
expert and chairman of microbiology at the University of Texas
Health Science Center, and his staff.
Baseman said trying to identify the cause of Gulf War illness
seven years after the war is an extraordinary challenge particularly given the growing list of possible exposures soldiers
faced, such as chemical agents, sand storms, oil fires and anthrax
vaccines.
Mycoplasma are unique among infectious organisms. They are among
the smallest of bacteria, and are unusual in that they lack a cell
wall and depend on a host organism either plant or animal to
survive.
