We are fortunate enough to have this gift of love which is like
a precious plant. One just can't accept it, leave it, and think
it's going to grow by itself. Even after 50 years we must keep
watering it, to look after it, and nurture it. This I know we will
do.
I found Weeks' words in a note I opened last May as I sorted
through the hundreds of letters submitted in conjunction with our
annual Mother of the Year contest.
Weeks, 71, of Washington Twp. is an engineer who worked 46 years
for NCR in Dayton before he retired in 1989.
To his day , June 5, 1998, is the 50th anniversary of the
marriage of Don Weeks, and his wife, Virginia, who is 70. So this
is an appropriate day to put a spotlight on them.
Mrs. Weeks said she is not at all surprised that her husband's
words are imaginative, sensitive and somewhat poetic.
The Weeks have two grown children, both married. A daughter in
Beavercreek has two children and their son in Canada has four
children , the youngest of them 13-year-old twins .
The family plans to have a reunion in July to celebrate the
Weeks' 50th anniversary. But Don also plans to take his bride to
dinner. He said he plans to read some thoughts to her, doing it
quietly so other diners won't be disturbed.
I love you: For being a terrific wife and a wonderful mother
when it hasn't been easy. For helping, supporting, and taking care
of me when such was sorely needed. For creating and keeping an
immaculate, warm and cheerful home. And for the fanatistic life we
have had.
He plans to close out with the sentiment, Virginia, I pray we
have many more happy years together. It is with these thoughts I
extend my love to you, on this, one of the greatest days of my
life. Happy 50th Wedding Anniversary. With all my love, Don.

his childhood.
