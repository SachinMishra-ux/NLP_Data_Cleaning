Stewart's closest pursuer is Carnevale, a career journeyman who
has bounced between the PGA Tour and Nike Tour in recent seasons.
But the 38-year-old emerged as the only front-runner to finish 18
holes without a bogey in the opening round.
Carnevale, 38, hit 10 of 14 fairways and found 12 of 18 greens
in regulation. He one-putted nine greens, including three for
birdies.
WASHINGTON The federal grand jury investigating the
relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky on
Thursday heard from the lawyer who had helped prepare her statement
in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
The testimony by the lawyer, Francis Carter, has been sought
from the outset of the inquiry by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr. Carter helped prepare an affidavit on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf
in the lawsuit by Mrs. Jones, in which Ms. Lewinsky denied under
oath that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
Ms. Lewinsky was referred to Carter by Vernon Jordan, a close
friend of the president. Jordan has said that he took Ms. Lewinsky
to see Carter at about the time he was helping to arrange a job for
her. At the time, she faced a subpoena in the sexual harassment
lawsuit brought by Mrs. Jones against Clinton.
But later on Thursday, in an interview with The Washington Post,
Carter depicted himself as a lawyer who had been kept in the dark
by his client, Ms. Lewinsky, about several important details. Ms.
Lewinsky did not tell him that she had received gifts from Clinton,
or that Jordan was even then trying to help her find a job, The
Post quoted Carter as saying.
Jordan has said he tried to assist Ms. Lewinsky at the request
of Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie. Starr is known to be
investigating whether the job aid from Jordan was part of an
illegal scheme to keep Ms. Lewinsky quiet about a possible affair
with Clinton while the Jones lawsuit was still pending.
Although Ms. Lewinsky had denied a sexual relationship with the
president in the Jones affidavit, Ms. Lewinsky's second set of
lawyers had proposed as part of secret immunity talks with
prosecutors that she would be willing to testify that she did have
sex with Clinton, lawyers involved in those talks said.
But no evidence has surfaced to indicate that Carter did
anything improper in helping Ms. Lewinsky prepare her original
affidavit.
Carter's appeared before the grand jury on Thursday after losing
a court fight over whether his conversations with Ms. Lewinsky were
protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
