Big fleets, while they take great pains to hide their assets,
will sometimes pay fair settlements under sufficient legal
pressure. But a cabby who has mortgaged everything he has to buy a
medallion most of Lin's $30,000 down payment, for example, was
scraped up from friends and relatives, while the rest of the money
was borrowed from a lender has nothing to offer.
It costs them money, for one. The new insurance minimums $100,000 in liability coverage rather than $25,000, and $200,000 to
cover medical bills rather than $100,000 are expected to increase
owner-drivers' premiums, now typically $3,100 a year, to $6,000 or
more. The new penalty schedule, which raises fines several hundred
percent for infractions from smoking to speeding, can also cause a
driver to lose his license after only two tickets.
But it is the requirement that every medallion owner set aside
$100,000 in a bond which accident victims can collect if they get
judgments in excess of insurance coverage that worries drivers
the most.
Taxi industry leaders, who filed suit on Friday to overturn the
new rules, have asked the commission to consider alternatives to
the bond, like requiring owners to contribute to a pool of money to
compensate people with the most devastating injuries.
When asked whether independent owners whose medallions were
already mortgaged to the hilt might find it impossible to come up
with another $100,000, Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that many of them
were financing their medallions by choice, not by necessity.
Neil Greenbaum, a lender and broker who said he financed more
than 100 of the new medallion purchases, scoffed at her assertion.
Ms. McGrath-McKechnie said that in any case, a driver who
stretched himself paper-thin to buy a medallion was not acting
responsibly.
But Greenbaum noted that the commission, in promoting the
medallion auction, held seminars for bankers to encourage them to
lend money to medallion buyers.
Until he surged to the lead on the turn for home at Hollywood
Park and held off Deputy Commander by two lengths, he was the best
horse who'd never won a stakes race.
Mud Route, ridden and trained by Hall of Famers Chris McCarron
and Ron McAnally, was an early West Coast favorite for the 1997
Kentucky Derby after swift maiden and allowance victories but
shin problems sidelined him until fall. At Santa Anita this winter,
the colt twice finished second to '97 Derby winner Silver Charm.
