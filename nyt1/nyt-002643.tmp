If Detroit has a weak link, it is Osgood, but his supporting
cast is too strong to fail as a group. Nicklas Lidstrom leads the
attacking defensemen. Slava Fetisov, Larry Murphy, Bob Rouse and
Jamie Macoun fill out an aging but steady blue-line crew. Among the
best two-way wing men, Darren McCarty and Martin Lapointe hit first
and score second.
At the high end, Fedorov is the most skilled, although Steve
Yzerman leads the team in points with 20. Fedorov, Yzerman and Igor
Larionov are among the sport's most complete centers.
Should the Wings win the Cup it would be Bowman's eighth, tying
him with his mentor, Toe Blake. Absent a monumental upset, it will
be rings for the Wings. 
ELMONT, N.Y. For the second year in a row, the business of
horse racing was saved by, of all things, a horse and a race. Not
by a marketing plan or an advertising campaign or a creative
department.
The horse was Real Quiet, the race was the Belmont Stakes, the
plot was high drama: would Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness, also win the Belmont Stakes and become the 12th
horse in history to win the Triple Crown? Or would he become the
14th horse to lose on the lip of history?
To watch the drama unfold, a crowd of 80,162 went to Belmont
Park on a brilliantly sunny afternoon. It was the second largest
crowd to watch a race at Belmont and the largest in 27 years, since
Canonero II tried (and failed) to complete his Triple Crown sweep
before 82,694. And the multitudes on Saturday saw a classic race:
Real Quiet opening a four-length lead in the homestretch but, with
his Triple Crown within reach, struggling to withstand his
weariness and his challenger, Victory Gallop, who streaked up
alongside him for one more duel.
You could not have scripted it any better. In the Kentucky
Derby, it was Real Quiet by half a length over Victory Gallop. In
the Preakness, by 2\ lengths. And now, it was Victory Gallop
reversing recent history and winning the Belmont by one bob of the
head.
Smith was there Saturday with the 80,162 fans who saw the race
of their lives. They even bet large amounts of money: $9.3 million
at Belmont Park, the second largest amount ever recorded there, and
$55 million from all sources, far and near, the most since last
year's Belmont Stakes.
This is far-fetched and, worse, it takes racing on the low road
to salvation. Maybe there is no high road to reach gamblers, but
maybe that's questionable, too. Why make your pitch to common
gamblers when you're trying to rescue a sport from extinction?
Nobody sensed the true meaning of Belmont Day better than James
Bond, the trainer of Raffie's Majesty, who finished fifth while the
stars of the cast were staging their memorable duel.
