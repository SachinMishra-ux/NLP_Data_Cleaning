Rising to prominence as a supply-side economist during the
Reagan presidency, Gilder is an unabashed critic of federal
intervention in capitalism. For instance, he lambasted the recent
lawsuits by the U.S. Justice Department against software giant
Microsoft and by the Federal Trade Commission against chip maker
Intel.
The team was hoping to exceed the largest previous study, which
looked at 400 people, Cooper said. But it was overwhelmed by the
response.
Of the respondents to the poll, roughly 8 percent could be
qualified as cybersex compulsives, using sexual sites more than 10
hours a week and reporting that their use distressed them or
interfered with their relationships. Cooper said 3 percent to 6
percent of the general population engages in compulsive sexual
behavior.
Cooper cited in his report statistics gathered by Relevant
Knowledge, a Web traffic-tracking company, that found 9.6 million
users, or 15 percent of all Web users, logged on to the 10 most
popular sexual sites in April.
For people predisposed to sexual compulsivity, the accessibility
and anonymity of the Internet can make it easier to fall into
destructive behavior, he said.
But those same traits of cyberspace may help people feel more
comfortable exploring erotic pursuits there. That may be why a
growing number of women are turning to sexy Internet sites, Cooper
speculated.
The researchers acknowledged that their respondents were
self-selected, not a random sample, and all were MSNBC users, whom
Cooper characterized as more professionally successful and affluent
than average Internet users. But because of the size of the survey,
he said, he believes it provides a valuable snapshot of people who
go on-line for sexual pursuits.
While corporations and government agencies are spending tens of
billions of dollars to solve the problem, investors still do not
know if those organizations are devoting enough time and resources
to fix the potential computer bug before Jan. 1, 2000.
Bennett announced at the hearing that he has introduced
legislation that would require companies to make specific
disclosures about what they have done to solve the problem and what
work they have left to do.
Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
