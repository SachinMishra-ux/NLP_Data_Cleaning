Starr's position in the Foster privilege case is not a solitary
example of extremism. As independent counsel he has repeatedly
pressed at and beyond the edge of appropriate prosecutorial
behavior.
One tactic he uses is to call people before the grand jury again
and again. Betty Currie, President Clinton's secretary, is one
victim of that practice, which reeks of abuse.
Then there is the notorious treatment of Susan McDougal. After
she served 18 months in prison for civil contempt for refusing, she
says, to testify as Starr wanted, he paraded her in chains one more
time and had her indicted for criminal contempt.
Most troublesome of all is Starr's penchant for imagining, and
investigating, plots against his inquiry. A man who urged
prosecution of Linda Tripp for violating Maryland law when she
tape-recorded her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky was
called before Starr's grand jury. So was a Pentagon official, to be
questioned about the disclosure that Ms. Tripp had omitted from a
Pentagon security form the fact that she was once arrested for
grand larceny.
Anyone who resists Starr's overreaching is likely to be
denounced for delaying the investigation or obstructing justice.
Too much of the press voices such criticism, unable to see the
dangers of a prosecutor with no restraints of time or money.
Starr wants to win: to bring down President Clinton. That
obsession led him last week to the folly of telling the Supreme
Court that the country urgently needed expedited review of another
of his cases: a threadbare claim. The court, one institution that
does not dance to his tune, said no.
The point, now as in the McCarthy days, is to remember the
larger interest: our interest in liberty and privacy. It is not
just Bill Clinton who will lose if Kenneth Starr truncates the
lawyer-client privilege. We all will.
WASHINGTON When Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida sued the tobacco
industry in early 1995, he ignited a legal and political war that
raged for the next three years. During the course of the lawsuit to
recoup smoking-related health costs, which culminated in an $11.3
billion settlement last summer, tobacco interests poured more than
$1 million into the state, most of it going to political opponents
of the governor, a Democrat.
Since 1995, the tobacco industry has contributed $592,000 to the
Florida Republican Party, more than twice what it gave to Florida
Democrats. The industry also sprinkled an additional $338,244 among
friendly state legislators and other Florida political groups, many
of whom opposed the state's lawsuit and tried unsuccessfully to
derail it.
Cigarette makers' heavy contributions in Florida are part of a
national mosaic, according to an analysis of state party financial
records conducted for The New York Times by the Campaign Study
Group, a private research firm. Since 1995, when many states joined
Florida in filing lawsuits against the tobacco industry, Republican
and Democratic state party central committees in 26 states,
including Florida, have received $1.8 million in donations from
tobacco interests.
