Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
