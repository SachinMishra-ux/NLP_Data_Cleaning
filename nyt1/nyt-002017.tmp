SEX-CONVERSATION (Undated) In corporate conference rooms, in
dentists' chairs and over dinner, the continuing news about both
Viagra and Monica Lewinsky appears to have accelerated a change in
the way many Americans speak about a subject that some would prefer
be barely spoken about at all. In recent months, the subject of sex
and the language of sex acts and sex organs have been nudged a few
inches closer to the conversationally commonplace. By Janny Scott.
WAR-CENTENIAL (Undated) Centennials usually call for a lot of
clanking celebration, a period souvenir or two and perhaps some
minor historical revisionism. The 1898 observation, now under way
in Spain, Cuba, the Philippines and the United States, is a tough
one. So much was set in motion that it is difficult to contemplate
how we got from there to here. By Timothy Egan. (1500 words)

RAC-BELMONT (New York) In Saturday's running of the Belmont
Stakes, Real Quiet will try to become the 12th winner of the Triple
Crown, an achievement that horse racing has been waiting 20 years
for. By Joseph Durso.
BOX-FIGHT-CANCELED (New York) Evander Holyfield's heavyweight
title fight against Henry Akinwande appears to be off after
Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B. This follows a female
fighter being disqualified because she was pregnant. If the card
goes off at all, Roberto Duran, the 47-year-old Panamanian, will be
the headliner. It all amounts to boxing's comedy of errors in a
sports facility that pledged to get back into the business.
