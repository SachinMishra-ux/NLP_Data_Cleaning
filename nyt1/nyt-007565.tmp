Tim Harden, aided by a gust of 4.9 meters per second, won in
9.88 with Brian Lewis second in 9.98.
UCLA sophomore Seilala Sua, the two time NCAA champion,
unleashed an effort of 204-2 on her sixth and final attempt to win
the women's discus.
Regina Jacobs, the seven-time national 1,500-meter champion, won
her first 5,000 title in 15:32.31. Jacobs, a 1981 graduate of the
Argyll Academy, now known as Campbell Hall, pulled away from Libbie
Hickman in the final quarter to win by more than eight seconds.
Mike Bibby has spent most of his life listening to guys in
striped shirts, knowing they always had the final word. But this
was different. This striped shirt was working at a Foot Locker in a
local mall and was bragging to some of Bibby's friends that he
could take Bibby in a game of one-on-one.
Bibby declined, figuring he had nothing to prove. But he finds
it a little humorous, and irritating, that everyone seems to be a
Mike Bibby expert these days.
It is the curse of the young and the talented that people look
intently for wrinkles on faces that are barely past the Clearasil
stage.
It is not familiar territory for Bibby, who has been a phenom
since his early teens, but it's not unexpected, either. The Los
Angeles Clippers are expected to pick Bibby with the first
selection in Wednesday's NBA draft, so the scrutiny of Bibby's
skills is inevitable.
The son of Henry Bibby, the former UCLA and NBA point guard,
Mike Bibby always has seemed destined for greatness. At Shadow
Mountain High School, he set state records for scoring, and the
Matadors won the state championship his senior season.
In his first game at Arizona, he scored 22 points against North
Carolina. He helped the Wildcats to a national championship in his
freshman season. He was a first-team All-American as a sophomore.
His decision to leave college two years early for the NBA looks
wise because even if the Clippers don't take him, he probably will
be among the top five picks.
