A four-game sweep would continue a trend. Since the New York
Rangers needed seven games to eliminate the Vancouver Canucks in
the 1994 finals, the next three championships have been four-game
minimums: the Devils over the Wings in 1995, Colorado over Florida
in 1996 and the Wings over the Flyers in 1997.
Should this season's final go seven games, the last would be on
June 23, after the official start of summer. Except for the
lockout-delayed season that ended on June 24, 1995, no Stanley Cup
final has ended later than June 14. Among the reasons for this long
season are the 16-day Olympic break in February, the four-day
All-Star Game break in January and the extra off days during the
playoffs to accommodate television. These and other factors have
resulted in dwindling ratings, poor ice and fan apathy in even some
of hockey's bedrock cities.
There is no lack of interest here. Cars, buildings and statues
are decorated in the red and white of the home team. Not since the
1950s have Detroiters enjoyed as much hockey success as the Wings
have had under coach Scotty Bowman, who took over in 1993.
The team is experienced and balanced with skilled scorers and
diligent checkers. In eliminating the regular-season champion
Dallas Stars in six games in Round 3, the Red Wings survived a big,
mean team that tried to intimidate them.
The Capitals are not as nasty, although the churlish threesome
of Dale Hunter, Chris Simon and Craig Berube provides a hint of the
Crash Line element that proved disconcerting to the Wings when they
were swept by the Devils three years ago.
The big hitter of the Capitals defense is Mark Tinordi, who has
had a few days to recover from the leg injury that slowed him at
the end of the previous round. The eternal Esa Tikkanen, a forward
who seems to show up with different playoff contenders every year,
also might help.
Tikkanen is especially valuable as a shadow checker, as he was
in the second round against Ottawa's Aleksei Yashin. He might cover
Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, who leads the league in post-season goals
with nine.
The Capitals get much of their offense from two lines: the
Collegians and the Europeans. The collegians are Adam Oates, Joe
Juneau and Brian Bellows. Both Oates and Juneau attended Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, although Bellows is not a college man. The
Europeans are Peter Bondra, Andrei Nikolishin and Richard Zednik.
Oates leads his team in playoff points with 14. A former Red
Wing, Oates is one of the league's most creative passers. The best
attacker of the defense is Sergei Gonchar, who has 7 goals in the
tournament.
In goal, Washington's Olaf Kolzig has the best goals-against
average: 1.69 a game. Detroit's goalie, Chris Osgood, is capable of
shutting out a team and also capable of squandering a lead or a tie
on a wishful shot from center ice. At this level, all goalies are
capable of shutouts, especially those who play for great teams. But
few give up two goals from center ice in the same spring. And
Osgood's clearing passes are frequently intercepted.
