This is a great musical, one that will continue to move
audiences for years.
The same goes for Taymor's staging of the wildebeest stampede, a
fanciful flight of birds throughout the theater and a magical
assembly of puppet creatures that forms into a stage-high image of
former lion king Mufasa's face. The Elton John-Tim Rice film score
has been bolstered with songs featuring African rhythms and
orchestrations. The design elements are wondrous. Still, the
production feels like it hops from effect to effect, only
occasionally touching the heart as the film did. Taymor's spectacle
inspires awe, but she doesn't have a story that can fully support
her stage wizardry.
Joe Masteroff retooled his script to make the homosexuality more
explicit, and Mendes tossed out some of the conventional musical
comedy numbers. But the revelation is how the Kit Kat Klub's Emcee
insinuates himself throughout the production as a wry observer, and
how lasciviously Alan Cumming redefines the creepy character.
The evening is his, though Natasha Richardson also brings new
dramatic qualities to naive songbird Sally Bowles, wallowing in
decadence and political denial. Her convulsive breakdown during the
title song is a nightmarish stunner. The ensemble, which sings,
dances, plays band instruments and fills various supporting roles,
is a show unto itself.
All of this is set in a theater converted into a Weimar cabaret,
but this environmental approach is the least important part of this
in-your-face production. It could easily be sacrificed if the show
tours, as road presenter and investor PACE Theatrical Group
intends. Meanwhile, life is likely to be a cabaret, old chum, for
the foreseeable future on Broadway.
Manipulative Mag Folan sits inert watching television, barking
orders to her plain, 40-year-old virginal daughter Maureen, the
ironically nicknamed title character. When gentleman caller Pato
Dooley wakes up romantic feelings in Maureen, proposing to her by
letter, Mag worries that she will lose her dutiful servant.
McDonagh and director Garry Hynes get delicious mileage from the
suspense over keeping the letter out of Mag's hands. Audience
sympathies ping-pong between Maureen and Mag, eventually tipped
when Mag dashes Maureen's chance for happiness. What follows is
both grisly and heart-rending.
Much of the play's original Irish cast came to New York, led by
Marie Mullen (Maureen), a wounded bird with highly expressive mood
swings. In the smaller, but showier role of Mag, Anna Manahan is a
wondrous and wily malevolent hulk. Also first rate is Tom Murphy as
Pato's glib younger brother Ray, misguidedly entrusted to deliver
the proposal letter.
Garber is dermatologist Serge, wealthy enough to plunk down a
small fortune for a white-on-white, I-coulda-done-that painting,
but insecure enough to need approval from his buddies. Judgmental
Marc (Alda) feels personally offended by the purchase, sending him
into jags of derisive laughter. Wishy-washy Yvan (Molina) tries to
mediate the situation to disastrous effect.
With its small cast, minimal set requirements and
audience-friendly comedy, Art could have a long future on Broadway,
before spreading throughout the country in regional theaters.
