Atlantic Richfield chairman and chief executive Mike Bowlin said
Thursday that it was more attractive to sell the whole stake in
that business. He said the money would be used to reduce debt
incurred from the acquisition of Union Texas Petroleum Holdings, an
independent oil company, which Atlantic Richfield agreed to buy
last month for $2.47 billion.
Atlantic Richfield has also begun an aggressive exploration
drive overseas to find new reserves of oil, since production at its
huge oil fields in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, has been falling.
The ARCO Chemical deal is the latest in a series of asset sales
by Atlantic Richfield. Last September the oil company sold the
remainder of its stake in Lyondell, and reached a deal to sell its
coal business to a New York investment firm last February.
Shares of ARCO Chemical surged on word of an impending deal,
first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. ARCO Chemical
finished at $57.0625 a share, up $6.50, or 12.9 percent. Lyondell
rose $1.25, to $29, while Atlantic Richfield fell $1.625, to
$78.8125.
Lyondell, based in Houston, had sales of $2.3 billion last year.
It makes basic chemicals such as ethylene and propylene, which are
used in a wide variety of consumer products.
ARCO Chemical, based in Newton Square, Pa., had sales of $4
billion last year. It is a major producer of propylene oxide, used
to make a range of products such as coolants, paints and cosmetics.
Frank Mitsch, an analyst of the chemical industry for Deutsche
Bank Securities, said the acquisition reflected shrewd timing by
Smith, since prices for chemical assets have been in a cyclical
decline and were likely to rise.
Lyondell has been seeking to cut costs and improve earnings by
entering into joint ventures with other chemical makers. In one
such venture last March, Lyondell joined Millennium Chemicals Inc.
to buy the petrochemical business from Occidental Petroleum Corp.
for $425 million.
The news Wednesday comes one day after Payless announced its
first positive quarter in a year and a half. It reported
second-quarter net income of $732,000, compared with a loss of
$13.2 million in the same period last year.
Barron takes over the positions once held by David Stanley,
former chief executive officer, and Susan Stanton, former
president. Stanley and Stanton left Payless in January shortly
after a new board was formed.
