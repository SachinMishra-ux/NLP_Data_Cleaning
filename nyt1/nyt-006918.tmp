The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
