However, not even a state-of-the-art drainage system can make it
dry any faster after a thunderstorm.
Truck qualifying for tonight's Pronto Auto Parts 400K was
delayed 31/2 hours when a storm front dumped half an inch of rain
on the track in the evening.
The revised schedule has the IRL cars practicing in two groups
from 1 to 1:30 p.m and 1:30 to 2 p.m. Qualifying under a
best-of-two-laps format is scheduled for 3 p.m.
Reigning Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever Jr. said he welcomed
the delay, because it gave his team an extra practice session.
It began to rain at TMS about 7:10 p.m., and rained for about a
half-hour. Drying crews got on the track about 8 p.m., and it took
more than two hours to get the track dry.
Before the rains came, there seemed to be plenty of evidence
that the track is faster since it was revamped.
Tony Stewart turned a hot lap of 223.224 in his Indy car, the
fastest ever at the speedway. The fast lap during the True Value
500k last year was 218.094 by Stewart.
Truck driver Bob Keselowski turned a hot lap of 177.597 in his
Dodge during the second practice session. Mike Bliss won the pole
last year with a lap of 175.667.
