Benedictine sisters began teach ing at the parish school 45
years ago. That's why the convent was built. Over the years, the
church and the school changed. There's only one Benedictine
teaching in the school, now. The convent houses 12 nuns, four of
them Benedictines and the rest from other orders. `CHOSE CONVENT LIFE' 
According to Ella Mae Bleier, a member of the parish council,
the growing church needs room to expand.
Plans originally had called for temporary buildings to be
installed for use next year by the school. In May, however, Father
Spaulding informed the nuns of a new idea. A house was available
for sale across the street and it was big enough, he said, to
accommodate the four Benedictine sisters. The convent would then be
converted to church use.
Since the other nuns aren't part of the order that first taught
at the school, parish officials say they have no obligation to
accommodate them.
Still, the pastor promised to help the other sisters. In the
meantime, the Benedictines decided not to live in the new house.
They also said no to having an upstairs portion of the parish
offices renovated specially for them. They did so partly because
the facilities didn't meet their needs and partly as a show of
solidarity.
In some Catholic dioceses, nuns being displaced are given a year
to make arrangements. Phoenix doesn't have such a policy, although
I'm told one is now being considered.
Three months. Six months. A year. It doesn't matter. A nun told
me, years ago, that we should only discard our bad habits. We don't
need another denomination that chooses economical over ecumeni cal.
We already have houses of worship called General Motors, Mi crosoft
and ATT.
Ella Mae Bleier said the parish did all it could for the nuns.
There are no bad guys in this conflict, she told me.
Maybe so. But, if the Lord really does speak through Father
Spauld ing, I hope He takes a moment soon to retell a story I first
heard from a nun. It's about a nice young couple and their baby
boy.
And how there was no room for them at the inn. E.J. Montini can be reached at 444-8978 or at ed.montini pni.com
