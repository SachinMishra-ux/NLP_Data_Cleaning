In your case, your first stop on the Web should be the site run
by the Bay Area Video Coalition. BAVC's Web site at www.bavc.org
lists scores of jobs in the video and new media fields. BAVC also
offers more than 400 classes in video and new media, along with
screenings and other useful networking events. For membership
information, call (415) 861-3282.
Another site you should check out is www.listfoundation.org,
which has a number of new-media job listings. Other local groups
with job listings for the video and film industry are the Film Arts
Foundation at (415) 552-8760 and Media Alliance at (415) 546-6334.
To land an offer, you'll probably have to follow up with some
old-fashioned in-person networking.
Schedule a vacation trip out here to coincide with some industry
event like a video festival. Then use your Internet contacts or
other personal connections like your college alumni network to
line up informational interviews.
New media and video really are booming in the Bay Area, with
more independent film and video producers per capita than New York
or Los Angeles, according to BAVC.
So do your homework. You're likely to end up with a great San
Francisco job ... and a whole new set of problems.
 Q: My wife's company was recently acquired by another firm.
The new owners have withheld one week's salary from each employee,
and say they intend to hold it until the employee someday leaves
the firm. Is this legal?
 A: It's completely normal for a landlord to demand an extra
month's rent from tenants as a security deposit. But for a company
to withhold a week of employees' pay as some kind of security
deposit? That's extremely unusual, and probably illegal.
State and federal labor codes require firms to pay their workers
in a regular and timely fashion at least twice a month for most
workers, or once a month for salaried or professional workers.
If your firm is socking away your week's pay in some kind of
escrow account, Ross said, it's violating the law. The company
could face misdemeanor charges, or penalties of up to $100 per
employee plus 25 percent of the amount that is being unlawfully
withheld. The place to file a complaint is the office of the
California Labor Commissioner, at (415) 557-7878.
