For Diamondbacks shortstop Jay Bell, it was the best of times
and it was the worst of times. He had the first hit off Thomson,
breaking the shutout with a two-out home run (his eighth) to left
field in the fifth inning, but also struck out twice.
As good as Thomson's location was, he also got help from plate
umpire Jim Quick, who had a liberal strike zone. Particularly
against Diamondbacks rookie first baseman Travis Lee, who struck
out three times.
Finally, Diamondbacks hitting coach Jim Presley had had enough.
He spoke more than volumes, barking at Quick from the dugout and
getting the thumb. He came out of the dugout to complete his
colorful diatribe before Showalter came out to escort him from the
field.
It was the second time a Diamondback had been ejected this
season. Center fielder Devon White was tossed on April 3 against
San Francisco for disagreeing with plate umpire Angel Hernandez on
his choice of strike calls.
There were some pitches thrown by Diamondbacks left-hander Omar
Daal that appeared to be in the same location as those from
Thomson, in some cases better, but Quick's right hand remained at
his side.
Showalter said previously that umpires were testing Lee, but
they appeared to back off for a while. They apparently have resumed
their efforts.
Daal (1-4) gave up single runs in the first, third and fourth
innings, then struck out five in a row.
The Diamondbacks pulled within 3-2 in the sixth when Kelly
Stinnett led off with a walk, was sacrificed to second by Daal and
scored on a triple to right by Andy Fox.
Taking a page out of the Larry Walker book from Wednesday night
and earlier Thursday night when he took extra bases on lethargic
Arizona outfielders, Fox stunned the Rockies' rocket-armed right
fielder by taking third base.
A fly ball to left field by White was too shallow for Fox to
score and the throw by Dante Bichette was on the money. Lee then
took a called third strike, which undoubtedly caused Presley's
blood to start boiling.
