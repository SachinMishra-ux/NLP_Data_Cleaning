But John Williams, a sociologist at the University of Leicester,
doubts that soccer will ever become a major sport in the United
States.
Duncan Sisson, 18, from New York, who watched the U.S. national
team beaten by Germany 2-0 on June 15 at the Paris stadium, said he
prefers soccer to other games like baseball and basketball.
The phrase referred to middle-class housewives, characterized as
soccer moms, who often drove their kids to soccer games or
practices.
It was coined against the background of the growing popularity
of soccer in the United States in this particular demographic
segment two years after the country played host to the World Cup in
1994.
Four years later, as the U.S. team competes in the World Cup in
France, soccer commentators and the media are once again discussing
the same old subject: Is soccer taking hold in the United States?
Some observers say, however, that soccer as a spectator sport
has yet to take root in American society, although it has taken
hold in schools and colleges, and Hispanic immigrants
enthusiastically follow the game.
Some say that soccer does not appeal to the psyche of Americans
as much as basketball because of few goals and no breaks.
According to the Soccer Industry Council of America, a committee
of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, 18 million
Americans played soccer at least once in 1997, unchanged from the
1995 figure. In 1993, the number was 16.4 million.
While soccer has not reached the status of basketball and
baseball, the American Soccer Federation is embarking on a new
project that looks ahead to 2010.
According to the project, about $50 million will be spent for
soccer development during the next 12 years. The federation will
expand on its current program called Project 40, in which teenagers
leave college soccer to join professional teams in exchange for
room, board and scholarship.
