But in her grief, she decided to play, to honor Karolj's memory.
And now, she's in the final, having beaten the top-seeded Hingis at
her own game.
So Thursday, saddened but in a strange way finally unburdened,
Seles was free to be Seles again, the Monica who won three times in
a row at Roland Garros from 1990 through 1992, a feat unprecedented
in tennis' modern age. Or any age since the 1930s.
Hingis hadn't met this Seles, not on a tennis court, anyway. The
Swiss miss didn't know the lady who was taking Hingis' best shots
and returning them with the same accuracy and twice the heat.
She had heard about this Seles, to be sure, but she couldn't
have known her. Hingis tried to put up a brave, happy front
afterward, but she wore a dazed and distant face.
Nobody beats Hingis like that. Nobody. Except somebody just had.
Hingis was, for an afternoon, a little kid again, being spanked by
an elder.
Was she surprised by the fearless, unmitigated fury of the
two-fisted, single-minded, way-it-used-to-be Seles attack?
Could be. Her opponent in Saturday's final, fourth seed Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, won their most recent meeting in the Chase
Championships last fall, but Seles had taken 14 of the previous 15.
Sanchez Vicario, having defeated second-seeded Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in their semifinal, understands only too well what
she's in for.
It remains the only Grand Slam she hasn't won, although she
doesn't turn 18 until late September. She was beaten in the French
Open final a year ago by fellow teen Iva Majoli, but that defeat
followed a long rehabilitation from arthroscopic knee surgery
necessitated by a fall from a horse. She was fine this day.
Just overmatched. The one time Hingis made a move, breaking to
start the second set, Seles promptly broke back at 15-40, forcing
Hingis into an unusually timid net error.
Lots of them. Except Seles, 24, is a force to be reckoned with,
and that changes the coronation equation.
