As for justification, one reason was purely military. A lot of
empires were prowling the oceans on the eve of the 20th century,
and the United States needed strategic position. But the
Spanish-American War also marked the start of a strain of American
foreign policy guided by crusader or missionary impulses.
The war was remarkably short. A superior Navy smashed the
Spanish fleet in Manila Bay and off Santiago, Cuba. The ground war
in Cuba made Theodore Roosevelt, all of 40 years old, the most
popular man in the United States. He had resigned as assistant
secretary of the Navy to lead a volunteer unit, the Rough Riders,
who were certainly rough but did very little riding in Cuba. Their
battles were sharp, vicious crawls through jungle terrain in
killing heat.
Roosevelt, by nearly all accounts, had an extraordinary sense of
his infallibility. Spanish bullets were chin music to him. Two
years later he was president, after the assassination of McKinley
at the start of his second term.
Under the terms of surrender, the United States took control of
Cuba, Puerto Rico and Guam and paid Spain $20 million for the
Philippines. The latter exchange completed the remarkable
acquisition of big pieces of the Spanish empire: 50 years earlier,
for $15 million, America had gained a third of Mexico after a brief
war.
The surrender may have been hard on Spanish national
self-esteem, but it was also a positive turning point for a country
that had been in steep political decline. By a predominant view in
Spain, the country flourished artistically and intellectually
because it was finally free of the corrupting influences of its
empire.
The United States held on to Cuba for four years and the
Philippines for nearly half a century, and has never relinquished
Guam or Puerto Rico. The Maine may be forgotten, but the waves from
that sinking have yet to flatten out. The American century started
with seven world powers and ends with one superpower. Whoever said
history does not turn on accidents?
AUSTIN, Texas With grand plans for the fall election in mind,
state Republican stalwarts gather in Fort Worth this week to kick
off what they hope will be a historic year in Texas politics.
What once was unthinkable is now within reach for the Texas GOP:
a sweep of statewide elected offices, gaining control of the Texas
House for the first time in more than 120 years and keeping its
slim majority in the Texas Senate.
A key factor to winning is the popular and well-funded Gov.
George W. Bush, who is way ahead of Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro in the polls. Many Republicans are hoping
Bush will win big and help push other candidates into office.
Those goals, if achieved, would be historic for the GOP in
Texas, which for decades has been a Democratic stronghold.
