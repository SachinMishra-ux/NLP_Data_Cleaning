Yet for Kim to sustain his role as a model for the region, he
will first have to overcome South Korea's economic crisis. And that
too is a reason for the state visit: Kim will begin his visit in
the financial capital of New York, not the political capital of
Washington, and he will emphasize South Korea's efforts to
restructure its economy and woo foreign investors.
After arriving in New York on Saturday and helping open the
Korea Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and speaking to
several organizations, Kim is to go to Washington on Monday for a
meeting with President Clinton and his speech to Congress.
On Thursday, he will travel to California and deliver a speech
at Stanford University and visit Silicon Valley, whose
entrepreneurial spirit Kim greatly admires. On June 12 he will go
on to Los Angeles, a center for Korean-Americans, and will leave
for home the next day.
The visit is also likely to buoy Kim politically at home.
Initially he was hailed as virtually a national savior when he took
office, even as he lectured his nation on the need to accept the
pain of layoffs and restructuring. But in recent weeks, some Korean
business analysts have said the steam has gone out of his
initiatives.
Not surprisingly, Kim disagrees. He said he is concerned about
rising unemployment but still confident that South Korea is on the
right track to recreate itself as a more open and market-oriented
economy.
One major concern for foreign investors has been the militancy
of South Korean labor unions, which have been hostile to layoffs
and have turned to strikes and sometimes violence to resist
restructuring. The unions have agreed to postpone strikes until
Kim's return from the United States, however, and Kim argues that
the worst is over for the labor unrest.
In his dissident days, Kim was closely allied with labor groups,
but now he seems concerned that they will frighten investors and
block his efforts to create a more flexible market economy.
Apparently seeking to reassure foreigners that the unions have
not gained the upper hand in Korea, he said in the interview that
he will use the full authority of the government to crack down on
unions that violate the law.
The career of Robert F. Kennedy was made for legend: the
youthful privilege giving way to early sorrow, the transformation
from bare-knuckled political operative to compassionate spokesman
for the underdog, the life cut short as its climax seemed within
reach.
A three-hour memoir, which arrives soon after the 30th
anniversary of his assassination, taps the affections of those who
knew him well and can only burnish the image.
