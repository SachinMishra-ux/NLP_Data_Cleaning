On Sunday evening, he was honored at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, where he helped dedicate a new gallery of Korean
art. On Monday, Kim is scheduled to visit the New York Stock
Exchange, where he can be counted on to underline a likely theme of
this visit: reassurance to foreign investors. After New York, he
goes to Washington for meetings with President Clinton and a speech
to Congress, before journeying on to Los Angeles.
CHICAGO Indulge me while I clear out the Belmont Stakes
residue, but I do not see Michael Jordan and the Bulls fading in
the homestretch with another Triple Crown now in sight.
First of all, the trailer has to believe it has the ability to
catch up, but from the sight of the Utah Jazz in the second half
here Sunday night, what we appear to have on our hands is a
pre-race favorite running without faith.
The Jazz didn't just quit Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals. They were dismissed from it. The only mail that
was delivered was the game itself, post-marked by the Jazz, Salt
Lake City. Just when people were forecasting photo finishes between
teams rated evenly matched, the Bulls charged ahead late in the
first half and blew on like a tropical storm in a 96-54 slaughter
that gave them a 2-1 series lead.
The Jazz could have been suffering the effects of having their
grand design for this series ruined by their Game 2 loss Friday
night at home. All the more reason why this team needed to be right
back in the Bulls' faces Sunday night. They went face down on the
United Center floor instead, losing the most lopsided finals game
ever, scoring the fewest points since the shot clock rule and
fueling the notion that, deep down, they don't believe they can
beat the Bulls.
Same shots he always takes, the Jazz said. Same ones he always
makes. The problem with that rationale is that it fails to
acknowledge the psychological component of trying to wrest the
crown off Jordan's head. This is not the typical opponent. This is
not the customary setting. This is not the ordinary challenge, and
that not only goes for Malone but the entire Utah team.
In the case of its best player, from the time Malone has been
playing basketball on the national level, he has been the
quintessential outsider. First he was that muscular kid from little
Louisiana Tech, a school best known for its women's teams. For much
of his professional career, he has been looked at by many of his
peers as the Brother From Another Planet. The African-American
superstar who plays in the whitest of all NBA markets, the
down-home Louisiana guy who drives bikes and trucks, not Range
Rovers and Mercedes.
Mailman Malone stands alone, unless he's communing with John
Stockton on the pick-and-roll. That's been his message, and he has
delivered his share of politically incorrect diatribes, on subjects
ranging from Magic Johnson's popular return in 1992 (he thought it
wasn't a good idea) to the league's formerly hailed drug policy (he
thought it wasn't getting the job done). But these last two
springs, finally making it to the finals, Malone has found himself
face-to-face with the ultimate establishment icon. It has become
immeasurably difficult to have his say in the face of true
greatness.
Maybe they have been the same shots, or maybe they have been
just a step or two deeper, or maybe he's been rushing to take the
quick shot because he knows the Bulls' suffocating Eastern
Conference defense will not give him one that's better. Patrick
Ewing could tell Malone how the ball feels so much more slippery
when the Bulls are swarming, the way they were Sunday night.
Malone was determined to make a statement Sunday night, and
started to by connecting on his first six shots, remembering there
is nothing mystical about Luc Longley's slow-footed defense. Malone
scored 12 first-quarter points, but when he looked up at the
scoreboard, the Jazz had 14 and were trailing by three.
