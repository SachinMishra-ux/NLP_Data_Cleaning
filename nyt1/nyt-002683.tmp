The Bulls stopped the Jazz in its tracks with a defense that was
quick and irritating, especially when it came to Malone.
After Malone made his first six shots the bulk of which came
around an immobile Luc Longley in the first quarter Coach Phil
Jackson sent Dennis Rodman onto the scene at the end of the first
quarter.
Once Rodman stepped onto the floor, Malone lost his edge. He
could not spin by Rodman. He had to score around him as elbows
poked his back and knees banged his shins. Malone made just two of
his next five shots and had seven turnovers.
As Pippen, Harper and Rodman applied pressure, Kukoc was
throwing himself on the floor looking for loose balls and reaching
in to strip the Jazz. He ended the game with six rebounds and four
steals.
He was the perfect complement to a defense that left the Jazz
looking just like any other team from the West usually looks when
faced with the grizzled teams from the East: physically outmatched.
LOS ANGELES Hard to guess this early which will end up as the
!ital!piece de resistance!off! of Web sites once the !ital!Coupe du
Monde!off! begins in France this week.
Maybe the best way to approach it is stick to a few basics until
you've decided just how much information you're willing to accept.
The official World Cup site: In English and French, this site
(www.worldcup98.org) has what you'd expect without too much
advertising clutter. Did you know there are 704 players
participating? Find all their names here. In the store, the
cheapest thing you can pick up (depending on the exchange rate) is
a set of five marbles with the little Woody Woodpecker mascot for
$2.69.
The official U.S. soccer site: Mostly full of press releases
disguised as stories about what's going with the American team
(www.us-soccer.com), but that can be enough to satisfy those who
aren't interested in negative publicity about the team.
The best English resources: Since ABC and ESPN have the U.S.
broadcasting rights, expect ESPN's SportsZone
(http://espn.sportszone) to supplement the event. It already has a
contest (like the NCAA Tournament pool) in which you can pick the
final 16, then finish off the bracket. The other recommended source
is by by Yahoo! (http://soccer.yahoo.com/wc98), which provides
plenty of depth.
