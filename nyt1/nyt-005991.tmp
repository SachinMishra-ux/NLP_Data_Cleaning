Duval keeps himself well grounded. While Woods bounces from
restaurant openings to photo shoots away from the course, the
Floridian goes skiing or surfing off the beaten track. He arrived
at the Open after a week of fishing in Montana. He'll leave the
glitz for Woods, but he remains competitive.
Two weeks ago in Ohio, Duval looked out at a crowded room of
reporters and kidded that they must have been expecting Tiger.
Then, as if acknowledging his newly acquired star status, he had
another observation.
TOKYO As the yen continues to fall, experts worldwide say it
is due to severe loss of confidence in the Japanese economy. In
Japan, the experts say it is Nippon uri, or the selling out of
Japan.
With the official discount rate stuck at 0.5 percent, and many
depositors in Japan getting less than 1 percent interest for their
money, it was inevitable that they would eventually begin to look
abroad. When they did, it was inevitable that the yen would begin
to weaken.
Anyone who keeps his money in yen is losing not just the
interest spread but also the exchange gains, a total of well over
10 percent per annum for the past five years.
What is surprising is not the yen collapse we see today but the
absence of collapse years ago when it was already clear that the
economy would not recover quickly.
Timidity, misguided patriotism and optimism for early recovery
were the main reasons why most Japanese kept their money in Japan.
It has taken the best part of five years, and some easing of the
rules on sending money abroad, for depositors to get smart.
Rather than loss of confidence or the selling out of Japan, what
we see now is a belated understanding of how foreign exchange
markets work.
Similarly with the economy generally. It has long been obvious
that no economy, not even Japan's, could stand a sudden collapse of
the grossly inflated asset values built up during Japan's bubble
economy of the early '90s.
Worse, once the collapse got under way there was every chance
that it would spiral. Even interest rates at close to zero would
not stop the rot.
