Step inside, and it is immediately clear that this is a
different kind of school, with humble resources. Desks line the
main room. Teenagers sit next to small children. The atmosphere is
attentive. There are no classrooms as such, just a single teacher
and two teaching assistants walking up and down.
Grace has 35 children, aged 6 to 18. Its largest-ever graduating
class was three; but in recent years its graduates have gone on to
West Point and Texas AM University, among others.
Because most of these schools do not report to the local
educational authorities, exact numbers are difficult to come by;
but Christian Schools International, one of several umbrella
organizations, claims about 3,200 member schools in the United
States, with 600,000 pupils.
The chief reason for their growth is frustration at the removal
of God from the public schools. But some parents have in general
lost confidence in the state's ability to educate their children,
and others question the government's right to dictate educational
standards.
When is a Christian school a fundamentalist school? There are no
hard-and-fast rules; but an unequivocal belief in creationism is
probably the most reliable indicator.
Parents pay around $125 per child each year for books and course
materials. Some of these courses, such as grammar, are laudable for
their basic approach.
Larger fundamentalist schools charge fees and grant
scholarships, but smaller ones have a different approach. Grace is
typical. Its shoestring budget allows it to educate each child for
roughly $1,000 a year.
Every summer, parents sit down with the school to discuss how
much they can afford to pay, ranging from $50 to $200 a month for
each child. Teachers' pay is paltry. Burges draws a salary only
when all the bills have been paid; in a good year he takes home
$12,000.
Unable to afford a laboratory, Grace uses the great outdoors as
its classroom. In deer season the whole school goes hunting (PE),
butchers a deer (Biology), then cooks it (Home Economics) into
venison burgers for school lunch. And everyone says grace first. (To publish this interesting 625-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

 By ALAN TRUEX c. 1998, Houston Chronicle ELMONT, N.Y. Unlike most racetracks, Belmont Park is truly a
park, with benches, ponds, trees and shrubs. Outside the barn where
D. Wayne Lukas tends his horses, oak trees stand like giant green
umbrellas. Symbolic, perhaps, of the way Lukas has overshadowed his
competition the past decade and a half.
