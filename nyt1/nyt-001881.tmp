The exact profit-sharing formula is not set, but as of a few
weeks before the scheduled reopening in early July, Sternberg is
aiming for a monthly distribution of about 8 percent of profits.
Profit distribution will not be entirely egalitarian. It will be
distributed to workers as fractions of their salary or wage rate.
In other words, the president's fraction is bigger than the maid's
because the president's base pay is higher.
Sternberg still thinks the front line will come out ahead of
where they would have been without profit-sharing. A year from now,
he should know.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. Sometimes, on an afternoon in summer, it can
be fine just to strike out aimlessly in some unfamiliar direction
and see where the road takes you.
That's how childhood summers are recalled as having been
spiced with accidental pleasures. Even now, an eternity past
childhood, that was the feeling of this day.
Our destination, more or less, was the river. Beyond that, there
was no plan.
Once I walked the whole river bank, from the city's west end to
its far eastern limit. There were fresh beaver cuttings in the
willow and cottonwood brakes at the water's edge. And half-buried
mooring cables from the time when the Missouri was a busy highway
of settlement and commerce.
I would like to have shown her that. But the river is harder to
get to now.
It's been most of 30 years ago, and maybe memory is flawed. But
I think you could walk down to it almost anywhere you cared to, and
in many places could drive at least as far as the levee.
There may be ways to do that still, but if so we couldn't find
them. Chains and gates barred every approach.
