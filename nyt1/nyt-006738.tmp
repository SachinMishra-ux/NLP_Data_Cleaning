TOKYO Japan's prime minister is furiously thrashing out the
details of what the government hopes will emerge as a landmark
blueprint to clean up the nation's bad debts.
And the blueprint is likely to be an important topic during
talks when the deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
meets with Japanese government officials and party leaders on
Friday.
After playing down the bad-loan problem for years, the
government now acknowledges that clearing away the loans may be the
single most important factor in building confidence overseas and in
giving a lift to the economy.
The problem loans, which have swelled to more than $600 billion more than the size of the entire Chinese economy have been a
drag on the economy for years but now the government seems
increasingly determined to clean up the mess over the next three
years.
Some foreign investors are wary of new promises from the
government because they have been let down so many times. But other
analysts and economists say that while enormous uncertainties
remain, there are signs that the government may finally be ready to
implement the Total Plan, as it is being called here.
The changes would take time but they could result in a sounder
banking sector, a more vibrant real estate market and a healthier
economy overall.
But Yoshitomi argues that up until now, only the politicians
have broken from the pack to tackle the bad debt while the
regulators and the banks themselves have shown enormous reluctance.
The Total Plan is being hammered out by about two dozen
high-level Liberal Democrat politicians and bureaucrats, who will
convene a major session next Tuesday to review a draft. The
chairman is Okiharu Yasuoka, a Liberal Democrat member of the lower
house.
The plan has been through many versions and is still changing,
and about $17 billion has been set aside for it in the government's
$123 billion stimulus package. As described by government
officials, economists and bankers, the Total Plan focuses on the
bad loans and on the properties Japanese banks are stuck with
because they were the collateral for the loans.
In the past banks have often set aside reserves for questionable
loans but they generally have not sold those properties or
liquidated the bad loans. One result has been a huge drag on the
property market and a continuing burden on the banks.
