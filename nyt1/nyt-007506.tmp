Rachel Gregory, a menswear buyer for Nordstrom stores, agreed
with Hall but said that in a creative or fashion field, she'd
expect prospective employees to be more edgy in their attire.
It's a concept that attorneys such as Christopher Keosian, a
civil litigation and bankruptcy attorney with Keosian Keosian of
Century City, near Beverly Hills, understand and utilize in their
client's best interest.
A plaintiff attorney, Keosian said he advises his clients to
dress similarly, making sure the tie isn't too flashy, such as a
polka-dot design, because it conveys a liberal, risky person. The
best choice? It's usually a conservative striped tie with a white
shirt.
The staple of preppy dressing, it was never designed to be worn
with elegant suits. Fashion experts will tell you it's meant to be
worn with summer seersuckers, navy-blue blazers and rep ties, or
worn tieless with khakis on casual Fridays.
While others have double-bogeyed, tripled-bogeyed, succumbed to
fits of frustration, or surrendered to the torturous conditions at
the Olympic Club, Stewart has found ways to persevere. When play
ended Saturday night, Stewart was the lone player under par, and he
had never worked so hard to keep a red number next to his name.
It has taken some of the best golf of Stewart's career to take a
four-stroke lead into Sunday's final round. And if Stewart can hold
on, after winning just once on the PGA Tour during the last seven
years, this victory would rank as his sweetest. Standing at
two-under-par 207 for the tournament after Saturday's even par
round of even-par 70, Stewart held a four-stroke lead over Tom
Lehman and Bob Tway.
Lee Janzen and Nick Price were tied for fourth place at two
over, still close enough to make a final-round charge, especially
if Stewart finally falters.
But those waiting for Stewart to succumb to the pressure may be
waiting a long time. Stewart was the last first-round leader to win
the U.S. Open, when he won in 1991 at Hazeltine National Golf Club
in Chaska, Minn. Stewart has led after all three rounds this year,
and after Saturday's steady performance, he seemed confident
heading into Sunday.
Yet Stewart will be chased by formidable players. The cream rose
to the top Saturday, and the top five contenders are all former
major winners. Lehman is the 1996 British Open champion. Tway won
the 1986 PGA Championship. Price has won four majors in his
brilliant career, most recently the 1994 PGA Championship. And
Janzen won the 1993 U.S. Open.
Lehman, who shot a 68 Saturday, will be the sentimental favorite
among the gallery. From 1995 through '97, Lehman ended the third
round of the U.S. Open either alone in first place, or tied for the
lead. Yet he has never won the championship that he wants the most,
and he sounded almost relieved that he will not start Sunday with
the lead again.
