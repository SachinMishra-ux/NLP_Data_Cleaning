They borrowed a car and Genest drove her to the hospital that
evening. Later that night she was told she had leukemia, her
parents and younger sister flew in from California and soon she had
no hair, had a tube in her chest, wouldn't leave the hospital for
weeks and would be in treatment for months.
There were tough times ahead, though Anderson feels lucky she
didn't get nearly as sick in treatment as many people do. She has
been told she will not be able to have children.
There was the projected two years of chemotherapy in seven
phases and there was getting to the end of the fifth phase and
being told that the chemotherapy had been suppressed but not wiped
out and she needed the bone marrow transplant.
Both her sisters were a perfect match for a transplant and she
received her bone marrow from her older sister, Julia.
The transplant was a success and she got back to school in the
fall of 1996 and tried to get back to volleyball but was not yet
physically able. That was tough. So she served as kind of an
assistant coach.
She kept working on her strength and conditioning and last fall
was ready to go. Still, there were drawbacks. She did not have her
old leaping ability so was better suited for defensive work in the
back lines than up front.
Anderson had no doubts. She was determined to do so as she spent
her time in the hospital and charted her own medications and
treatments. As the cards and letters and jerseys from players at
Harvard and Alaska and dozens of other teams and players she had
come in contact with poured in. As she planned with doctors including Dr. Robin Joyce at Beth Israel who her mother, Pat, raves
about her return to Bentley and volleyball.
She turned 23 last Sunday and this Sunday evening in Florida,
Honda will recognize the way she came back.
TRIBUNAL (Rome) Seeking to limit the scope of an international
criminal court, The United States dismisses United Nations efforts
to create a fully independent prosecutor as `unrealistic and
unwise.` By Alessandra Stanley.
AIDS-IMMUNE (Undated) Scientists have visualized the precise
interactions between the AIDS virus and a human cell at the moment
of infection. The ultra-fine snapshot shows how the virus's probe
changes form as it snags, one after the other, its two targets on
the human cell's surface. The new information lays the basis for
designing new drugs and vaccines that strike at the virus during
its one moment of vulnerability, its change of shape while it moves
from its first to its second target. By Nicholas Wade.
