But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
Hubby and Wifey who don't want their real names used are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
