In the meantime, the major golf manufacturers have responded
swiftly and angrily. Callaway Golf, makers of the Great Big Bertha
and Greatest Big Bertha titanium drivers, which would be on the
USGA's extinction list if the rules were adopted, issued a 3{-page
news release announcing it would join with other companies in
opposing any such USGA rulings banning modern clubs. In addition,
Callaway bought full-page ads in the New York Times, USA Today and
Golf World to present its position.
But while the USGA is threatening and the manufacturing world is
reeling, the one organization that would be most affected if all
the new changes were adopted is taking a wait-and-see attitude.
The weekend hackers who dished out $500 a pop for a Big Bertha
driver might be disappointed if their weapon of choice is taboo.
But those golfers trying to make a living using the same driver on
the PGA Tour have considerably more to lose.
The PGA Tour is its own organization, separate from the USGA,
but it follows the rules as set down by the USGA. And PGA Tour
officials don't see that changing in the future, regardless of
which way the USGA rules on the equipment issue.
In other words, any sweeping changes in equipment rules made by
the USGA for their own competitions would also affect the events on
the PGA Tour as well. The pros could kiss their titanium drivers,
long putters and perimeter-weighted irons goodbye.
Some PGA Tour pros, such as The Woodlands Jeff Maggert, find it
a little hard to believe the USGA would go to such lengths.
Maggert agreed technology has come a long way in recent years.
But in his mind, the length of the putter and the type of the
driver make less of a difference than the size and condition of the
athlete using it.
Yet despite his disapproval of the USGA's proposals, Maggert
remained firm in his belief that if the USGA changes the rules, for
better or worse, the PGA Tour needs to follow them.
LOS ANGELES At first glance, when the Anaheim Angels took USC
ace Seth Etherton with the 18th pick in last week's Major League
Baseball amateur draft, it was a bit shocking.
True, by the end of USC's national-championship run, Etherton
was considered one of college baseball's most polished pitchers.
After he beat defending national champion Louisiana State on
Thursday in a must-win game in Omaha, Neb., he was 13-3 with an ERA
hovering around 3.00 and 182 strikeouts, a Pacific-10 single-season
record.
