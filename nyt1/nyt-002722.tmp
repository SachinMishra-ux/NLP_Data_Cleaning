SEARCH: The Raiders are still in the market for a backup
quarterback. They were outbid for Dave Brown (who signed with
Arizona), passed on Jim Everett (health concerns) and are not
especially interested in re-signing David Klingler.
Gruden said the team will continue its search for the next few
weeks. Former Baltimore starter Vinny Testaverde is a free agent,
but he probably wants a chance to start and more money than the
Raiders are willing to pay.
They could head to training camp with Donald Hollas as the No. 2
quarterback. Hollas, who was No. 3 on the depth chart last season,
has collected plenty of snaps during offseason workouts.
Defensive coordinator Willie Shaw is installing a new scheme,
predicated on putting pressure on the quarterback. Something needs
to change, because the Raiders ranked 30th (last) in the league in
total defense last season.

PARIS It was a good day for a pesadilla a nightmare where he
comes from and that's exactly what Alex Corretja endured for 2
hours and 18 minutes Sunday in full view of 16,000 tennis patrons
at Stade Roland Garros, plus millions of freeloaders at teleside
across the globe.
Worse, Corretja sees across the net a huge long-haired guy in
baggy clothes, resembling an old-time burlesque comedian, but
there's nothing funny about the way he smacks balls too hard and
fast to handle. He looks like Corretja's long-time amigo, Charlie Carlos Moya but would Charlie treat him this way?
It's bad, but not a dream after all. Unless you consider it from
Charlie Moya's standpoint a dream come true, winning the French
Open, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3, and rising to No. 5 in the world from No. 12.
Better still, retaining No. 1 in Barcelona, the capital of the
game, still ahead of Corretja, who ascended to world No. 9 from No.
14.
The reign of Spain (a.k.a. Barcelona) stayed mainly on this dirt
plain in the Bois de Boulogne as 21-year-old Moya, a monster out of
a nightmare if there ever was one here, followed up on Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario's 7-6 (7-5), 0-6, 6-2 title victory over Monica
Seles Saturday.
Same scenario four years ago to the accompaniment of scarlet and
gold Spanish and Catalan flags ruffling and snapping happily. Only
then Sergi Bruguera was Arantxa's dirt-dancing partner. But Moya,
with his bludgeoning forehand and serve, startling speed, and
surprising volleying touch has more possibilities than Bruguera.
