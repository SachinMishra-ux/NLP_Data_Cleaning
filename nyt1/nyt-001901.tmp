After watching the Jazz put the Chicago Bulls in a place they
haven't experienced in seven years behind in the Finals on
Wednesday night, it is apparent that I severely misread the
expiration date stamped on the side of the Jazz.
A bit of solace in the faulty judgment comes from the fact that
the premature obituary of the Jazz was written, read and accepted
by lots of people, including the handful of folks smarter than
sportswriters.
That might be true, but the more likely cause is that few have
ever seen the likes of Stockton and Malone. We're not talking about
their floor games here; certainly, every sports fan in Seattle
knows the Malone-Stockton pick-and-roll better than they know
breakfast. Malone's big haunches have been backing down on Sonic
post men for a dozen years.
It's just that Malone and Stockton keep doing it. Again and
again and again. Malone has missed just five games out of the 1,076
in his career. Until Stockton missed this season's first 18 games
recovering from knee surgery, he had missed just four compared to
the 1,158 games he had put in.
Among all the accolades, statistics and awards that these future
Hall of Famers have accumulated, their constancy of excellence at
the top of the NBA game is the most astonishing feat.
A little bit is luck from lack of injuries. But the source for
this legacy is the supplementing of their physical gifts with a
work ethic that is unsurpassed.
The only way Stockton, 35, and Malone, 35 next month, can be
attempting to wrest the NBA world from the Midwestern Hercules is
through a year-round dedication that is unknown to so many younger
stars.
Newcomers to the Jazz team are regularly dumbstruck by Malone's
habits. He arrives two hours before practice to lift weights, and
after practice he spends an hour on a Stairmaster.
Stockton takes two weeks off after the season, then begins a
cruel regimen back home in Spokane that has him up to a five-hour
daily workout by August.
His resting heart rate is 35 beats a minute, which is half the
rate of the average person. He and Malone have 4 percent body fat,
about what is found on world-class bike racers. Their
cardiovascular systems, lung capacities and blood pressures are far
superior to most athletes in any sport.
