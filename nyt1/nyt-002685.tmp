In the wake of Hoddle's decision and England's sluggish efforts
in the exhibitions, British bookmaker Ladbrokes last week
lengthened the odds of England's winning the World Cup from 7-1 to
8-1.
Clearly, the English remain a threat not just to win the group,
but the World Cup. But they also need to regroup fast, or Colombia
and Romania could again leave the English wondering what happened.
The Romanians might have the team on the biggest roll. Veterans
Gheorghe Hagi, Gheorghe Popescu and Bogdan Stelea are performing
well in what should be this talented group's last hurrah. And
remember, this is a team that defeated Colombia, the United States
and Argentina four years ago before losing on penalty kicks to
Sweden.
The qualifying competition was relatively weak this time for the
Romanians, but they still went 9-0-1, and that's hard to ignore.
Four years ago, many experts pegged this team to win the
tournament before disaster struck. Andres Escobar, the murdered
defender, will be a name forever etched in World Cup history.
This time, Colombia has been a mere afterthought to many
handicappers of the World Cup. But many players off the 1994 team
return this summer in hopes of easing some of the bad memories. The
likes of Carlos Valderrama and Freddy Rincon might be a step
slower, but their skills remain.
It should be a remarkably entertaining group, start to finish,
with only the Tunisians likely to finish where expected at the
bottom.
Let the seller beware. That appears to be a principal lesson in
the decision of Merrill Lynch to pay $437 million to settle civil
suits brought against it in the wake of the Orange County, Calif.,
bankruptcy.
Merrill Lynch warned Robert Citron, the county treasurer who
later pleaded guilty to securities fraud, that his strategy of
borrowing money to buy risky derivative securities for the county's
investment fund might blow up if interest rates rose, as they did.
But Citron wanted to keep buying, and Merrill kept selling.
Merrill was hardly alone in knowing the strategy was risky. It
had become a political issue in Orange County, but the county
supervisors, happy to spend the profits generated when the strategy
was working, did not intervene.
