The Bulls have a palatial locker room and their own practice
facility. The Celtics used to dress in a slanted locker room in the
old, old Garden in which the tall guys stood at the top of the roof
slant and the small guys dressed at the bottom. Lockers? How about
nails? They practiced in such places as the Cambridge YMCA and
Tobin Gym after begging for the time.
All these differences make it far easier for the Bulls to play
at their best. The flip side is that the old Celtics had far fewer
distractions. They never had off-day press conferences. They had no
endorsement deals. They were inherently hungrier and more dedicated
because, well, just because. So it was easier for them to focus on
the task at hand.
There are many ways of evaluating the differences between the
Russell Celtics and the Jordan Bulls. Here are a few:
In order to win his first nine titles, Russell and his mates had
to play two series a year. Win eight games and you're a champ. In
order to win their six, Michael and Scottie have had to win four
series annually. They need to win almost twice as many games (15)
in order to get their rings.
It stands to reason that the more games you play, the more peril
exists. Just because you're supposed to win doesn't mean you're
going to.
Russell began play in an eight-team league. The best 80
basketball players in the world were concentrated on those teams.
Even the worst teams had, in the context, very good players in
reserve. When he won championship No. 11, the NBA still had only 14
teams.
The Bulls' championship run began seven years ago in a 27-team
league. It's now up to 29. Almost no one has a decent bench.
Centers are scarce. The talent is pathetically dispersed, and some
of the best players choose to stay in Europe.
Only Houston hardheads would deny that the Rockets won a pair of
championships (1994, 1995) that would have been Chicago's had
Jordan not taken his famous sabbatical.
Fine. But does anyone outside St. Louis believe the Hawks would
have won in 1958 if Russell had not injured his ankle? Twelve out
of 13 sounds pretty impressive.
We respect the Russell Celtics because they knew how to win the
so-called Big Game. Russell played in 11 winner-take-all games, 10
seventh games (five in the Finals) and one fifth. He was 11-0, and
in those games, he averaged 18 points and 30 rebounds.
