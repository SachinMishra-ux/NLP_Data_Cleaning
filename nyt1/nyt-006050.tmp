Let's start at the very beginning -- that dull start-up screen
on your computer. You'll need some new wallpaper. This kind of
wallpaper doesn't come with paste. It's the background image on
your computer screen. Let's replace the dull stuff Windows uses
with one of your favorite photos.
If you have a scanner, you can convert the photo to a digital
image yourself. If you don't have one, most photography places and
some office supply stores can do the conversion for just a few
dollars. Save the image as a bitmap file (that's a file that has a
BMP extension). Then put the image file in your Windows folder.
Here's what to do next. Let's say you called your file
CECIL.BMP. Simply right-click on the screen, go to Display
Properties and you'll find CECIL has been added to your wallpaper
choices. Just select it and there, big as life, is a picture of you
holding that big bass you caught last year.
Things are looking up now, but you still have a long way to go
before you're truly trendy. Now you'll need your own Web page. It
isn't enough to cruise the Web these days, you need a home on the
Web. Personal Web pages are important holding areas for all the bad
poetry you've ever written, for the photographs no one wanted to
see from your last vacation. You'll also want to put in links to
your favorite Web sites. (Be careful with the last item. You really
don't want to put in your favorite Web sites. Instead, use Web
sites that offer impossible-to-understand technical information.
The more technical the Web site, the cooler you are.)
If you are rich and foolish, you can get space to park your Web
page from your current Internet provider. But, unless free Web
space is part of your account, you can use one of the many services
that gives Web space away.
You could take a community college class and learn to write the
HTML code needed to create the Web page itself. But, instead, let's
go to a free site and download a program called AOL Press. It works
like a word processor and can spit out a Web page in just minutes.

You're almost cool now. But there's one crowning touch. Live
chat is very trendy. You can spend hours each night telling
flattering untruths about yourself to complete strangers who, in
return, will do the same thing.
But anyone can log on to one of the chat channels and meet
people. What you need is your very own chat room. Hey, it's the
difference between renting and owning. You'll be able to put a link
to it on the Web page we just built, and instead of meeting your
friends on some public chat channel, you can meet at your place.
Just go to the following Web address -- http://www.parachat.com/
-- and, in just seconds, you'll get everything you need to start
your own chat service.
Despite several attempts to fashion a compromise under pressure
from the White House and Congress, law enforcement officials remain
deeply at odds with the software industry over the encryption
issue.
