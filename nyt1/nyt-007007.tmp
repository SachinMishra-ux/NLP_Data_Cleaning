Democrats and Republicans agree that without Holbrooke's
constant prodding, the Bosnian peace accord would not have been
signed in 1995. But not everyone is a fan of Holbrooke or the
peacekeeping mission he engineered.

Cigarette makers had saturated the airwaves with a $40 million
assault on the plan. The measure had mushroomed from a $368.5
billion blueprint to a $516 billion package stuffed with so many
special-interest extras that not even its staunchest supporters
would defend it in its entirety.
And House Speaker Newt Gingrich had recently sent a chilling
message to his Senate colleagues. With Republicans at risk of
losing control of the House in the November elections, Gingrich
wanted no part of the high-stakes debate over the plan to punish
the tobacco industry for the next 25 years.
Thursday, Lott and Gringrich said they will try to move forward
a narrower, less costly tobacco bill, while supporters of the
Senate bill launched a prolonged effort to revive the measure.
The continued skirmishing is part of a saga rich with
legislative infighting, political intrigue, and competing
presidential ambitions. And though the antitobacco plan's official
cause of death was listsed as a one-two parliamentary punch by
Senate Republican leaders and their allies, an examination of the
plan's brief, tumultuous life showed many other factors contributed
to its demise.
It was a year ago Saturday that Moore, the attorneys general
from 39 other states, and lawyers for smokers with tobacco-related
illnesses reached an agreement with the cigarette makers.
The deal gave the industry what it wanted: financial stability
that would come with immunity from future class-action lawsuits and
a $5 billion annual cap for individual liability claims.
In exchange, the cigarette companies agreed to pay $368.5
billion over 25 years to help states pay for smoking-related
medical costs and antismoking initiatives. The industry also would
stop most of its marketing practices, including the use of Joe
Camel and the Marlboro Man. And the Food and Drug Administration
would be granted authority to regulate nicotine as a drug, with the
power to ban it as early as 2010.
Morris had worked in Mississippi for trial lawyer Richard
Scruggs, polling on the tobacco issue in preparation for a
potential lawsuit. The polling, Morris said Thursday, showed that
even smokers favored greater restrictions on teenage smoking.
