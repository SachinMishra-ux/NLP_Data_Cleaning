In 1989 in Canterbury, England, the world's leading experts on
frogs and other amphibians gathered for their first ever world
congress.
In the lobby, in the bar and in chance encounters in the hall,
the experts swapped frog stories. At some point they realized that
they were all seeing the same problem: Their frogs and toads were
dying not just in disturbed habitats, but in the most pristine
nature preserves from brown toads in Yosemite National Park to
golden toads in Costa Rica.
Today the case of the dying frogs is well documented, but what's
interesting is that no one still knows exactly why they are dying.
So conservationists are asking: Are the frogs the canaries in our
coal mine? Miners used to take canaries underground with them; if
the canary died, that would indicate the presence of deadly but
odorless carbon monoxide and warn miners to flee. Are the frogs
sounding such an alarm?
Is it something mankind is doing, and if so, is it something
that will eventually threaten mankind? Is it the increase in
ultraviolet light from holes in the ozone that is reducing the
frogs' immunity to viruses, parasites and fungi? Is it chemicals
and pesticides in the atmosphere? Is it rising temperatures?
These questions were worrying enough for the National Science
Foundation to bring together in Washington last week a group of top
environmental scientists to swap research on what might be killing
the frogs.
Worse, this loss of biodiversity is happening just as
life-science companies are making real breakthroughs in their
ability to collect plants and animals from highly biodiverse
environments and screen them for useful genes that can be isolated
from that plant or animal and then used for medical cures or to
stimulate agriculture.
For instance, it's genes from the rosy periwinkle, a flowering
plant from Madagascar, that are now used to treat childhood
leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. To the extent that we are losing
biodiversity through extinctions, we are shrinking this natural
storehouse of lifesaving genes, and we will never have access to
them again.
It also calls into question the distinction too often made
between home and away, between protected areas and nonprotected
areas. Home is where you keep clean, and away is where you pollute.
But maybe the frogs from Canada and Costa Rica, Yosemite and
Australia are telling us that this distinction isn't valid anymore.
Maybe they're telling us that home is home and away is home, and if
you pollute one you pollute the other. Maybe they're telling us
about the limits of our knowledge and warning us to do something
about the silent species we are losing through development and
deforestation before it's too late.
