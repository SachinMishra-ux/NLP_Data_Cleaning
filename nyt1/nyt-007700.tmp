The IPO for the Corte Madera-based home furnishings retailer
sprang out of the box Friday with a vengeance. After pricing shares
at $19 a dollar higher than anticipated by underwriters Restoration closed its first day of trading at an impressive $26.25
a share.
And while a 38 percent rise on the first day of trading is
outstanding by almost any measure, the jump is particularly
impressive since it arrives amid a moribund IPO climate.
For one thing, it's not really a hardware store at all. While it
started in Eureka 18 years ago as a seller of decorative doorknobs
and hard-to-find drawer handles for folks refurbishing old homes,
the company now with 44 stores in 21 states has evolved into an
innovative merchant of stylish home furnishings that don't
necessarily cost an arm and a leg.
You can bet that mall developers and landlords can. They are in
lust with the retailer and its customers' wallets. In fact, both
mall and strip center developers are interested in bringing
Restoration to their projects, which gives the merchant a bundle of
opportunities to open new stores in some of the choicest spots in
the country. Many retailers are typecast as suitable only for
regional malls or just strip centers, but seldom both, retail
analysts say. But Restoration busts through that barrier,
essentially allowing the company to double its options for choosing
locations.
And because adding more stores is critical to the performance of
most retail stocks, prime real estate locations can drive a
company's sales and profits.
In many cases, the amount of rent paid by retailers is linked to
their sales performance. And in recent years, the registers have
been ringing big-time at Restoration's stores. Check out these
numbers:
For the fiscal year ended January 31, Restoration's average
sales per square foot of selling space were $583. In comparison,
stores in the top malls in the country report sales of $400 to $450
per square foot, says Location-net's Huber.
Last year, Restoration recorded sales of $97.9 million and
operating profits of $3.2 million. And the all-important same-store
sales figures have risen an average of 19 percent annually during
the past two fiscal years.
What's more, Restoration plans to open 25 new stores by the end
of this fiscal year and another 30 stores in 1999.
 But there is some potential danger. While aggressive growth
is good in the eyes of fund managers, especially during a booming
economy, it also presents risk. Restoration doesn't have a long
track record showing that it can roll out new stores at such a
rapid clip. Cloning the culture of the stores is essential for
successful expansion.
