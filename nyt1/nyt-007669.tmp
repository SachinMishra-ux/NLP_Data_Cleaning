Going into this World Cup, the operative theory was that height
would play a big part in the Iran game, but here was a 5-9 player
matched against two of the smaller Yanks who should normally not
have been back there defending the goal in the first place.
The defensive scramble was symptomatic of a team with little
character or leadership. The Iranians played hard and they played
resourcefully, and when it was over, they sought out the Americans
for the normal sporting gestures. One Iranian player walked half
the length of the field to muss the hair of Reyna, who was
obviously stunned. Several players exchanged shirts on the field,
an open sign of sporting acceptance by two nations that have had
their differences.
Perhaps the gestures will lead to warmer relations between the
nations. For the Americans, the shirts will be a memento of a
historic loss that will hurt for a long time, not for the politics,
but for the end of hope.
SAN FRANCISCO While nobody was looking. While all attention
was on a pair two twosomes ahead. While those who ride darkhorses
were saddling up Tom Lehman. While the old Olympic Club course
stood firm in defense of its harsh reputation. Lee Janzen slipped
in the side door and won the U.S. Open. Payne Stewart had held the
lead for three days, and the lead in a U.S. Open can become a heavy
load.
Tom Watson had predicted the winning score would be over par. He
was close. All Janzen had to do was shoot even par for 72 holes,
two rounds of 73 to go with 66 Friday and a closing 68, one of only
five rounds under par Sunday. Of all the names on the leaderboard,
only three showed gains for the day, Janzen, the champion, Jeff
Sluman with a 68 and David Duval with a 69.
This is Janzen's second Open championship, and the fellow he
thwarted was the same fellow he thwarted at Baltusrol in 1993.
Stewart had a putting chance on the last green, 25 feet downhill on
the slippery 18th. Eleven years ago, when Scott Simpson won here,
Watson left a 25-foot uphill putt two inches short. This time,
Stewart's putt drifted three inches below the hole.
He wears plus-fours, flat caps, startling colors and chews gum.
He lights up the horizon. Janzen is a fellow of placid appearance,
makes no waves, stirs no emotions. He has been a solid, steady
player since he first hit the PGA Tour in 1990, a rookie out of
Florida Southern College. He came out of Minnesota, lived awhile in
Maryland, now lives in the same area as Stewart in the Orlando
area.
This was the eighth tournament he has won, and makes up by a
whopping lot for a couple that got away this year. He made a
serious run in The Players Championship and faded, had the lead in
Houston and dropped out of sight. He hadn't won since the Sprint
International three years ago. He has made a more than average
contribution to U.S. Open history. When he beat Stewart at
Baltusrol, his score of 272 tied the championship record that Jack
Nicklaus has set there in 1980. It still stands.
Olympic has a habit of delivering champions from out of the
ranks. An obscure Jack Fleck won a playoff from Ben Hogan in 1955.
Bill Casper beat Arnold Palmer in 1963 and Simpson's winning set
off no national celebrations. So Janzen sat there looking about as
surprised as anybody, surely as thankful as those just happy to
have a winner rather than a playoff.
BOGOTA, Colombia With horns blaring and banners fluttering
from car windows, Colombians voted a resounding end on Sunday to
the scandal-ridden presidency of Ernesto Samper, electing as his
successor the man who first accused Samper of accepting money from
drug dealers.
