Greer said he shudders at the thought of a 95-mph fastball at
the chest being called a strike.
Bosman said the best way to get a generous strike zone from an
umpire is to throw strikes. As Bobby Witt learned early in his
career, hard-throwing pitchers who can't get near the strike zone
get no benefit of the doubt when they occasionally find the corner.
MOSCOW The Russian government announced Thursday that it would
seek $10 billion to $15 billion in additional assistance from the
International Monetary Fund.
Russia has been quietly negotiating with IMF representatives for
weeks over the conditions for additional aid. But Thursday marked
the first time that it has publicly declared its position.
With its financial markets still reeling from the flight of
foreign investors from emerging markets, Russia is approaching a
critical round of talks with the fund.
Stanley Fischer, the second-ranking IMF official, plans to come
to Moscow early next week to meet with Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and other top aides. The purpose of his visit is take the
measure of President Boris Yeltsin's new team and assess its plans
for dealing with the financial crisis.
The fund is also planning to send a separate team of experts.
But while Russia's officials and Western investment bankers have
been heartened by the reports of the IMF visit, not all the news
was encouraging.
Thursday the IMF said it was delaying the disbursement of the
next $670 million installment of the $10 billion loan because the
government has not fulfilled all of the conditions for receiving
the money. The IMF indicated, however, that it expected the $670
million to be disbursed next week.
Russia's financial markets have continued to be very shaky. One
big concern is that the Central Bank's reserves, which are about
$14.5 billion, are not sufficiently larger to prop up the ruble.
Another worry is that Russia is sitting on a mountain of short-term
debt, which it has financed by selling Treasury Bonds at huge
interest rates.
The IMF is not the only source of financing. Russia has also
sought to sell Eurobonds. Thursday, Russia sold $2.5 billion in new
bonds. But the fund is still a key source of potential financing.
