She said the Chattahoochee appeared headed for inclusion on the
list of 10 waterways the council will recommend to Clinton. More
than 125 communities around the country nominated rivers for the
program. But at a meeting Tuesday in St. Louis, council officials
told Champion that the Chattahoochee would not be recommended.
Champion said more than 3,500 residents and elected officials in
Georgia and Alabama, and 21 cities and counties had signed letters

WEST PALM BEACH Residents of one of the city's poorest
neighborhoods were blessed with thousands of sports and outdoor
shoes recently after looters raided a tractor-trailer filled with 5
tons of name brands parked a block off Tamarind Avenue.
An anonymous caller later told police that drug dealers broke
into the 18-wheeler first, followed by others who wanted new men's

they'd sat down to try on their new shoes, Woods said.

the shoes.
Only Edward Robinson, the loss prevention director at the
Mississippi salvage yard where the shoes were to be delivered for
reshipment, called the police giveaway an outrage.

They're cheap and they're available. Thus it was interesting to
see this query, and the response it brought, on the Internet:
