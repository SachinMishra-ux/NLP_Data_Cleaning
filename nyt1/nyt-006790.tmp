That was the sixth consecutive victory in by-elections for the
Liberal Democrats, and polls suggest that they will also do very
well in elections for the upper house on July 12. The upper house
is much less significant than the lower house, but the election
will nonetheless be an important test of sentiment, and Hashimoto
seems ready to pass with flying colors.
A poll this week in the Yomiuri newspaper, taken just before the
intervention to support the yen, found that the support for
Hashimoto's government had dipped, from 33 to 30 percent. But
perhaps more important, 29 percent of those interviewed said they
still supported the Liberal Democrats, compared to 5.5 percent for
the leading opposition group, the Democratic Party.
The Liberal Party, which advocates precisely the far-reaching
economic reorganization and stimulus policies that Washington would
like to see in Japan, had the support of 1.7 percent.
There have been widespread hints that Mr. Hashimoto will be more
aggressive in tackling Japan's financial problems immediately after
the election. But that, too, tells something about the public mood.
Instead of promising before the election to address the economic
mess and mountain of bad bank loans, the speculation is that he
will tackle these issues only after he no longer has to face the
voters.
Morse argues that Japan suffers from cronyism and structural
economic problems quite similar to those of South Korea and
Indonesia. Those countries were bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund on the condition that they accept painful
reorganizations.
But Japan has not collapsed in the way that South Korea or
Indonesia did, so Morse said he believed that the political process
would not lead to a fundamental overhaul of the economy.
Tobacco stocks rebounded Thursday, the day after the latest
version of a tobacco-settlement bill was stubbed out like, well, a
cigarette.
Shares of Philip Morris Cos., the maker of Marlboro, rose
$1.125, to $39.5625. RJR Nabisco climbed 75 cents, to $25.0625.
Even Brooke Group, the parent of Liggett Myers that became
popular recently because of an earlier deal that freed it from tax
penalties proposed in the bill, showed some spark during trading,
though it closed down 25 cents.
Was this a sigh of relief from investors who have been on a
rough ride for the last several years? A momentary uptick in the
sagging fortunes of corporations stuck with products destined for
the ash heap of history? Or was it a long-overdue recognition of
the inherent value of companies like RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris,
regardless of the all-too-visible hand of Congress?
