Barzani, who was formerly on the CIA's payroll, double-crossed
the agency by inviting the Iraqi army into his territory in August
1996, crushing a U.S. covert action program that was based on
Kurdish support, according to U.S. intelligence officials.
Barzani's actions led to the scattering of thousands of Kurds
and other dissidents who had supported the U.S. effort to undermine
support for Saddam. About 6,000 Kurds were eventually provided
refuge in the United States after Barzani's betrayal.
Now, rival Kurdish leaders say that the smuggling business is
earning Barzani millions of dollars, while putting him directly
into business with Uday Hussein, Saddam's son. The rival Kurds say
that at least part of the Barzani group's revenues are paid as
kickbacks to Uday Hussein. Independent oil experts agree that Uday
Hussein appears to be in overall charge of smuggling operations. 
The department reported that the trade deficit for April
expanded to a new monthly high of $14.5 billion, well above the
$13.3 billion projected by many economists, and up sharply from
$13.2 billion in March.
The rise was partly accounted for by technical changes in the
way the government measures aircraft exports, and reflected the
swollen value of the dollar in relation to Asian currencies. But
the figures showed that the deepening economic slump through much
of Asia was drying up demand for many types of goods, costing U.S.
exporters orders in what had been one of their fastest-growing
markets.
Total exports in April fell by 2.5 percent, to $77.1 billion,
the lowest level in 14 months. Imports decreased eight-tenths of 1
percent, to $91.6 billion.
The drop in exports suggested that economic growth was slowing
from a robust pace earlier in the year. A slowdown would reduce the
risks of an increase in inflation, which many analysts think is the
main threat to sustained economic health. But it would also cut
into job creation and further bite into corporate profits, a
prospect that is already souring the partylike atmosphere on Wall
Street.
The United States' largest exporter, Boeing Co. of Seattle, said
Thursday that it expected a deepening recession in Asia to cost it
orders for 90 aircraft over the next five years. Although the
company said no Asian airlines had yet canceled any orders, Boeing
has already announced plans to slow production of its flagship 747
jumbo jet.
Farmers, manufacturers of industrial materials and automakers
are also affected particularly hard by the export crunch, the
Commerce Department said. Texas Instruments, the technology
company, said Thursday that it would cut 3,500 jobs worldwide 8
percent of its work force because of weak demand for
semiconductors from Asia and deep price cuts by Asian competitors
struggling to survive the downturns in their home markets.
Glassman said he expects growth to slow to 1.5 percent in the
second quarter from 4.8 percent in the first quarter, and to be
roughly flat in the second half of the year before rebounding in
1999.
