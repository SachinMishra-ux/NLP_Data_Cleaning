The latest issue of U.S. News World Report describes two hours
of previously undescribed recordings and says they contain no
reference to any effort by Clinton or Jordan to have Ms. Lewinsky
lie about her relationship with the president.
The tapes are described by the magazine as bolstering the view
that Ms. Lewinsky was infatuated with the president but had been
cut off from access to him by autumn of last year.
Clinton's allies have long asserted that they expected the
revelation of further material from the tapes secretly made by
Linda Tripp, a former colleague of Ms. Lewinsky's at the Pentagon,
to be exculpatory.
That might not be far off, at least in the boxing world: Duva,
76, seems to be everywhere doing everything even though most of his
peers are long retired.
In a career that has spanned more than a half-century, he has
fought, trained, managed and promoted. And he's done it
successfully he's worked in some capacity with dozens of
champions and in a colorful manner all his own.
Last week, he joined the ranks of the greats in the sport: He
was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.
The son of Italian immigrants grew up in poverty in Paterson,
N.J., about 10 miles outside New York City. Between myriad jobs and
school, he had already begun fighting at around 12 years old in
back rooms of restaurants and bars and had a short, undistinguished
professional career. However, his niche was outside the ring.
At 16, after driving a truck all day to help make ends meet at
home, he would spend every free evening at Stillman's Gym in New
York. There, he would watch some of the world's best fighters work
out but pay particular attention to the trainers and schmooze with
the managers.
Since then, he has worked with such title holders as Evander
Holyfield and Pernell Whitaker and currently handles rising star
Fernando Vargas of Oxnard.
His family's promotional firm, Main Events, also is one of the
most successful boxing enterprises in the world. The family's first
big break was acquiring a piece of Leon Spinks in 1978 the year
he beat and then lost to Muhammad Ali and promoted the first Ray
Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight in 1981. It has been a major player
since.
