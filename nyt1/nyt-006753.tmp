The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people
with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would
stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational
programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city
residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs.
 The housing department is seeking $400 million for a new
Community Empowerment Fund, which would be used to leverage $2
billion in private-sector loans to create 280,000 jobs.
 The department is also requesting $283 milion in new
low-income housing vouchers to make it easier for 50,000 welfare
recipients to find a job.
 The Department of Education wants $1.5 billion over five years
to create Education Opportunity Zones in high poverty areas and
$7.3 billion over the same period to hire new teachers to reduce
the class size in grades 1 through 3.
SAN FRANCISCO As Tiger Woods attempted once again to grasp
that greatness that flashed across Augusta National 14 months ago,
the result was a peculiar mix Woods's demeanor was consistent,
even if his golf was far from it.
All was well, though. Woods seemed well on his way to a solid
round and a high rung on the leaderboard. And perhaps he might have
been well on his way toward winning his second major, a feat few in
golf thought would require a year-and-thensome, as now is the case,
since his epic triumph in the 1997 Masters.
Woods reached the ninth green in regulation two and was faced
with a 25-footer for birdie. But his round was to turn completely
here as Woods needed four putts to get off the green and an ungodly
three to traverse the final 2 feet. From that green onward, Woods
would play The Olympic Club in a far-from-great 6 over par.
Tiger used his driver on only three holes the first, 11th, and
17th but when he pulled his driver out on the 11th, he brought
out more than a few gasps from the crowd, driving the ball 290
yards down the fairway. Yet he could come home only with a par as
the greens mastered Woods this day instead of Woods mastering
Olympic, as had been expected by some because he played the
Lakeside Course many times as an undergraduate at nearby Stanford.
Back then, though, Woods could be a carefree college student.
Back then, Woods had not yet flashed across the sky with a stunning
and overwhelming win at the '97 Masters. Back then, Woods was
carrying merely the potential of greatness on his shoulders, not
the weight of greatness on demand.
But greatness cannot be demanded. On the 12th hole, a 416-yard
par 4, Woods found the right bunker and could not get up and down.
Bogey. On the next hole, a par 3, Woods three-putted from 24 feet
for another bogey, bogeys and worse being his nemesis in the majors
since the 1997 Masters. Woods has gone 26 strokes over par on 11
holes at various junctures of the 1997 US and British Opens, the
'97 PGA, and now the 1998 US Open.
