But the impulse to form new data networking alliances is not
Cisco's alone. Last week, the data-switch maker Tellabs announced
plans to acquire Ciena Corp., a high-flying supplier of a new
technology that vastly expands the capacity of fiber backbones, for
$7.5 billion.
And a day later, another digital switch maker, DSC
Communications, agreed to be acquired for $4.4 billion in stock by
Alcatel Alsthom of France a telecommunications equipment giant
that wants to expand its American presence.
So Cisco may find it increasingly difficult to steamroll the
competition. Last week, when Sprint announced plans for its
national network to evolve from circuit switching to packet
switching, attention centered on the fact that the key new pieces
of equipment for chopping voice, video and other data into
fixed-size packets would come from Cisco, and not from a
telecommunications vendor like Lucent.
But Cisco's gear, when ready, will only be found on the edge of
this new- era network. At its core will be data switches from the
Japanese giant NEC and, oh yes, from Nortel. 
NEW YORK The owner of a Brooklyn sweater factory who had
accused Liz Claiborne and the United States' leading
garment-industry union of conspiring to destroy his business has
died of a heart attack at his home in Monsey, according to his
lawyers.
Shraga Newhouse, 50 years old and the father of 10 children, was
the president and majority stockholder of Mademoiselle Knitwear.
The company filed a $90 million lawsuit last month against Liz
Claiborne and the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees, known as Unite.
The lawsuit contended that Claiborne had fraudulently schemed to
avoid a commitment to provide work to the Brooklyn company, which
filed for bankruptcy when Claiborne's orders stopped.
The lawsuit also contended that the union had participated in
that scheme by abandoning an arbitration claim it had filed against
Claiborne on behalf of Mademoiselle's workers; in exchange,
Mademoiselle said, the union got a new collective bargaining
agreement that required Claiborne to pay the union a minimum of $13
million.
A team of Rutgers University researchers hired by the New Jersey
government to examine the effects of the state's new welfare policy
found that it has contributed to an increase in abortions, but the
state has rejected the findings, and asked for revisions of the
report.
In a December report, commissioned by the state Department of
Human Services and the federal Department of Health and Human
Services and obtained by The New York Times, the Rutgers
researchers said the welfare overhaul provision known as the family
cap, which was enacted in 1992 and cuts off extra benefits from
welfare recipients who have additional children, has caused some
women to abort their pregnancies.
