President Clinton said on Friday that the impact of currency
instability on China played an important role in the decision by
United States authorities to intervene and support the value of the
yen last week.
China itself seems to have tried to bring about some coordinated
response on the decline of the yen and had publicly voiced concern
over the tumbling yen in the last two weeks.
In previous months, China had repeatedly pledged to the
international community that it would not devalue its currency to
support its exports. But as the yen tumbled in the last couple of
weeks, Dai Xianglong, China's central bank governor, suggested once
that China may be wavering in that commitment.
But some economists point out that it is also not fully in the
interests of China to devalue its currency because a game of
competitive devaluations would erode profits in China as well as
everywhere else. China, for instance, has a substantial amount of
loans in United States dollars, so that any devaluation would
immediately make those loans more expensive to pay back.
Partly for that reason, some economists have downplayed the role
that a potential Chinese currency devaluation played in the
decision last week by U.S. authorities to intervene to support the
yen.

 The average fee for a bounced check is now $21.36, up from
$20.80 last October, according to a March survey of 350 U.S. banks
by Bank Rate Monitor.
 Eight of the Top 10 banks charge noncustomers who use their
automated teller machines, and 55 percent of all U.S. banks impose
such surcharges, up from 48 percent in October.
 Late payment and over-the-limit fees on credit cards have each
jumped from an average of $13 to about $20 in just 18 months,
according to RAM Research.
Some big banks including Fleet, First Union and Mellon now
charge as much as $25 to close a credit card account. Others charge
a $15 dormancy fee on accounts that are inactive for six months. If
you get a cash advance on a credit card, expect to pay up to 5
percent of the withdrawn amount in fees.
