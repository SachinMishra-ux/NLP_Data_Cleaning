But the renowned Gallic sang-froid was severely tested last week
by a strike by pilots at Air France, the state-owned airline, just
days before the nation plays host to the World Cup, the World
Series of soccer.
The pilots, whose average annual salary of $123,000 makes them
better paid than their counterparts at other major European
carriers like Lufthansa and British Airways, were protesting a
management plan to trim their pay by an average of $26,000 over the
next three to five years, and replace the income with stock
options.
With Air France, the official carrier for the World Cup, able to
fly only a fraction of its schedule, the French public was
outraged, for the first time in years, by what many saw as greedy
pilots. A poll published by Paris-Match last week showed that only
47 percent of those polled supported holding a transportation
strike during the World Cup. In December 1995, 62 percent of those
surveyed sympathized with striking rail and transport workers; in
November 1996, 74 percent supported striking truck drivers.
Chevenement and Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin were
elected a year ago by voters who never forgave Jospin's
conservative predecessor, Alain Juppe, for trying to cut the
pension benefits of the rail and transit workers in 1995 as part of
an unpopular government austerity plan to prepare for the coming
single European currency. When strikers shut down rail and mass
transit networks, the country was paralyzed, but with Christmas
approaching many workers were just as happy to back the strikers
and stay home.
This time things were different. The irony of a Socialist-led
government criticizing strikers is only one of many contradictions
in the latest episode in France's struggle to pull its cosseted
welfare-state economy into the 21st century.
Chevenement even had to deny rumors that he was considering
calling in the French equivalent of the National Guard to replace
the strikers the way that President Ronald Reagan replaced striking
American air traffic controllers in the early 1980s.
The French feel as strongly about soccer as they do about social
justice. Taxpayers put up $450 million for a new stadium in Paris
for the World Cup, and Air France planes have been splashed with
bright color pictures of players from 32 countries. Buses in Paris
display welcome signs in many languages, and special trains have
been arranged to transport fans and players among the 10 cities in
which the 64 games will be played.
France's national honor is at stake, the authorities keep
reminding people. No American-style private-sector improvisation, a
la Atlanta during the last Olympics and Denver during the 1994
World Cup, would do for the glory of France.
With a sense that the eyes of the world were on them, many
French felt indignation when transportation unions started in with
business as usual by trying to hold up employers for ransom just
when their work was most needed.
The pilots were not the only ones on the picket lines, though
truck drivers, who shut down the country's roads in 1997 and the
year before to get higher wages, promised they wouldn't think of
inconveniencing their fellow citizens during the World Cup, which
ends July 12.
