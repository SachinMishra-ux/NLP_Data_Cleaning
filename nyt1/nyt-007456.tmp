The 6-11, 235-pound senior is considered the best power-forward
prospect. A two-time first-team All-America selection and Big 12
player of the year, he has impressed scouts with his soft,
left-handed touch and array of low-post moves that led to 19.8
points and 11.4 rebounds last season.
At 6-9 and 223 pounds, Jamison was simply too quick for college
forwards and averaged 22.2 points and 10.5 rebounds as a junior at
North Carolina last season. With pogo-stick jumping ability and a
cat-quick release on his shots, he was the nation's consensus
player of the year last season, joining only Michael Jordan as the
only Tar Heel to accomplish the feat.
While scouts rave about his aggressiveness, agility and knack
for being in the right place at the right time, they're confused as
to whether Jamison is a small forward or power forward.
With the Mavericks, Jamison could utilize his athleticism in
Nelson's up-tempo style and allow Finley to play his more natural
shooting guard position.
The Mavericks have long coveted the 19-year-old since watching
him average 20.9 points as a 6-5 freshman shooting guard at Saint
Louis last season. Though he averaged only 2.4 assists, took almost
17 shots per game and shot only 41 percent (29 percent on
3-pointers), scouts drool over his quick first step, ball-handling
skills, unlimited shooting range and ability to create his own shot
off the dribble.
Hughes, who scored 30 points seven times last season, could
eventually become the fast-breaking point guard Nelson desires. In
light of Robert Pack's injury-riddled season, Hughes would seem a
perfect fit in Dallas. Nelson, however, realizes the secret is out.
The SEC, which started the realignment raiding rage in 1992 when
it added Arkansas and South Carolina, finds itself standing in this
game of musical schools. To stay at 12, it has to invite a Big East
refugee or pluck an unripe school (Louisville?) from the expansion
vine.
Fictional whimsy, you say? Perhaps. But the previous five
paragraphs are closer to fact than fantasy. Why? I've heard
off-the-record whispers from a variety of people who think the Big
Ten is ready to round out its membership to a dozen. And its
primary target is Notre Dame.
Recently, Big Ten officials shrugged off a story out of Ann
Arbor, Mich., that had Notre Dame joining their league. There will
be more stories and speculation, but we won't know for sure until a
news conference is called. When and if that happens, the conference
alignment dominoes will start falling.
The Big Ten has been at 11 teams since Penn State joined in
1993. By adding a 12th team, the Big Ten could stage a conference
title game that could be worth $5 million to $7 million in
television rights fees.
