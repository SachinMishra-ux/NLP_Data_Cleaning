Their strike is about more than just the stamping equipment. It
is a culmination of watching the exodus of automotive jobs from not
only Flint and the rest of Michigan but the entire United States.
If the dispute isn't resolved quickly, it also has the potential
of disrupting one of the biggest vehicle launches in recent GM
history.
ATLANTA -- Comes now the 1998 Daewoo Leganza front-drive sedan,
wafting over from South Korea like some test balloon intended to
tell its launchers which way car sales are blowing and to locate
hot spots.
The Leganza, a comfortable enough four-door with exterior lines
and trim vaguely reminiscent of Chrysler/General Motors cars, is
one of three models due here from Daewoo.
The multi-industrial firm, which reports its sales last year
totaled $68 billion, also plans to bring in a 1.6-liter-engined
Lanos coupe and sedan and a 2.0-liter-engined Nubira coupe and
sedan.
Prices aren't firm. Daewoo says the Leganza will range from
$15,000 to $20,000, while the smaller Nubira will be in the
$12,000-$14,000 range and the subcompact Lanos in the
$9,000-$12,000 range. It's difficult to imagine the fully equipped
test Leganza -- silver with a two-tone brown interior set off by
faux wood trim -- rolling out of a showroom for less than $22,000.
Daewoo's Los Angeles-based publicity firm says July will find
the cars in 14 major markets, although a site for the company-owned
showroom in Atlanta has not been announced. (Calls to Daewoo's
offices in Compton, Calif., were not returned.)
The test vehicle made it obvious that pricing will be a vital
factor in the Leganza's acceptance or dismissal in the highly
competitive family sedan market. Positives include the power/luxury
features, a willingness to run stably with I-285 traffic and
reasonable fuel mileage (about 25 mpg combined). Negatives include
some awkward controls, including those for the high-end stereo, and
Daewoo's lack of a track record (It has helped build some General
Motors vehicles, including the Pontiac LeMans).
The tester's appointments were fine, with quality cloth,
visually acceptable plastic, the expected amenities and some
convenience pluses: drink holders, storage spaces, plenty of vents,
big outside mirrors and a split fold-down rear seat.
The 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine is rated at 131 horsepower,
and that seemed very realistic. The test Leganza's motor
occasionally required restarting if cold and sometimes seemed to
have a bad relationship with the four-speed automatic transmission,
resulting in some gear-hunting and unexpected kick-downs. It's not
a quiet power plant, but how many four-cylinders really are hushed?
