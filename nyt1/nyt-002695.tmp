Indeed, it's become a common refrain for women to say they've
been threatened with losing their children if they don't cooperate,
defense lawyers say.
Deputy District Attorney Pam Booth, who heads the DA's office in
nearby El Monte, said her office alerts the county's Department of
Children's Services whenever a child is directly involved or
witnesses an act of domestic violence. It's up to DCS to open an
investigation, she said.
Deputy Public Defender Robin Berkovitz cited a recent Downtown
case where her client was charged with threatening his former
girlfriend with a gun. The woman later recanted, saying she was
jealous to see her boyfriend with another man.
The woman took the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination at
a preliminary hearing, preventing Berkovitz from being able to
question her on the stand. Her client later pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor and served 120 days in jail.
The woman's presence at trial isn't always vital for a
conviction, especially with a new law that permits a jury to hear
certain statements a woman made to police but who then is
unavailable to testify. The law was passed in response to the
Simpson case.
Still, in some cases prosecutors or judges decide the victim
needs to be in court. A woman's presence is often important in
misdemeanor cases where police don't have any independent proof of
physical injury.
Such was the case at the trial of Luis Manuel Roman the one in
which Martinez was the star witness. In January, police arrested
Roman in Tujunga after Martinez called 911. Roman is the father of
three of Martinez's children. He was on probation for hitting her
in 1996.
In the latest incident, police say Martinez told them Roman hit
her several times, according to Deputy City Attorney Jose Egurbide,
who prosecuted the case. She had no bruises or other signs of
injury, Egurbide said.
Last week, Martinez said she never told police he hit her. She
said she called 911 because the argument was getting heated and she
wanted him out of the house.
Egurbide notes that Martinez also tried to change her story in
1996. He said he never threatened her, he simply advised her she
might need her own lawyer.
