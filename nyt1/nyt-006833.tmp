Before the shooting, Meyer had been removed from patrol duty and
assigned to the Police Department's maintenance section. Seven
complaints have been filed against him with the Civilian Complaint
Review Board and a $100 million civil suit is pending against him
in federal court in Brooklyn. But Meyer, who comes from a family of
police officers, had a number of commendations and medals for
valor.
Thursday, Reid's family announced that they planned to file a
$100 million civil suit against Meyer and the city of New York.
Their lawyers said the city was negligent because it knew of the
allegations of brutality against the officer but did not take away
his service pistol. That gun, a 9-mm semiautomatic, was used in the
shooting, the police said.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir has said he had no reason to
take away Meyer's gun because none of the complaints against him
pertained to the use of a firearm.
Major league baseball's odd, and seemingly never-ending, pursuit
of Bud Selig for the position of commissioner has come to an end.
Club owners have finally snared the man who insisted he would not
run if asked and not serve if elected.
Selig, according to high-ranking officials in baseball, will
soon officially be dubbed what he always was the man most wanted
by his fellow owners. According to those in the know, the promotion
from mere club owner and interim commissioner to full-time overseer
of his sport should come at or soon after the all-star break next
month, despite Selig's contention Thursday that talk of such a move
was premature.
It will be Selig's greatest challenge not only to figure out all
the required steps, but discern how to not stumble while attempting
the saber dance that has skewered the careers of the most
well-intentioned office-holders. For baseball's highest office
remains so many things to so many people that it is the most
fatally flawed of all such professional sports posts.
The baseball commissioner, similar yet unlike the commissioners
for football, basketball and hockey, is asked to be more than just
a chief executive officer. Rather, he must also be a moral
barometer, public icon, baby sitter, judge and jury, referee,
public punching bag, chief bottle washer and, alas, unwitting pawn,
as commishes too often find out in times of labor strife. Despite
donning all these hats, baseball's top guy is never perceived to be
as effective as, say, Pete Rozelle was when running the National
Football League or David Stern is as he shares the National
Basketball Association with Michael Jordan.
Alas, baseball's commissioner is rarely ever as powerful as
those other commissioners, and, embarrassingly, the pretense comes
at times when only potency is needed. That baseball's commissioner
is nonetheless viewed as being all things to all people renders the
office impossible and the situation winless, as most every
commissioners who preceded Selig would attest.
All that usually remains are calls to reform the office and
redefine the way baseball is run. And, of course, the
never-changing expectations that usually do in the commissioners
with the best of intentions.
Surprisingly, expectations are also a constant with owners,
players and umpires, all of whom should know better since they,
more than any other, are the first to encourage a commissioner to
do the job only to fillet the man for taking up the challenge. One
can almost sense the no-win tag being printed even before Selig's
contract negotiations are complete.
