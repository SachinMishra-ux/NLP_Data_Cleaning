The social conservatives in the Republican Party are finding it
increasingly hard to get on with the economic conservatives, and
the historic marriage which Reagan helped to forge between them and
the moderates is on the rocks.
Bauer and Dobson in particular are less interested in the free
market than in morality, and have sparked angry words from the
other side.
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle PARIS This was the year, Lindsay Davenport promised herself. This
was the year she would get stronger, faster and meaner. She would
lose weight and acquire an attitude.
No more Miss Nice Girl, Lindsay said, gritting her teeth and
snarling. She would light a fire in her belly, and shrink same a
bit. She would focus her appetite on winning championships, not her
next meal.
Davenport botched a grand opportunity in the French Open
semifinals Thursday, although her opponent, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, a fast-fading clay-court diva in recent months, knows
Court Central at Roland Garros as well as anybody on the women's
tour. The tenacious little Spaniard, a two-time winner here, always
has been as gritty as the clay under her feet, the antithesis of
Madam Davenport.
But Lindsay is improving. Formerly soft and gawky, and weak
mentally, she has at once slimmed down and grown into her 6-3
frame. Through a hellish training regimen and the normal maturing
process, she has become enough of a force to have risen, albeit
quietly, to No. 2 in the world rankings at the age of 21.
For now, for at least until the Williams posse reaches full
tennis flower, Davenport can stand tall proudly, literally and
figuratively, as the best American-born player going. (As of later
Thursday afternoon, it became painfully clear who the top American
player, period, is once again.)
Davenport is also the reigning Olympic champion, having beaten
Sanchez Vicario for the gold medal in Atlanta in 1996. They never
can take that away from her. Nonetheless, she's still too slow and
too nice, if no longer too, uh, chubby.
Sanchez Vicario exploited Davenport's weaknesses on both fronts,
winning 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in a mistake-filled 94-minute match that
featured twice as many dreadful moments as delightful ones. If
Monica Seles' return to the Roland Garros final was a tour de
force, the Sanchez Vicario-Davenport undercard was more of a tour
de farce.
Had Davenport's match gone on second, though, she might have
drawn inspiration from the whupping Seles put on top-ranked and
top-seeded Martina Hingis. Seles, whose own post-stabbing battle of
the bulge has been excruciatingly chronicled, knocked every bit of
swagger from the self-confident countenance of the 17-year-old
Swiss phenom in arguably the most satisfying victory of her
tragically split career.
