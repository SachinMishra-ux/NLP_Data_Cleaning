FEDERAL-DEBTS WASHINGTON A federal program that was supposed
to help collect debts that are owed the government has cost $40
million but brought in only $4 million, lawmakers complained at a
House oversight hearing Friday. Treasury officials offered few
assurances that they could make a big dent in the $52 billion in
non-tax related debts owed the U.S. (Malone, Cox News Service 500).
YORKTOWN-SURVIVORS WASHINGTON While ocean explorers from the
National Geographic Society were presenting a remote-control video
tour of the American aircraft carrier U.S.S. Yorktown this week,
survivors of the ship toured their memories of the bedlam of a
major sea battle. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 1000).
CHURCH WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. How has the Catholic Church's
response to priest misdeeds changed over the years and why? More
attempts are being made to come clean quickly. We'll include the
historic perspective, perhaps a box on several cases and how they
were handled; and mention the existence of the Maryland facility
for deviant priests. We also will include the numbers perspective it's still a rare case when priests do things like this. (Moffett,
Palm Beach Post) . (developing)
WASHINGTON Despite reforms of its debt-collection methods, the
federal government has a backlog of $52 billion in delinquent debts
that spurred bipartisan complaints Friday from members of Congress.
Under the new measure, Treasury has extended powers and
government-wide responsibility for collecting debts that are more
than 180 days tardy, including student loans, farm and business
loans, and federally backed home mortgages.
However, federal agencies have been slow to refer their debts to
Treasury until they have become so old as to be deemed
uncollectible.
The law also authorizes automatic deductions from federal
salaries or federal benefits for anyone who has a delinquent debt.
But little of this has taken effect, since it depends on developing
a new computer program. Treasury spent $5 million on such a
program, which proved defective and has now been abandoned.
