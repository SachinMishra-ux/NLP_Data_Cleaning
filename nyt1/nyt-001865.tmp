Although the mass of the neutrino of any flavor must be small,
Totsuka said, it may be several electron-volts, and if so, the
overall gravitational effect on the universe would perhaps be
significant. It has been estimated that at any given moment, every
teaspoon worth of volume of space throughout the universe contains
an average of 300 neutrinos, so their aggregate number is
staggering.
Representatives of dozens of neutrino experiments meet once
every two years to exchange ideas at conferences like the one under
way here. Present are representatives of teams that have installed
neutrino detectors on the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia, under
the Aegean Sea off the Greek coast, inside the Gran Sasso tunnel
under the Alps, under the ice covering the South Pole, and in many
other places.
LOS ANGELES -- For all of its 20-year history, blood products
specialist HemaCare Corp. has operated in the shadow of the
American Red Cross, struggling in the role of David to the Red
Cross' Goliath.
Now, in an apparent effort to even the playing field, HemaCare's
board of directors has hired a Red Cross insider to serve as chief
executive.
After a year in which the company saw essentially zero earnings
on stagnant sales of $11 million, William Nicely, former chief
executive for the Red Cross' Southern California blood services
division, was brought in Monday with a mandate to cut costs,
improve efficiency and drum up new business. In the process, the
board hopes, he will help bolster the company's anemic shares.
It's a deceptively simple list, Nicely said, and one for which
he is under the gun to devise a strategy. HemaCare's board will
meet June 29, and Nicely must make his recommendations then.
HemaCare was founded in 1978 to make money at what had
traditionally been a nonprofit business: the collection of blood
and blood components for resale to Southern California hospitals.
By emphasizing its small size relative to the Red Cross, and
putting a premium on customer service, HemaCare met with some
success, enough at least to go public in 1986. By 1992 the firm was
generating $12.4 million in annual sales. Earnings were harder to
come by, however, and from 1992 to 1994 the company lost money in
every quarter but one.
Part of the problem was a lack of focus. Over the years,
HemaCare dabbled in several money-losing projects, including
research on an alternative treatment for HIV infection and the
establishment of a blood services center in St. Louis.
Each of the endeavors was subsequently scrapped, leaving
HemaCare wiser but poorer, with only the business of collecting and
distributing blood to fall back on. But a back-to-basics strategy
based on those operations may simply not be enough to turn the
company around now, analysts say.
