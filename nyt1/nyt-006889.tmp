In a major move rearranging the Web's power structure, The Walt
Disney Co. announced Thursday it is buying what will turn into a
controlling interest of one the most popular Internet search
companies in a deal valued at nearly $500 million.
Disney officials say they will use the Internet might of
Infoseek and Disney's strongest assets which include such
powerhouse brands as ABC and ESPN, its theme parks and characters to attract the hundreds of millions of people not already online.
Analysts said that far more than any other Internet player,
Disney can successfully market the idea of easy Web access to
nontechies, including the advertising-attractive group of parents
who trust the Disney name but aren't Internet-savvy yet.
The deal will put Disney in competition on at least one front
with Internet companies such as America Online and Yahoo! that also
are building content on the World Wide Web, currently used by about
50 million people. But where AOL also serves as an Internet service
provider, giving customers a local telephone number through which
they can access AOL and the Internet, Disney is just offering sites albeit, well-branded sites to visit once someone is online.
Then again, with cable and telephone companies working
feverishly to bring the Internet into every home, Disney doesn't
have to offer connection service. After all, Disney attracts
millions of moviegoers but doesn't own any theater chains.
The deals reinforce the view that traditional media companies
will have to partner with Internet specialists rather than build
Web portals from scratch if they are to achieve significant
recognition among current and future Internet users.
Thursday's deal was just the latest agreement between a
mainstream media company and an Internet firm. Disney formed an
alliance two weeks ago with Excite, providing easy access to
Disney's sites, and NBC last week paid $32 million for a minority
investment in Internet specialist CNET and its Snap! directory
service.
Shares of Infoseek had risen nearly 50 percent in the past three
weeks as takeover rumors lifted most Internet stocks. Infoseek
shares gained 62.5 cents to $35.125 after hitting $42 during the
session while Disney lost 2 5/16 to $112.
The $496 million deal calls for Disney to obtain a 43 percent
stake in Infoseek in exchange for Disney's ownership position in
Starwave Corp. which develops Disney's Internet sites plus $70
million cash.
Analysts believe the entertainment giant is in the right place
at the right time even though profits won't show up on the bottom
line immediately.
