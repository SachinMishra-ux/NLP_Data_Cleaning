The book, which the mayor dedicates to his mother, Helen
Giuliani, was written and illustrated by Kristin Doney, 31, a
children's-book illustrator who lives in Greenwich Village.
The book was published by New York City Public/Private
Initiatives Inc., a private group headed by Tamra Roberts Lhota,
the wife of the mayor's budget director, Joseph Lhota. The book was
made possible in part by a $25,000 grant from Goldman, Sachs Co.
The mayor's office said copies would be donated to all elementary
school libraries and all branches of the New York Public Library.
The mayor said 10,000 copies were in print, but he expected at
least twice as many to be distributed ultimately.
NEW YORK Four teen-age boys who are accused of sending lewd
notes threatening violence against certain teachers and students at
a Brooklyn high school earlier this week have been arrested, school
and police officials said Thursday.
The four boys, all juniors at Canarsie High School, were charged
with aggravated harassment, a misdemeanor, and issued desk
appearance tickets. Three of the boys, arrested late Wednesday
night, were identified as Weygand Gardner, Jesse Prendess and
Lonnie McNeill, all 17. A fourth boy, Adrian Mair, 16, was arrested
Thursday. The police are looking for two other suspects, who are
also students at the school.
Canarsie High was closed Thursday in observation of
Brooklyn-Queens Day. When classes resume Friday, the boys accused
of making the threats will likely be suspended for a maximum of 30
days, a Board of Education spokesman, J.D. LaRock, said.
School safety officers and the police interviewed those named in
the notes and scoured the school building, which was already
equipped with metal detectors, for weapons. Two of the three notes
were sent from America Online accounts; LaRock said it was not
clear whether the third was e-mail or just a note written on a
computer. None appeared to have been generated on a school
computer, he added.
CHICAGO Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
