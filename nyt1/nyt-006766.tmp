WALDO, Fla. Firefighting teams labored through yet another day
of relentless heat and roaring flames, and somehow managed to avert
major damage to homes and businesses as the Florida wildfire crisis
continued Thursday.
Flames bedeviled areas of Jacksonville's west side and flared up
as far south as Brevard County, near Kennedy Space Center. Fires
also continued raging in Charlton County, Ga., just north of the
state line, where some 9,000 acres of timberland have burned near
the town of St. George.
Weather forecasters offered little hope of improved conditions,
predicting that rain would come only in quick, scattered showers
for the next few days.
In the rural town of Waldo, about 15 miles northeast of
Gainesville, city officials Thursday maintained the evacuation
ordered Wednesday afternoon when flames crept to within 20 feet of
several homes.
Firefighters were helped a little bit Thursday because winds
stayed relatively calm. Earlier in the week, brisk westerly breezes
fanned the flames, making conditions much more tricky and
dangerous. There also were scattered thunderstorms in the area late
Thursday.
Although most of the flames have been concentrated in sparsely
populated rural areas, the fires have sent a thick cloud of hazy
smoke over large portions of North and Central Florida. Health
officials are warning people with respiratory problems to remain
indoors with their air conditioners running.
While most of the fires are at least 20 to 25 miles inland from
the state's Atlantic beaches, the smoke extended to within a few
miles of the ocean in some spots. Afternoon sea breezes helped push
the smoke back inland.
Tourism officials in Jacksonville reported a few concerned calls
from people planning to come to their area on vacation. The callers
were assured that the beaches and golf courses have not been
affected by the fires, said Kitty Ratcliffe, president of the
Jacksonville and the Beaches Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The fires have burned across Florida since Memorial Day,
consuming more than 40,000 acres, injuring 13 firefighters and
killing one person. Nearly 80 homes have burned or sustained
damage. Most parts of the state have received no significant
rainfall since March.
