Horrible carnage aside, one of the scariest circumstances in
this tale is the matter-of-fact disposition of what is, or should
be, a most serious crime carrying a gun on a school campus.
In Kinkel's case it was two crimes, possession and theft by
receiving. And yet he went home. I'm trying to imagine an adult
offender who, having been charged with two felonies, could expect
to be home by dinner.
This brings up the fact that many rural counties don't even have
juvenile detention centers. (That wasn't a factor in the Kinkel
case. Springfield had that option available for him.) In too many
cases, because those counties can't afford juvenile detention sites
or can't find a place to have offenders detained, kids like Kip go
home.
Currently a bill in Congress seeks to put an imprint on juvenile
justice that sounds tough but would backfire. One controversial
ingredient would allow local governments to house young offenders
in jails, abolishing a standard that for 24 years has kept young
offenders and older ones apart.
This is portrayed as a get-serious approach to juvenile crime.
Actually it is an incentive for local governments to keep doing
things as cheaply as possible and to not make needed investments in
juvenile detention, probation and counseling.
What would happen in such a tightwad community in the case of
Kip Kinkel? Sure, you want to be tough with serious, hardened
juvenile offenders. But you'd be reluctant to put a first-timer, an
All-American, freckle-faced kid with good parents, behind jailhouse
bars.

GLASS-COLUMN WASHINGTON Regarding India, George Tenet, the
nation's spy chief, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he
would try to do better. One way to start is to have some of the
folks who deal with the region, home to a fifth of the world's
people, bookmark the Times of India newspaper on their Internet
browsers. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED.
