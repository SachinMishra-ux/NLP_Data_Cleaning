If you were to shift the IRA money that's now in Vanguard
Wellington to a conservative all-stock fund such as Vanguard Index
Value, it would boost the equity side of the portfolio to a little
more than 39 percent, and would not have a terribly significant
effect on the yield from the holding a reduction of $1,059 at
current rates.
As for whether it's risky to have all your portfolio with
Vanguard, I think you have very little to worry about. Each of the
separate funds is its own business entity, with its assets held
apart from those of the parent company or other funds in the
family.
Whatever might happen to any one fund, or to the parent company
itself, would have no effect on the financial stability of any
other fund. And second, given Vanguard's fundamental conservatism
and stingy habits when it comes to spending money, I see very
little prospect of any trouble ahead.

SEOUL, South Korea Fourteen years ago, Kim Dae-jung was a
pro-democracy activist living in exile in Washington, struggling
with his English and with American officials who saw him as a pest.
When President Kim of South Korea returns to the United States
for a nine-day state visit beginning Saturday, he will get better
treatment. This time he is to stay in Washington at Blair House,
the American government's official guest residence, and address a
joint session of Congress.
Kim, the onetime dissident who became South Korea's president in
February, will also get a state dinner at the White House, receive
a human rights award and pick up an honorary degree at Georgetown
University.
Kim has indeed lived long he is 74 and he credits his
survival in part to American intervention when Korean dictators
planned to kill him. That makes his state visit an especially
poignant moment, diplomats and Korean officials say.
Still, Kim acknowledged that in some respects he is now in the
position of the officials who fended him off when he was a
dissident. Asked if he sometimes faces a choice between his moral
principles and the dictates of statecraft, when he ponders whether
to speak out on issues like human rights in China, Kim nodded.
These days, Kim has emerged to some extent as a spokesman for
the region and not just his country. The state visit to America
will add to his stature and to this regional leadership role, a
role that he seems to relish.
