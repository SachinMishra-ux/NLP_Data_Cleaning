Hotelling wants the city to zone Cannery Row as a historic
district, so that new construction would be considered against the
historic value of existing structures. He would also like to see
several of the large empty lots on the row filled with new
buildings, to bring back the original sense of the row a long
continuous strip of businesses along the seaside.
In the meantime, he and other preservationists want to save
several important structures from demolition. One is Stohan's
Gallery, a small arts and crafts gallery built in the 1940s as a
fish-processing plant, which was bought by developers last year.
Daryl Stokes, 48, who ran Stohan's for 20 years before he was
evicted last October to make way for development, said that in that
time he has seen about 40 percent of the strip replaced with new
development.
On another blazing, draining day, with the temperature 98
degrees in the stands and 114 on the track, Jones, a 22-year-old
Californian, won her third national title in two days as the U.S.
outdoor track and field championships ended Sunday.
Jones won the 100 meters and the long jump on Saturday night and
the 200 meters Sunday. In the 200, she downshifted in the last 15
meters and still won by 6 meters in 22.24 seconds into a slight
wind.
Then she smiled, relieved that she had completed the first
100-200-long jump triple in women's competition in the nationals
since Stella Walsh did it 50 years ago. In men's competition, the
last to do it was Carl Lewis in 1983.
Jackie is Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has won Olympic gold medals
in the heptathlon and the long jump. She did not compete here but
plans to be in the Goodwill Games next month in Uniondale, N.Y.
Jones will be there, too, in the 100 and 200.
Jones was voted the outstanding female athlete of the
championships. The men's honor went to John Godina, who on Saturday
night completed the men's first discus throw-shot-put double in 43
years.
The best performance of the meet came Sunday afternoon before a
crowd of 6,826 at Tad Gormley Stadium. Bryan Bronson, a 25-year-old
Rice graduate, won the men's 400-meter hurdles by 6 meters in 47.03
seconds. That was the fastest ever on American soil and the third
fastest in history behind Kevin Young's 46.78 in 1992 and Edwin
Moses' 47.02 in 1983.
In a meet limited to U.S. citizens, Bronson and three others ran
the fastest times in the world this year. The others were Kim
Batten in the women's 400-meter hurdles (53.61 seconds), Jerome
Young in the men's 400-meter dash (44.09 seconds) and Reggie Torian
in the men's 110-meter hurdles (13.03 seconds). Young, a surprise
winner, is a junior at St. Augustine's, a Division II college in
Raleigh, N.C.
