Hynes has always presented himself as a politician who is
disgusted by the pandering of other politicians. He said his
remarks against the death penalty while he pursues it in court are
consistent with a frankness that he believes voters want.
However well his approach has worked in Brooklyn, for years his
apparent frustration at being unable to move beyond the district
attorney's office has been a constant of New York politics.
He took office after becoming a political celebrity in the 1970s
and '80s. He was a special prosecutor in cases of nursing-home
fraud and political corruption. He had well-placed political
friends and was once New York City fire commissioner.
As special prosecutor in the 1986 Howard Beach racial killing
cases, he achieved widespread fame, with books written about him
and a television movie in which he was played by Daniel Travanti.
His ambitions have long been the subject of speculation. He was
often mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor or governor and
ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general twice, in 1978 and
1994.
Critics have suggested that his stance on the death penalty was
intended to try to ensure that his longtime opposition would not
become a roadblock to higher office.
In the interview, he conceded that at 63, he is probably running
his last campaign for statewide office.

O'Donnell was host.
The Manhattan Theater Club's announcement drew ire from
playwrights and other theater professionals and the company
reinstated the play, which mixes themes of Christianity and
homosexuality.
