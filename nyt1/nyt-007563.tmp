Reyes allowed a three-run homer to Ellis Burks in the fourth and
was lucky it wasn't worse. Mondesi took a three-run shot away from
Vinny Castilla in the first inning with a leaping catch at the
wall.
But Reyes' erratic performance put pressure on the young Dodgers
lineup that included Paul Konerko at third, Roger Cedeno in left
and Juan Castro at second.
Cedeno had two hits and an RBI, and Castro scored twice. But
Konerko went 0 for 4. Overall, the team had six players on the
roster with a year or less major-league experience.
The victory went to former Dodgers left-hander Mike Munoz (1-0),
the second of five Rockies relievers to pitch after starter John
Thomson was scratched because of a blister on his right middle
finger.
The Dodgers actually scored first when Cedeno's third-inning
single scored Castro. But Burks came back in the fourth with a
433-foot drive deep into the left-field bleachers for his 13th
homer.
Jim Bruske came on and got buried. The worst of it was an RBI
single by Burks, a run-scoring double by Greg Colbrunn and a
two-run single by Mike Lansing.
The Dodgers cut the lead to 7-5 in the seventh with a three-run
double by Karros, who has two homers and nine RBI in the series.
One of the runners was rookie Matt Luke, who had a pinch single off
Curtis Leskanic in his first at-bat since rejoining the club
earlier in the day.
Luke played 33 games for the Dodgers before being designated for
assignment May 29. He was claimed by Cleveland and had two pinch
at-bats before being designated again June 9.
The Rockies went into the ninth with right-hander Jerry DiPoto,
who allowed a game-winning homer to Karros the night before.
DiPoto allowed an RBI double to Gary Sheffield and Dave Veres
was brought in to face Karros with the tying run at second.
