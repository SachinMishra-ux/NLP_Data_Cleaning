For one thing, the penalty is hardly universal. While more than
20 million couples paid more in taxes in 1996 than they would have
if they were single, 25 million couples got a marriage bonus: They
paid less as a couple than they would have if they were single.
Most of the bonuses already go to the very families that social
conservatives consider the most traditional those in which the
husband works and the wife stays home. That is because the husband
would be entitled to more exemptions and deductions than he got
when he was single. For 1996, total bonuses of $32.9 billion, or
$1,300 per couple, outweighed total penalties of $28.8 billion, or
$1,380 per couple, by $4.1 billion.
Moreover, substantially reducing or eliminating the penalty
without raising taxes elsewhere would cost the federal government
at least $20 billion a year.
And while social conservatives want to allocate as much money as
possible to reducing the penalty, business groups and supply-side
Republicans and economists are queasy about allowing the issue to
crowd out cuts in other areas, like income tax rates, capital gains
taxes and inheritance taxes. Cuts that target a specific group are
considered by many economists to be an inefficient way of promoting
economic growth.
Perhaps most fundamentally, lawmakers have long found it
difficult to address the marriage penalty without creating some
other perceived inequity. Most of the proposals would do nothing
for single people. Most of the proposed fixes would also give more
help to people at the top of the income scale than those at the
bottom.
And some of the proposals would complicate the problem by
levying different amounts of taxes on couples with the same
combined incomes.
The current law is the product of decades of swings in policy
and public opinion about how to treat the income of married couples
in a way that is fair to two-income families, single-earner
couples, unmarried people and people across the income spectrum.
When the federal income tax was established in 1913, it was
levied on individuals, with no special provision made for married
couples. Starting in the 1920s, when relatively few married women
worked, some states passed laws allowing married couples to split
their income and pay at a lower rate than the husband would if he
had to file as an individual.
In 1948, Congress responded by changing the law to allow joint
filing, widening tax brackets enough that most married couples paid
less than if they were single.
Soon protests about the marriage penalty were heard. Best known
of the protesters were David and Angela Boyter, federal employees
from Baltimore who would divorce for tax purposes each December and
then remarry early in the new year to reduce their taxes. Congress
responded by creating a two-earner deduction in 1981.
