His reputation preceded him to Arkansas, where he was favored in
the Oaklawn Handicap but ran fourth. A confidence-building victory
against cheaper horses last time out set him up for The
Californian, a $250,000 race whose 45 winners include 10 national
champions.
Mud Route ($3.80), once a speedball, stalked Worldly Ways for
most of the 1[-mile race. Deputy Commander, trying to find his
Travers- and Super Derby-winning form and carrying six pounds more
than the field, came wide and finished 2{ lengths in front of
third-place Worldly Ways.
Later Sunday, McCarron and McAnally teamed up again to win the
$150,000 Estrapade Stakes on the turf with late-running Proud
Fillie ($5.40). 
NEW YORK The media turned out in force at St. Patrick's
Cathedral on Sunday, anticipating yet another in what has lately
been a series of public pronouncements by Cardinal John O'Connor on
issues like Little League play on Sundays and domestic partnership
legislation. Perhaps he would weigh in on Terrence McNally's
controversial new play, or comment on some other pressing social
issue.
The cardinal, however, stayed focused on Sunday's confirmation
Mass for 25 Catholics with severe disabilities although he did
manage to find a few opportunities to tweak the assembled
reporters.
No precautions were taken on Sunday morning beyond the several
police officers who are always on hand for Sunday Masses at St.
Patrick's. The cardinal, a former Navy chaplain, was unfazed by the
threat, said his spokesman, Joseph Zwilling.
BAY HEAD, N.J. Residents of this wealthy seaside community
reacted Sunday with a mix of sympathy and flippancy as they learned
that 22 Chinese immigrants landed here on Saturday night.
By early Sunday afternoon, after the Oops II had been towed from
the beach, residents and tourists who stayed behind were doing
their best to come up with a good rumor to explain its arrival.
SLOATSBURG, N.Y. The law people cite most often in this
village these days is the one that says precisely what kind of
housing is allowed: single-family houses on lots of 40,000 square
feet, single-family houses on 30,000 square feet, single-family
houses on 15,000 square feet and single-family houses on 10,000
square feet. Period.
They are trying to derail a plan by Mayor Samuel Abate to bring
the first multifamily housing to a village filled with people who
came here to get away from the very idea.
