The Dodgers were hoping to think only about the home runs by
Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros or the three RBI by Paul Konerko.
They took two of three against the Mariners and had a good chance
to make up some ground in the National League West by playing three
games this week against the lowly Oakland A's.
But as the plane was warming up so was the bullpen. And suddenly
the Dodgers' six-run lead started to shrink. Ken Griffey Jr. hit a
two-run homer off Mark Guthrie, who then gave up a single and a
walk. Scott Radinsky was no better, facing two batters, walking one
and allowing a hit to load the bases.
That Osuna struck out Segui on a 2-2 fastball to end the game is
only part of the story. If Osuna hadn't struggled all season,
Guthrie and Radinsky would never have been in the game.
It certainly is no longer Radinsky, who took over the closer
role when Osuna faltered. He didn't get a blown save the way he did
twice at home against Cincinnati, but he has allowed 12 of the last
20 batters he's faced to reach base (nine hits, three walks).
But Russell knows that Osuna, like Radinsky, is a one-pitch
fastball pitcher. Osuna has more velocity, Radinsky more movement.
Neither has been consistent and hitters have adjusted. Radinsky had
10 saves in his first 11 attempts, but just one in his past four.
That confidence had been shattered early this year when Osuna
came out of spring training with a new three-year contract but
without control. He left the team for several days in early May
when his father became ill in Mexico.
With 62 down, and 100 games to play, the Dodgers (31-31) need
him to step up.
Dreifort (4-5) certainly has done his share, winning for the
fourth time in five starts. He struck out Griffey three times, the
first time that has happened this year. Dreifort allowed nine hits
but was helped by two of the Dodgers' three double plays.
Last Thursday, the Dodgers refused to trade Dreifort to the
Mariners as part of the Randy Johnson deal. Sunday he showed why he
might be worth it.
Dreifort was given the lead on a first-inning homer by Sheffield
and a fourth-inning blast by Karros, both off Mariners starter
Jamie Moyer (3-6).
