I was waiting along the first fairway for Tiger when Daly's ball
landed nearby. He leaned on his club and lit up a ciggy. When it
was time to hit, he crushed it on the fairway. His caddy picked up
the butt.
Those are the kinds of details you see watching golf in person
that you'll never see on television.
Oh, the power of this sport. The player in question put his
glove back on, leading to follow-up glove analysis.
Some advice if you're going on safari with Tiger this weekend.
Just do it briefly. It's great to see him up close, but you only
see parts of him between heads, under visors and around carefully
bobbed hair.
There has to be more to watching golf than that. Don't ask me. I
only saw Tiger once close up, and never did see him sink a putt. I
assume he did.
DEAR DR. BOMBAY: In a recent conversation with tech support, I
discovered new laws of physics. The dilemma was over whether a
CD-ROM drive was broken or whether a game was at fault. The tech
support person told me that since the back of my CD was
gold-colored, that was the problem. He said it was not
industry-standard silver. I accepted this politely even though I
knew it was a lie.
DEAR PEEVED: Now that's what's wrong with the relationship
between the computer industry and consumers. You were willing to
just roll over and accept any load of fertilizer they handed you.
To clear things up, it doesn't matter that your CD was gold. The
little laser thingie that shines on its surface is looking for
microscopic holes in the reflective surface, and it could care less
about colors. Take a look at a recordable CD. Guess what color it
is.
DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there any way somebody can find out that I
trade adult pictures with people I meet on America Online?
DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What does one do with old CD-ROM programs? I'd
hate to just trash them.
