But there's a cult level to NBA lore, stories barely remembered
and seldom told. They are the unopened volumes, telling the real
story, and they center entirely around defense.
In that ridiculous 42-point rout of Utah, the Chicago Bulls set
a team-wide offensive standard they won't be able to match. Not in
this series, maybe not ever if Jordan sails into the sunset. Nobody
could miss, not even Jud Buechler. Bill Wennington was a heck of an
option. Even Dickey Simpkins put one down. It was bawdy, comical
and completely unrealistic.
But what's happening inside the Jazz players' heads? How does it
feel knowing that they can't execute their offense, that they can't
set the tough screens, that a 6-for-6 start by Karl Malone means
absolutely nothing?
Sloan glanced at a copy of the final boxscore, a surrealistic
set of numbers showing seven turnovers by Malone, 30 percent
shooting by the Jazz, a combined two points by John Stockton and
Howard Eisley, and the 96-54 final.
No team in the history of the 24-second shot clock had scored
fewer points. Not just in the Finals or the playoffs, but in any game. The plodding beasts of the mid-50s did better than this. It
was also the most one-sided game ever witnessed in the Finals.
Center Greg Foster was seething. Where he comes from, the hard
streets of Oakland high school ball, you don't lose a game this way
without losing some pride, as well.
Stockton looked positively helpless, shooting 1-for-4 and never
getting to the free-throw line. Malone broke from the gate like a
cooped-up thoroughbred, but he was a different man after Rodman
entered the game. At the time, he was on a 5-for-5 roll. For the
rest of the first half nearly 15 minutes' worth Malone took
only two shots.
And that's the hidden legacy of the Bulls. Occasionally through
time, a defensive play will stand out, like the great Boston Garden
steals by John Havlicek and Larry Bird. More often, those moments
disappear. People remember Magic and Doctor J, and they forget
about Michael Cooper, K.C. Jones, Walt Frazier, Satch Sanders. They
forget how the Warriors shut down Elvin Hayes in '75 or why Bill
Russell kept beating Chamberlain and West.
 A: It's always been daunting trying to find work in one place
when you're living in another place. But today cross-country or
even international job hunters have a lot more options because of
the Internet.
There are Web sites geared to professionals in almost every
industry, often with job listings and discussion groups. The
discussion groups are a great way to network with colleagues and
nose around for job openings in other cities.
