The shift in homeless services to private hands could be the
turning point in negotiations over whether to keep the
five-year-old Department of Homeless Services. The agency, which
comes up for renewal every three years, is scheduled to dissolve
June 30 if an agreement cannot be reached.
Both Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter
Vallone support measures to make the agency permanent, but they
disagree on several issues, including the cutbacks at the agency
and conditions at the Emergency Assistance Unit, the office in the
Bronx where homeless families are screened and referred to
shelters.
Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the
Council's general welfare committee, which oversees the agency,
says he is concerned that reducing the agency's staff will rob the
homeless of essential services. Among the employees to be
eliminated are case management workers who counsel and nurse
families in the hotels. The other positions include workers who
serve food and do the dishes and laundry. The city plans to offer
those jobs to private agencies, officials said.
Gordon Campbell, the commissioner of the Department of Homeless
Services, said that in about three weeks, the city will no longer
use the hotels to house families beyond the 10 days that it takes
officials to determine whether a family has absolutely no place to
go besides a shelter. That change will diminish the need for the
case management workers at the hotels, he said. In 1993, the city
had contracts with 22 such hotels, and now it has 10, he said.
Under city law, New York is allowed to put homeless families in
commercial hotels for up to 60 days while they seek permanent
housing. For stays beyond 60 days, the law requires that the hotels
be no larger than 100 units and have kitchens in each unit. Since
December 1996, the city has not used hotels that do not comply,
Campbell said.
Friday, DiBrienza was working on a compromise that he planned to
submit to his committee for a vote Monday and to the full Council
on Wednesday. If the Council moves forward on a bill without a nod
from the administration, the measure could languish in
administrative limbo for months, resulting in the dissolution of
the agency.
The Department of Homeless Services has been given high marks by
homeless advocates for improving services for poor people and
finding permanent housing for the homeless. But even supporters
have criticized the agency's tough eligibility standards and its
use of hotels and the Emergency Assistance Unit to provide
emergency shelter for homeless families.
The Emergency Assistance Unit was never intended to provide
temporary shelter, but for years families have stayed there for
more than one night while waiting to be placed in other quarters,
becoming the focal point of a long-running court battle between the
city and homeless advocates. As a condition of making the agency
permanent, DiBrienza has insisted that the unit be equipped with
cots and cribs for families waiting to be placed.
But Campbell said that over the past eight months, the agency
has been able to place families in shelters within 20 hours and
therefore has no need for cots and cribs.
Steven Banks, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society's Homeless
Family Rights Project, called the Emergency Assistance Unit a de
facto barracks-style shelter for children and their families.
