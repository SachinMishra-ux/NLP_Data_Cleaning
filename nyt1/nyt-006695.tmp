The anti-tobacco bill blocked Wednesday in the Senate included
school vouchers for students who have been crime victims on school
grounds. The overall measure was popular with Democrats and was the
most likely vehicle for Republicans to sneak vouchers past Clinton,
but it is a dead issue now.
Meanwhile, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that voucher
programs can get around the constitutional separation of church and
state by giving public tuition funds directly to parents rather
than to the parochial schools. This dodge enabled the court to
interpret the program's primary purpose as helping parents make
wider choices rather than advancing religion.
The U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the issue. It is
unrealistic to believe that taxpayer subsidies would not promote a
new elitist state-supported private education system with religious
overtones. But the high bench, in its legal isolation, has not
always understood how scholarly decisions impact on real life.
Voucher proponents claim private schools do a better job of
teaching children than the public schools, and maybe they do.
But private schools have no public accountability. They can be
selective. They can reject for admission students with low grades
or troubled personalities.
They can expel unsatisfactory pupils. They can pay whatever
salaries they want to their teachers. They do not have to provide
special instruction to disabled students.
If a parochial school wants to promote a specific religion, the
state cannot say no.
They provide a great, stimulating social mixing bowl rich and
poor, clever and dense, together in class. It's the American way.
In some places, usually stable middle-class communities, this
ideal still works. Where it doesn't, where cops must patrol the
corridors, the public schools ought to be fixed. The way to do it
is by giving them more care and attention, not less.
