ATT is not in the local phone business in a major way, but its
wireless unit is leading the company's involvement with the home
networking consortium. ATT has explored the use of wireless
technology to offer routine local phone service. So far, those
efforts have borne little fruit in the market.
On the road in front of the barn, they had dumped two spiked
metal tracks from an old haying machine on the cobblestones to
block traffic. Another group of men, most in motley camouflage
uniforms, darted behind a barricade a few yards away. They peered
out from behind the pile of old planks, tires, bricks and sacks
filled with dirt.
Many have been lulled into believing that the curtain will never
close on this heady period of their revolt. Rebel leaders naively
insist that they can muster enough force with their light weaponry
and poorly trained volunteers to defend towns and positions against
a mechanized assault by Yugoslav troops.
On the hills and roads surrounding rebel-held areas, now as much
as 40 percent of the province, the government of Yugoslavia, of
which Serbia is one of two remaining republics, is positioning
hulking tanks. It also has sent armored personnel carriers and
spider webs of green camouflage netting that mask huge howitzers as
well as mortar and sniper positions.
The government troops are slowly strangling the rebel
strongholds, having seized the main road between Pec and Djakovica
from the insurgents over the past few days. The shattered houses
along the road, many with gaping holes, speak of fierce combat.
Serbia, for its part, at times seems as oblivious as the rebels
to the reality of its position, apparently ignoring the likely
long-range impact of the fury provoked by its counterinsurgency
sweeps, which have left over 300 people dead and caused 80,000
people to be displaced from their homes since March.
Since these assaults began, the ethnic Albanians who make up 90
percent of the province's 2 million people have largely abandoned a
tactic of peaceful resistance in their drive for independence.
War has a choreography that only its participants understand.
Fighters, locked in an embrace, feel out the daily beat and rhythm
until the set is shattered by a surge of violence. The old order is
then replaced with another, just as ephemeral as the last.
Such a dance is under way in Kosovo, where armed peasant farmers
and other residents, joined by hundreds of rebels who have picked
up weapons and uniforms over the border in northern Albania, are
facing down 50,000 government soldiers and special police.
In this village, about 40 miles southwest of Pristina, the
provincial capital, the men in the camouflage gear wear baseball
caps with red patches that show the black double-headed Albanian
eagle and the initials UCK, the Albanian acronym for the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
