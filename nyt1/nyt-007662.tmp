SAN FRANCISCO Maybe this is why Lee Janzen had downplayed the
potential depression when a sickening Sunday 79 had cost him The
Players Championship in March. Maybe this is why he had more
respect for his year than the statistics had shown.
On Sunday at The Olympic Club, the 33-year-old Janzen earned a
giant award for both hard work and good faith. Capitalizing on an
off day by his Orlando neighbor, Payne Stewart, Janzen shot a
2-under-par 68 to win his second U.S. Open by one shot at even-par
280.
Stewart, who was trying for a wire-to-wire win, stumbled to a
4-over 74 and finished at 281. His chance to tie Janzen and force a
playoff Monday came and went at the 18th hole, when downhill
20-footer try for birdie slipped a few inches below the hole.
Janzen trailed by seven shots after three holes Sunday, with
bogeys on No. 2 and No. 3, but played solidly down the stretch,
birdieing the 13th and then parring in. When Stewart's putt missed,
he broke into tears with wife Beverly.
A par at the difficult 17th was a key for Janzen after making
two bogeys and a double-bogey there in previous rounds. Janzen
fired his shot to the 18th over the flag, then cautiously eased a
bending 20-footer to within three feet, and made it for par.
Janzen, who won the 1993 U.S. Open at Baltusrol by two strokes
over Stewart started the sunny, cool day five strokes behind the
man in the plus-fours. . In the event of a Stewart collapse, Janzen
was not the most logical choice to step up and take over. It
clearly was Tom Lehman, who played in the final group for the
fourth straight year, but again walked away without the major he so
desires. Lehman stomached a 75 and tied for fifth, six shots behind
Janzen.
Georgia Tech U.S. Amateur champion Matt Kuchar concluded with a
74 and tied for 14th at 9-over 289, earning a return trip to next
year's Open at Pinehurst.
Former Marietta, Ga. player Bob Tway finished third with a 73 at
284, a stroke ahead of Nick Price, who had a 73 for 285.
Washington's growing involvement in a brutal Latin American
guerrilla war echoes the opening stages of American intervention in
the conflict in El Salvador in the 1980s.
