He is expected to come down hard on Martinez, who is safely
ensconced out of harm's way in eastern Nebraska, and on Muser and
Anaheim manager Terry Collins, who presumably kept the war at a
boil by sending the boys out to exchange fastballs to the soft
spots. Since neither of them play, Budig could throw the booklet at
them, look tough while impacting nothing.
This is a mistake, and a serious one. Would it not be better to
hype the rematch in mid-July until the good people of Orange County
are at full froth, and then bring out both teams in spangles,
flowing robes, and ring announcers cranked up on Sudafed and
creatine?
The proper course seems obvious. In these turbulent times,
dignity gets you nothing; if it still had value, there wouldn't be
the X Games, or hoop earrings on power forwards.
But no, Vice Admiral Budig will deal with the scofflaws himself,
with a justice as swift as it is sure. Men will be punished and
taught a lesson that will last with them for, uh, let's be
conservative and say 20 minutes.
OK, folks, here it comes the vehicle you've been waiting for
since Dodge introduced the new Ram in 1994 and Ford brought out the
new F-150 in 1996.
General Motors finally has caught up, and let me tell you, it
was worth the wait.
Chevrolet's all-new, full-size pickup begins rolling into
showrooms late this summer, the first remake of this vehicle since
the current generation, C/K, debuted for 1988.
For 1999, the truck takes the name Silverado, which in the past
was the designation for an uplevel trim package on the Chevy
pickups.
The GMC version, which will show up in the fall, has a new name,
too: the Sierra.
To answer the big question first: No, there are no radical
styling changes, such as those on the Ram and F-150.
