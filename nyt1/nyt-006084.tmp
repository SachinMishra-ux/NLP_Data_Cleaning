SEASIDE SEASIDE, Fla. This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years the first house was built in 1981 counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE SEASIDE, Fla. So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf
of Mexico would be the main attraction. No, indeed. Houses are what
draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT SUWANNEE, Fla. I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
DAYTON, Ohio A ritual of summer is to stretch out beside the
pool or on the beach, or curl up on the patio or porch with a good
book. For those who read with a mixing spoon in one hand and
those who just love to eat the book in their laps is often a
cookbook.
The lazy days of summer arrive officially next week, so we went
looking for cookbooks that are a good read. We wanted more than
just a collection of recipes. Some that we found are interwoven
with the memories of life. Others focus on learning the techniques
rather than the precise ingredients that make a great dish. One is
a biography.
Though the tidal wave of low-fat books continues, there are none
in this list. These books may be a light read, but they certainly
don't qualify as entertainment.
However, the fascination with Italian cookery continues. Two
books this season focus on life and food in the Sicilian-American
communities, one in the Little Italy of Manhattan and the other in
Brooklyn.
Here is a bunch to put in a bookbag when you go to the beach or
back yard:
E The Man Who Ate Everything, by Jeffrey Steingarten (Knopf,
$27.50). If irreverence is your bag, pick up this book by the food
critic of Vogue magazine. Don't expect recipes, though there are a
few tucked in peripherally, much the way some mystery writers do
these days.
Each free-standing chapter is perfect for a summer read on the
porch swing. The eclectic mix of recipes, from American apple pie
and butterscotch nut ice cream to chocolate granita and grilled
eel, may or may not tempt you to cook, but eaters will savor the
chase.
