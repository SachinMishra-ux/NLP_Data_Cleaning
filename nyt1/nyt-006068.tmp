If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
The littler they are, the cuter they are and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old or young the child is.
No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
