In another reminder of the perils of Internet news, Armey,
R-Texas, spread a premature report of Hope's death after The
Associated Press mistakenly put an advance copy of the 95-year-old
showman's obituary on its Web site.
One of Armey's aides gave the Internet story to Armey, who
handed it to Rep. Bob Stump of Arizona and asked Stump to announce
the death on the House floor.
The news caught everyone by surprise including Hope, who was
eating breakfast at his California home when his death was
announced. Ward Grant, Hope's longtime friend and spokesman, said
he immediately called Hope's home to check the veracity of the
report.
The mistake was no laughing matter in Washington, where Stump
and Armey were deluged with phone calls from reporters and Hope
fans.
The Associated Press quickly removed the offending item from its
Web site. News organizations routinely prepare obituaries on
prominent people who are ill or old, but the stories, obviously,
are not intended for public release until the subject is, in fact,
dead.
In corporate conference rooms, in dentists' chairs and over
dinner, the continuing news about both Viagra and Monica Lewinsky
appears to have accelerated a change in the way many Americans
speak about a subject that some would prefer be barely spoken about
at all.
In recent months, the subjects of sex and the language
describing sex acts and sex organs have been nudged a few inches
closer to the conversationally commonplace. Many Americans say they
have found themselves using words they would never previously have
used, discussing erectile dysfunction at dinner parties, talking to
their children about adultery, laughing (uncomfortably) at sex
jokes told in the presence of people like their bosses.
Dr. Mark Schwartz, the director of the Masters Johnson Clinic
in St. Louis, recently visited a new dentist for the first time and
says he became the audience for a battery of jokes about oral sex
told by the dentist, a man, in the presence of a female hygienist.
At a black-tie dinner at the New York Botanical Garden last
month attended by 1,100 people, Peter Bijur, the chairman and chief
executive of Texaco, strode to the podium and opened with a joke
suggesting that some of the floral centerpieces were having
Viagra-assisted erections.
One big reason for that has been the attention lavished by the
news media on issues like Gennifer Flowers' account of what she
said was a 12-year affair with President Clinton along with Paula
Corbin Jones' graphic allegation that the president had
propositioned her in a hotel room in Little Rock, Ark.
