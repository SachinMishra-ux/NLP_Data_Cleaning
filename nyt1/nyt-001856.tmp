Lindsay has endured a lot, to be sure the constant harping on
her weight and appearance, plus her parents' hurtful divorce. But
her travails are almost trivial by comparison to what Seles has
been through. If Seles can regain the level of excellence to which
she ascended in stomping Hingis, Davenport surely can raise her
personal standards several notches as well.
They're good friends, Monica and Lindsay. After Thursday, some
of the former is bound to rub off on the latter.
Lindsay was done in by that unabated flood of errant shots 56
unforced errors, according to the stat sheet and her maddening
inability to use her bigger serve to any kind of advantage. If
anything, she was better off trying to return, seeing as how her
service breaks of Sanchez Vicario outnumbered her own holds by a
7-2 margin.
Amazingly, she lost eight of 10 service games, facing a break
point in nine of them and trailing in every one. She would lose 64
percent of the points she served. Even at Roland Garros, where the
terre battue is the greatest of equalizers, that's ridiculous.
Sanchez Vicario held, winning a game point on which Davenport
seemingly swatted at least three clear-cut winners, only to have
Arantxa, her short legs churning, chase each of them down.
So the Spaniard advances to her sixth Roland Garros final, and
Lindsay goes home. Perhaps Wimbledon can be different. Grass is, in
theory, a more suitable surface for her, and for a change, she
needn't be in a hurry to forget Paris.
Not even Steffi Graf. Now, Hingis might, but she has a ways to
go, and she got no closer Thursday, suffering a 6-3, 6-2 throwback
thumping in the French Open semifinals from the born-again Seles.
They first met in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1989, Seles and
Hingis. The bubbly, disarming teen from Yugoslavia took a picture
with the child who shared her tennis dreams. Their paths didn't
cross again until Hingis, a sassy 16 with the No. 1 ranking in her
cross hairs, humiliated Seles on a tennis court.
Seles missed more than two years after Gunther Parche, a
deranged German, plunged a knife into her back during the
changeover of a match in Hamburg in April 1993. And when she did
return physically, her killer game didn't automatically follow.
When it appeared it might, when her body and psyche were almost
well, she would be confronted by the cancer in her father's
stomach. Karolj Seles died May 14, less than two weeks before the
French Open. Seles wasn't sure if she should come to Paris. She
didn't hit a ball for 12 days.
