Most analysts agree that the warm reception Yassin has received
represents a fresh challenge to Arafat's rule. And the timing
couldn't be worse for the Palestinian leader's sagging popularity.
Months of stalled peace negotiations and a stagnant economy have
helped tug Arafat's approval rating down to less than 50 percent.
Adding to these difficulties, Yassin, a 61-year-old paraplegic
who is nearly blind and suffers from lung ailments, has been
touring hard-line Arab states such as Syria and Iran and moderate
states such as Saudi Arabia with a message likely to rankle Arafat
even more: No peace with Israel.
The danger to Arafat has not been lost on the government he
heads, the Palestinian Authority. Officials in Gaza try to downplay
the threat Yassin's whirlwind tour poses to Arafat's rule by
spinning the high-profile visits as a warning to Netnayahu.
But in a move that reflected Arafat's concern, the Palestinian
government asked Jordan, home to about 3 million Palestinians, not
to grant Yassin entry. So far, Jordan, Lebanon and South Africa
have refused to allow the sheikh an entry visa, according to a
Hamas leader in Gaza.
Yassin's trip began with a low-key request by the sheikh to
visit Egypt for medical treatment. In April, Israel gave him
permission to leave Gaza on a diplomatic passport issued by the
Palestinian Authority, and Hamas leaders expect Israel to allow him
to return to Gaza without incident. Israeli security services have
been debating whether or not to let him return.
From Egypt, Yassin went to Saudi Arabia to attend the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca, which every Muslim is obligated to make at
least once in his or her lifetime. But something unusual occurred.
When the Hamas leader arrived in Saudi Arabia, its leaders, King
Fahd, and Prince Abdallah, asked to see him. Within weeks, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Yemen also extended invitations.
In each country, Yassin was received by kings, princes and
presidents.
Next, the sheikh traveled to Kuwait, Syria and the Sudan, whose
Islamic president, Mazjoub Khalifa, suggested setting up a charity
to aid the Palestinians. Hamas officials say they were even trying
to set up a meeting between Yassin and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. From
there, the Hamas leader may go to Pakistan, the first Islamic
nation to detonate a nuclear device, and Malaysia, the most
populous Islamic country in the world.
Yassin's tour comes as relations between the Palestinian
Authority and Hamas remain at their lowest level since last fall,
when the Hamas leader was let out of an Israeli prison, part of a
swap with Jordan for captured Israeli intelligence agents who had
botched an attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in Amman.
Arafat, apparently concerned that Hamas would take revenge by
setting off another suicide bomb and blow away his chance to wrest
territory from Netanyahu, found evidence implicating another Hamas
militant in Sharif's death. Then Arafat silenced the Hamas leaders
who claimed otherwise by throwing them all into jail.
But the attention on Yassin has boosted Hamas' standing, both at
home and abroad. Usually supported by no more than 10 percent of
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the most recent poll
taken by a Jerusalem-based Palestinian think tank shows that about
one of every four Palestinians now sympathizes with Hamas.
