But Nash's wife continued to care for him even after they were
divorced. The bout of hospitalizations eventually ended. His mother
was dead, his sister unable to take him on. So in 1970, she offered
to let Nash live with her in Princeton, reasoning that a quiet life
on the edges of an academic community would be better for him than
any other regime.
Meanwhile, along a lengthy front, economics had begun moving
toward the austere mathematical structures that Nash and others had
erected in the late 1940s. The relevance of his early work to the
description of everyday dilemmas had become clear. Colleagues had
begun campaigning for Nash's election to the Econometric Society and, in Sweden, for a Nobel Prize.
At that point, reporter Nasar is at her best. She captures the
furious competitiveness that accompanies the award of major prizes
like the Fields Medal for mathematics, and penetrates the swirl of
rumor that had surrounded the award of the 1994 Nobel.
It turns out that conservatives in the Swedish Academy had
staged a last-minute attempt to prevent the award to Nash on the
very morning the announcement was to be made. Only narrowly did it
fail. In the end, Nash was well enough accept the prize and even
to resume working, in a limited way.
What is certain is that the worlds of business practice and
economic theory are coming closer together. And that the rules
governing human conduct are the same in each.
FPL officials said customers are pumping up air conditioning
units and putting a noticeable but manageable strain on their

Palm Beach County residents have been dealing daily with almost
record-high temperatures. With a 50-percent humidity level, the
heat index, which is how hot it feels when the humidity is
considered, stayed just on this side of 100 degrees.
The culprit is a high pressure system that parked itself over
Florida and has refused to move. The first hope for cooler
temperatures and a few raindrops will not come until the weekend.
The temperature hit the century mark for the third straight day
at Daytona Beach. The daily record high temperature at the National
Weather Service office in Melbourne was broken for the third day in
a row when it reached 99 degrees Thursday afternoon. The old record
of 94 degrees was set in 1980.
Wednesday, the state issued a health alert to advise residents
about possible health problems due to exteme temperatures around
the state.
