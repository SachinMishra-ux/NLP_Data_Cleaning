For instance, the group will make its recommendations in early
December just after the elections but in time to bring proposals
before the General Assembly in January. That timing enables the
group to approach a newly elected governor and lieutenant governor
somewhat outside the political fray. The group will convene July 1.
The carefully selected members are not allowed to send
representatives.
It's too early to know if the Atlanta chamber's initiative will
produce the elusive consensus and real solutions. But for the first
time, it will bring key players to the table on equal footing.
Most significantly, ARC, the Georgia Department of
Transportation and the Environmental Protection Division will be
there along with key business and political leaders in the region.
The potential is for the group to hand over to the next governor
a game plan he could call his own. Correll said it will be his
major initiative of the year. But as can be said of Atlanta
commutes, getting from here to there won't be easy.
ATLANTA -- Southern Co. is now the 49 percent minority owner of
South Western Electricity in Britain after selling a $170 million
stake to a Pennsylvania utility.
Atlanta-based Southern, which bought South Western, or Sweb,
three years ago, announced Thursday it had sold 26 percent of the
utility to a subsidiary of PPL Resources.
It was also first in a series of investments by U.S. utilities
in Britain's power sector. Since Southern's acquisition, U.S.
electric companies have spent $20 billion on 12 British regional
electric distributors. Many are reportedly reassessing their
positions following disappointing financial results.
First, the Conservative government blocked the company's 1996
attempt to take over National Power, a major British power supplier
then valued at $10 billion.
While the tobacco bill killed Wednesday was not as focused on
public-health measures as the one introduced last year, its demise
did spell the death of new funding for programs health officials
say are urgently needed, from treatment of smoking-related diseases
among the uninsured and poor to the prevention of youths from ever
starting to smoke.
The bill levied a new, $1.10-a-pack tax over five years, which,
combined with other penalties on tobacco companies, would have paid
for the new measures.
