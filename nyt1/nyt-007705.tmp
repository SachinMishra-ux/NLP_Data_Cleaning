NEW YORK A year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public
school teachers in New York City could hold remedial and other
supplementary classes inside religious schools, rather than in
oversize vans off the school grounds, school and union officials
say there have been no complaints from those teachers.
The only problem has involved classroom space: Because some
parochial schools did not have room for the additional classes, a
third have retained some of the vans, which are leased by the Board
of Education, and are expected to do so again next school year. The
price tag, estimated at $5.1 million in the school year ending this
month, is being paid by the federal government.
For most of the more than 150 religious schools in New York City
that receive the teachers' services, the constitutional lines
between church and state have blurred a bit this year, albeit
subtly. On Friday, for example, Bernadine DeCarlo, a social worker
employed by the Board of Education, weaved through the hallways of
St. Luke's School in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, past
crucifixes and statues of the Virgin Mary.
Under federal law, public schools must provide special services like tutoring in English as a second language or special
counseling to all students who qualify, whether in public,
parochial or other private schools. From 1965, when the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act was passed, until 1985, those services
were typically provided in parochial classrooms by public school
teachers, who took their assignments voluntarily.
But in 1985, the Supreme Court found that the coexistence and
monitoring of secular and religious activities within the religious
school buildings had led to an unconstitutional entanglement of
church and state. The court ruled that the teachers could not hold
classes inside religious schools. In response, the idea of teaching
in vans was conceived.
During the 12 years between the decisions, New York City spent
$100 million in federal education aid to lease the ubiquitous red,
white and blue vans, each 40 by 8 feet, that were parked outside
Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran and other religious schools, their
generators always humming.
At St. Luke's, a brown-brick building with 363 pupils in
prekindergarten through eighth grade, the principal, Sister Pat
Howell, was able to partition an upstairs classroom with file
cabinets to make room this year for the classes in English as a
second language and remedial reading.
Nonetheless, until more space is renovated, Lee Fettner
continues to teach as many as 10 remedial-math students at a time
in a van that is little bigger than a motor home and sits outside
the school's 139th Street exit.
Like most Japanese, Iizuka doesn't buy stocks or mutual funds.
Instead, she has socked away her savings of about $40,000 in two
bank accounts that pay less than 1 percent interest annually almost the equivalent of sticking the money under the mattress.
New foreign companies seem to join the fray daily, with the
latest link up being Travelers Group Inc.'s proposal to buy 25
percent of brokerage firm Nikko Securities Co. Banks are scheduled
to start selling funds by year-end, and Fidelity and others already
sell their funds from rented spaces inside individual Tokyo
branches of prominent banks.
