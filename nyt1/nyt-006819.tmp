UNITED NATIONS The chief U.N. arms inspector for Iraq said
Thursday that a plan for ending sanctions that he and the Iraqis
agreed to last weekend would collapse if the Iraqis withheld
documents or other evidence, something they threatened to do even
while the talks were in progress.
The chief inspector, Richard Butler, sent a report to the
Security Council Thursday that paints a much less optimistic
picture than he or Iraqi officials presented when the Baghdad
meetings ended on Sunday and it appeared that the Iraqis were
within striking distance of the lifting of an oil-sales embargo.
Thursday's report reveals that Iraq, while agreeing to some
cooperation, is in fact attempting to block all investigations into
other crucial areas, including chemical and biological weaponry,
and wants to defer discussions of other issues.
In his report to the Security Council, Butler said that the
Iraqis had agreed to deal with a list of certain outstanding issues
by early August, including providing detailed information on
missile warheads, mustard gas shells and other weaponry, along with
documents. But they flatly refused to address questions about
production of the deadly nerve agent VX.
The leader of the Iraqi delegation to the talks, Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz, also told Butler that no more information
would be provided on biological weapons, and demanded another
technical evaluation of biological issues by outsiders, notably
from Russia, France and China, who are the supporters of Iraq on
the Security Council. That evaluation is scheduled to begin in
Baghdad on July 11.
Aziz also refused to discuss the issue of tons of missing rocket
fuel or the government's concealment policies, which arms
inspectors say were formulated systematically to confuse and
mislead them. And the Iraqis once again raised a demand that
American U-2 aircraft stop flying over their territory.
Officials familiar with the talks in Baghdad on June 13 and 14
say that Iraq arrived with huge delegations and videotaped the
proceedings, which at times appeared more staged than real. The
government of President Saddam Hussein, which is distributing the
videotapes to diplomats in Baghdad, apparently believes that the
tapes will convince the world that the disarmament process has
reached its final chapter and that Butler's disarmament commission
has already been sidelined.
The next major sanctions review takes place in the Security
Council in October, more than eight years after an embargo was
imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Iraq wants all
sanctions lifted by the end of the year. Diplomats here say that,
at best, a ban on oil sales could end, but other trade restrictions
would remain in place.
The Iraqis, who are becoming more and more open about their
alliance with the Russians, French and Chinese in efforts to end
the oil-sales embargo, left U.N. officials and diplomats meeting in
Baghdad with the impression that Iraq thinks that it has enough
political support in the Security Council to defer discussion on
the tough areas they have closed to inspectors for now. Some
Council members have begun to talk about how 100 percent compliance
may not be possible in some cases.
Diplomats say that Iraq, which has been skillfully plotting its
way out of sanctions for a year, seems to be counting additionally
on President Clinton's unwillingness to face any major crisis with
Iraq or to take military action in the fall, just before a
congressional election.
