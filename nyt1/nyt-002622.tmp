GIBSONBURG, Ohio. Last Friday I asked my 8th-graders to close
their books (Saroyan's, The Human Comedy) and define the word
(ITAL)dignity(END ITAL). For a long few seconds, nothing happened.
Then Johnny went for a dictionary.
They're looking a bit bored, and I'm beginning to think maybe
I'm whistling in the wind - again. Saved by the bell.

Suddenly, they can be seen everywhere, these Compagnie
Rpublicaine de Scurit foot soldiers. And while their only visible
weapons are a glare, a long black billy club and what appear to be
steel-toed jackboots, they are not to be trifled with. I find
myself practically tiptoeing in their presence, because they have
been trained to assume guilt, not innocence.
The latter group notwithstanding, the French have bravely
promised unprecedented hospitality for the Coupe du Monde, the
Super Bowl for the rest of the world that starts Wednesday
afternoon at the new Stade du France, an I.M. Pei-designed marvel
in the gritty northern suburb of Saint-Denis. But they have also
flat-out guaranteed unprecedented levels of security.
With England's notorious soccer rowdies just a Chunnel ride
away, and the Islamic crazies from Algeria plotting more heinous
crimes against humanity as we speak despite being busted recently
in a major pre-emptive strike, nothing is being left to chance. One
hundred million francs have been spent by World Cup organizers,
with the government putting up a couple of billion more.
The technology in the Stade, where the championship game will be
July 12, is such that hidden cameras can focus on every one of the
80,000 faces in the stands and print out an instant mug shot. So if
you're lucky enough to have a ticket, remember not to be with
someone you're not supposed to be with, and by all means don't pick
your nose.
In Marseilles, where the English and the Tunisians tangle, Big
Brother will be watching especially closely. There, the lgion
trangre yes, the beau geste bunch, the French Foreign Legion has been charged with keeping the peace.
Already, they are not happy campers. Marching through Charles de
Gaulle Airport in full combat gear upon their arrival, the
Legionnaires roughed up several tourists, confiscating the cameras
of those who innocently tried to take pictures.
