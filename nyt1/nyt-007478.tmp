When Snyderman gives talks around the country, women ask about
the health changes they're experiencing and ones they're
anticipating, with some trepidation. As a resource for such women,
Snyderman wrote Dr. Nancy Snyderman's Guide to Good Health, a book
geared to women that covers such issues as heart disease, cancer,
menopause, aging and preventive health care.
Snyderman notes in the book that some health changes are
inevitable and some are exacerbated by a variety of bad habits,
such as too much caffeine, sun and alcohol as well as poor posture,
bad diets and lack of exercise.
And she tries to dispel common myths about women's health. One,
that because women live much longer than men, their health care
isn't as big a worry. Actually, Snyderman said, women don't live
much longer than men and many, at the end of life, must deal with
widowhood, dependency and degenerative conditions.
Two, that women's poor health is related mostly to their
reproductive organs. While it's true that women need health care
for maladies specific to their gender, it's also true that the
leading causes of death for men and women are the same heart
disease, cancer and stroke and in the same order, Snyderman said.
Snyderman finds that women, especially those past 40, are hungry
for information about preventing illness. Although her book goes
into more detail about prevention, Snyderman's brief advice is
this: Drink water, don't smoke, watch your diet and exercise.
Women also want to learn more about alternative health care,
Snyderman said. She encourages them to consider such options, but
only when it seems reasonable. For instance, she said, taking
echinacea for a cold or trying chiropractic or acupuncture for back
pain would make sense.
But she sees parallels between her TV work and regular
doctoring, and she appreciates the opportunity to reach so many
people.
- Americans grill 2.3 times a week, according to the
grillmeisters at Weber. (Compare that with just three times a year
for the folks in the United Kingdom.)
First it was Saveur magazine, and now the June issue of Food Wine magazine features a recipe for B.B's Lawnside Spicy Apple
Cider Barbecue Sauce. The article, written by cookbook author
Steven Raichlen, explores the four major styles of barbecue sauce:
Kansas City, Texas, North Carolina and Memphis.
Not just for breakfast anymore ... Susan Moehl and Penni
Johnson, the proprietors of Southmoreland, a Mobil Four-Star
bed-and-breakfast on Kansas City's Country Club Plaza, are dishing
up a barbecue breakfast for their guests from May to October. The
women use a hand-laid limestone barbecue pit to whip up such
breakfast barbecue meats as pork chops or ribs to ham or sausage
kebabs. They also sear Texas toast on the grill.
