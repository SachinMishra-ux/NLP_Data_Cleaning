NEW YORK Amid a surging demand to produce films in New York
City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration has promised a pair
of young entrepreneurs a lease to build a major Hollywood-style
movie studio in the Brooklyn Navy Yard provided they can obtain
$190 million in financing by December.
The plan, the most ambitious of several proposals for new sound
stages and film studios in the city, represents a gambit by two
little-known players in an industry defined by fast fame and
fortune. If they succeed in attracting the financing, they would be
granted a 70-year lease on 15 acres of the Navy Yard.
The site is among the city's most famous pieces of industrial
real estate, since it includes the cavernous shipbuilding structure
that produced the U.S.S. Missouri and other warships during World
War II.
No government incentives are being offered beyond those that
would be granted any industrial concern taking space in the city.
And entertainment industry executives said the plan could be
undermined by the relative inexperience of the partners, or by a
tendency of some producers to regard Brooklyn as a tawdry stepchild
to Manhattan.
Still, the Navy Yard proposal resonates with an odd blend of New
York City history, entrepreneurial drive, the promise of an
industrial renaissance and an unlikely alignment of forces on Wall
Street and at City Hall.
On Wall Street, the project's chief financial adviser is J.P.
Morgan, where investment bankers who specialize in media and
entertainment have been approaching corporate finance and Hollywood
executives to cover the anticipated $190 million in development
costs.
Among the advantages of the Navy Yard, he said, is the sheer
availability of space, its ready access to major highways, its
isolation from residential areas and its proximity to the hotels
and other amenities of Manhattan. He said he expected financing for
the project to be in place by September. If so, construction could
begin by early next year, and the first production could start a
year later.
For many producers, the key advantage of having a full-service
studio in New York would be that it would eliminate the need to
travel back and forth between California sound stages and
production sites in the East.
The authors of the Navy Yard proposal, who would control what
they are calling simply New York Studios Inc., are Louis Madigan, a
jocular, 30-year-old computer consultant and Internet whiz, and
Cary Dean Hart, 35, a movie-set designer.
The two men said they approached J.P. Morgan and the Navy Yard's
directors with their idea a year ago, and in March were given the
conditional promise of a 70-year lease. If financing is obtained
and the studio built, their payments would be $16,250 a month, an
amount that would triple after five years of operation.
