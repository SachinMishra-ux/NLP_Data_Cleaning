The four Trump development projects make him the leading
developer of new courses within the region, which he believes has a
powerful appetite for new courses, especially those of championship
caliber. But while his Westchester proposals percolate through the
public approval process, others also are developing or improving
courses in the region.
In Carmel, in Putnam County, an 18-hole course at the privately
owned Centennial club opened May 22 and is available to the public.
The greens fee is $65 Tuesday through Thursday, including golf
cart, and $85 Friday through Sunday. Nine additional holes are
expected to be ready for play in mid-July.
In West Nyack, in Rockland County, the Manhattan Woods Golf Club
is expected to open in July, with play limited to members.
Several existing clubs are busy sprucing up to hold their
position in the midst of all the new competition. The Ridgeway Golf
Course, a private club in White Plains, for example, is embarking
on a $3.5 million renovation of its clubhouse, expanding its dining
room, installing a new kitchen and upgrading locker-room
facilities.
There are a total of 50 golf courses in Westchester County.
Seven are open to the public and the rest are private.
At one time, Trump planned to build a golf course in New Castle
on land owned by International Business Machines. But that idea was
dropped when the county acquired the land to build its sixth public
course. The county will soon send out a request for proposals to
find a developer for the project.
In Putnam Valley, where Trump bought the 265 acres off Indian
Hill Road, there have long been rumors that he wanted to build an
upscale mall. He acknowledges that he was approached by a local
developer about such a project, but said that he was not
interested.
He did say he was negotiating with the New York state Department
of Transportation to buy an additional 58 acres that would bring
his property to the border of the Taconic State Parkway. Purdy
Halstead, the department spokesman, confirmed that the state had
agreed to sell Trump the land, but added that access to the Taconic
would not be granted.
Trump entered the county's real estate market in 1995 when he
agreed to purchase Davids Island in New Rochelle. He planned to
turn the abandoned Army post into a luxury residential complex.
After that deal fell through, he bought the 213-acre Seven
Springs estate, which straddles the Towns of Bedford, New Castle
and North Castle. The estate was originally owned by Eugene Meyer,
an industrialist who owned The Washington Post. His daughter,
Katharine Graham, to whom he left the newspaper and estate, was
married there in 1940. The estate's most recent owner was
Rockefeller University.
