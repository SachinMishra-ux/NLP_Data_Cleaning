But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are still much too
expensive for everyday use. The car companies, which would probably
be the biggest users of an efficient fuel cell, say that they still
cost roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an internal
combustion engine does. Chrysler, for example, figures that each
car-sized fuel-cell stack it buys costs $170,000. And running
houses on fuel cells is substantially more expensive than relying
on power from conventional utility plants.
Plug Power will not say what its prototype cost, arguing that
the figure is about as relevant as the cost of producing the first
automobile of a model year; it is astronomical but allows the
production of thousands more units at lower cost. Plug Power
predicts that it can commercialize fuel cells for houses by 2000,
at a cost of $3,000 to $5,000 each. Detroit Edison, a part-owner of
Plug Power, plans to purchase 30,000 to 50,000 units.
A New Jersey company, H-Power, also hopes for mass sales. In
March it made what it describes as the first ever unsubsidized,
fully commercial sale of a fuel cell that will supply energy for a
trailer-mounted highway sign, the kind that are commonly used to
warn of construction projects along the roadway. The company will
supply 65 of them for $759,000.
NEW YORK Entering a market crowded with some of the biggest
companies in cyberspace, The New York Times Co. said Monday that it
would introduce an Internet service about entertainment,
restaurants and shopping in New York City and its suburbs. The
site, called New York Today, will be available, starting Tuesday,
at www.nytoday.com.
The service will compete with New York Sidewalk from Microsoft,
Digital Cities New York from America Online and Citysearch New York
from Citisearch, a privately held company. All the companies are
seeking a share of the rich market for local advertising, which
includes classified advertising, yellow pages listings, outdoor,
broadcast and print ads.
Daniel Donaghy, the general manager of New York Today, said that
he hoped that the breadth of the news and reviews about New York
events written for The New York Times would distinguish the site
from the competition. But Donaghy, said the company expected that
the most important advantage would be technology that allows each
user to customize the service to see both information and
advertising related to the user's own interests.
The site is designed to look like an appointment calendar, with
weather forecasts, arts events and other information listed by
date.
In one unusual feature, advertisers can have their sales and
other promotional events mixed in with the arts and entertainment
listings. Users can see a list of these sales and, if they choose,
have sales for categories of their choice displayed when they first
enter the site.
In addition to the calendar listings, New York Today has a
number of other close links between advertising and the site's
editorial content. For example, a user who searches the classified
advertising listings of The Times for, say, condominiums in
Greenwich Village will also see advertisements offering listings of
the same type of property from several real estate brokers.
That advertising will be marked as such and displayed in red
type, while editorial content will be in blue type.
