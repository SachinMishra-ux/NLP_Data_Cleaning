The American Council on Exercise points out, for example, that
Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers, home-run hitter Mark
McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit Lions running back
Barry Sanders would all be deemed overweight or obese by the body
mass index which fails to distinguish between muscle and fat.
Experts also say most of the guidelines are merely cutoff points
defining the line between someone being healthy and someone
starting to show signs of chronic illness.
Individuals, therefore, need to monitor their own health and
work with their doctors to determine their own personal norms in
terms of cholesterol, weight and other factors.
Carol Conley, 77, has exercised all her life. And although her
blood pressure has recently registered higher than normal, she is
still diligent in swimming at the YWCA three times a week and doing
at least 20 minutes of stretching each day.
For her, it's a regimen that works on a personal level, and it's
also right in line with what the experts advise.
Q: How much of the overall conspiracy was mapped out when you
started and how much has been flying by the seat of your pants?
A: It's a combination. I had a rough idea where we were going,
but to tell you the truth, I discover new things all the time to
add in. By choice, I didn't want to create a bible so that I could
find my way through the process. It's like Lewis and Clark. I know
the direction I'm going, but I don't quite know what I'm going to
encounter on the way.
A: It was considered and calculated. You want to make it a great
movie experience for anyone who doesn't watch television. I think
you can completely enjoy the movie without knowing anything.
Q: Die-hard fans sometimes get turned off when you get really
murky. Do you just like to mess with people's minds?
A: I do. I always think you'd be much more irritated if I made
it simplistic than if I made it complex. It's a risky run.
