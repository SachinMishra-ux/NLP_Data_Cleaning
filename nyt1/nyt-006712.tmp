Most prevention programs under the bill would target children
because 99 percent of smokers begin in their youth, according to
studies done by researchers at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center in Worcester, Mass.
The bill killed Wednesday did not have the public-health
benefits of the original bill drafted last June, which allocated
$500 million to anti-smoking campaigns, $1 billion to smoking
cessation programs and research, $368.5 billion to treat indigent
citizens with tobacco-related disease. That measure also called for
larger warnings on tops and fronts of packages and the disclosure
of all tobacco company research and advertising strategies.
But although senators last week had gutted monies specifically
dedicated to public health measures, lawmakers and health officials
still had hoped to reinstate them in conference committee
negotiations with representatives of the House, after it had passed
a tobacco bill of its own.
Three dozen states are suing tobacco companies to recover costs
of treating smoking related diseases, with many planning to use
proceeds from the suits for anti-smoking programs as well. Both
California and Massachusetts have already combined anti-smoking
advertising with educational programs to curb smoking.
According to a study by the Amereican Cancer Society, under the
public health provisions of the original bill introduced by Senator
John McCain of Arizona, five million smokers a year would have
received help to stop smoking, more than 20 million teenagers would
have been exposed to anti-smoking advertising, and 50 million
children in grades K-12 would have participated in school based
prevention programs.
Scully has never thrown a pitch, hit or caught a ball for the
Dodgers. Yet Scully is the Dodgers.
For so many who have come to know Scully's soothing voice, he is
more than simply a baseball announcer. He is part of the family.
When Scully, 70, gets behind the mike for the first pitch of the
1999 season, it will mark the beginning of his 50th season with the
Dodgers.
He has outlasted all the players, general managers, managers,
even the O'Malley family. But Scully is as humble as ever, a man
thankful for his life, his family and for the opportunity he was
given to become one of the best and most famous announcers in the
history of sports broadcasting.
QUESTION: You got an announcer's job with the Brooklyn Dodgers
in 1950, one year out of Fordham University. In your wildest
dreams, could you have ever imagined your career becoming what it
is?
