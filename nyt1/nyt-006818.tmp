Those provisions were critical because compensatory damages in
smoking lawsuit, which have rarely been paid, were small. But a
punitive damage award, which is meant to punish a company, or the
loss of a class-action case could produce significant financial
damage.
Still, as the price tag of the June proposal grew in the Senate,
cigarette producers saw the prospects of higher prices for their
products, lowered sales and the loss of lawsuit protections they
had sought.
Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that advises institutional investors on legal terms, said
she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate an $11.3 billion
settlement with the industry last August.
Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
