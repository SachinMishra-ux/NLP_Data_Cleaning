Problem was, the neighborhood kids even Lynn said at first
that it had to be an accident. After all, they were friends.
And by the time the grand jury made its decision, the 60-day
dead line to submit charges in juvenile court had passed.
This has stuck in Hutchins' craw. Lynn wasn't some gang member
or even a kid asking for trouble.
Gaye Cochran, a deputy county attorney, pressed for a charge of
aggravated assault and wanted the girl treated as an adult.
The girl knew where the gun was kept. She had shown it off
earlier in the day. She was apparently upset about not getting the
CD.
The girl and her family have since moved out of the trailer
park. Their telephone number is not listed.
She registered for classes at South Mountain High on the same
day Lynn returned, and though Lynn has never spoken to her since
the shooting, his friends and neigh borhood kids have.
The police never found the bullet, though neighborhood kids say
the girl's mother dug it out of the wall of the trailer.
Gwaltney kicked a 33-yard field goal with no time remaining to
lift Georgia to a 23-21 win over Florida at the Georgia Dome. His
48-yard punt with five minutes to play helped swing the field
position bad for Georgia most of the game into his team's
favor.
Buford High's Tim Wansley earned Most Valuable Player honors for
Georgia. The 5-foot-9, 175-pound Georgia signee played both
cornerback and wide receiver and finished as the game's leading
rusher with his only carry, a 69-yard touchdown run on a reverse.
Wansley also had the biggest catch of the game, an 18-yard
reception on third-and-6 at the Florida 45 that set up the
game-winning field goal.
