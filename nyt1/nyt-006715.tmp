The day that I come to the ballpark and sit there and I'm
totally distracted and daydreaming, the day that somehow or other I
say `Oh, so what,' then it would be time. But I haven't experienced
any of that, even close. I'm happiest when I'm actually doing it.
Q: This past year has been so eventful in Dodger history, from
the O'Malleys selling the team to the trade of Mike Piazza. Does it
surprise you or have you been around long enough to come to expect
that the game is going to change?
A: Well, you get to a point of perspective where you know
nothing is forever, including yourself, including your job,
including anything and everything you see in the material side of
the world. But still, for me it was bittersweet when Peter O'Malley
made the annoucement that he was selling the ballclub.
I love the family, he's a particularly close friend of mine, so
I was sad. But at the same time I was happy because if that's what
Peter and Terry wanted, then I was happy for them.
As far as personnel upheavals and changes, that goes with the
territory. Maybe some seem more shocking than others, but they all
come and they all go.
Q: Does the sale of the club have any effect on how long you'll
stay with the Dodgers?
A: As far as the little relationship we have day-to-day with
News Corp., with Fox, it's been wonderful. I don't have even the
slightest doubt that this is where I want to be.
Q: Baseball has gone from being America's pastime to a sport
that is struggling to compete in popularity with other sports. Is
it still a great game or is money and greed ruining it?
A: It's still a great game. In fact, in my own opinion, it's the
best game. However, there are cycles, just like the seasons. There
was a long period of time where baseball was No.1. Then there was a
time, probably in the '60s and '70s, where professional football
was No. 1. Then people got tired of all the violence.
The swing right now is to basketball. Basketball may or may not
have labor problems this summer. Eventually, the pendulum will
swing the other way. And baseball will come back.
