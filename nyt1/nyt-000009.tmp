He fought in flurries. He went to the boards. He drove the ball
into a crowd of hacking behemoths. He and his team won with heart
and guile and, like Ali until he had nothing left, because Jordan
had promised that was precisely what he would do.
As it turned out, the Bulls began their ascent over this bump
when Jordan won a jump ball from a 7-footer.
It was the middle of the fourth quarter and the Bulls were
sagging, with Jordan struggling, with their front line plagued by
fouls. They were trailing by 77-74. They were waiting for Jordan to
do something, anything, to bail them out.
Jordan drove into the lane against the long-armed Derrick McKey,
who reached in as Jordan neared the basket and stripped Jordan of
the ball. It rolled on the floor, toward Rik Smits. Jordan, falling
backward, reached around and, with Smits, got a hand on the ball.
Jordan somehow won the jump. Steve Kerr wound up with an open
3-point shot on the right wing. The score was tied. The message was
sent. Jordan was going to drag his team to Salt Lake City, to its
sixth championship series. Twenty-eight points on a night when his
jump shot wasn't falling, when every advance to the basket brought
a double-team. Eight assists on a night when, more than ever, he
had to have help. Nine rebounds on a night when the Bulls
essentially won the game with second shots. With hustle plays. With
the directive to stop the whining over every call or play that
didn't go their way.
The time had come for them to put aside the preoccupation with
their uncertain future and get in touch with the precious present.
Time to forget the insipid organizational feuds, their contractual
complaints and the overblown burden of being the Bulls. Time to
take any contribution they could get, including a 14-point
perimeter explosion by Toni Kukoc, the one-time obsession of Jerry
Krause, the general manager, whom Jackson, Jordan and Scottie
Pippen heartily despise.
A couple of weeks sooner than anyone thought was likely, the
time had come to stare down dynastic mortality, a predicament one
must inevitably confront without the spiritual aid of an agent.
Until Sunday night, with Jordan purifying their lineup the Bulls
had not even been extended to a seventh game of a playoff series
since 1992. That was when Pat Riley's New York Knicks put a
second-round choke hold on Pippen, but inevitably played Game 7 at
the old Chicago Stadium with an exceedingly motley crew that
featured a slow-footed point guard named Mark Jackson, whose push
shot often landed uglier than it took off.
The lack of a companion superpower to effect a balance of power
has created an annoying haughtiness about the Bulls, a wart that
seems to have become visible to the country during the Indiana
series. This particular Bulls championship quest has become as
emotional as a deposit into a savings account. And when the balance
sheet didn't add up, it was always the fault of the bank.
This is not to say that Jordan's Bulls haven't been pushed,
haven't flirted with the sudden-death dangers of a seventh game.
Someone in a national sports magazine commented last week that this
year's Utah Jazz might actually be determined enough to force a
truly competitive finals, forgetting that three of the Bulls' four
victories in last year's finals were undecided until the game's
final shot.
