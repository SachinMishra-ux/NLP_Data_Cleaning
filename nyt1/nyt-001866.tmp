With its high concentration of hospitals, the Southern
California market has in recent years drawn additional suppliers
beyond HemaCare and the Red Cross, making it far more competitive
than in the early 1990s.
A large San Diego blood bank, for example, recently began
peddling its products in the Greater Los Angeles region after the
loss of a major local contract to the Red Cross left it with an
oversupply.
Officials at the nonprofit Red Cross, meanwhile, say they have
no intention of ceding any more of the $100 million L.A. market to
competitors. From an estimated 90 percent-plus market share a
decade ago, the Red Cross controls about 75 percent today. HemaCare
supplies about 10 percent of the market.
And because the Red Cross need not make money -- and in fact is
supplemented by charitable donations -- some have said it cheats. A
year ago, the organization settled out of court a lawsuit HemaCare
filed in 1995 alleging that its blood pricing in Los Angeles and
Orange counties violated federal fair-trade laws. And Nicely said
his former division did lose money throughout the first half of the
1990s.
WASHINGTON The director of central intelligence caused a stir
on Thursday by refusing to share some information with a Senate
committee investigating the transfer of satellite technology to
China, prompting Justice Department officials to backtrack and
permit the release of certain information.
The dispute began with the testimony of George Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, who cited a criminal inquiry by
the Justice Department in declining to disclose a document to the
Senate panel on its very first day of hearings.
Tenet told senators that the department had advised him that the
release of such information could jeopardize its inquiry into
whether a private company illegally passed on sensitive technology
to China.
The refusal had threatened to put the Clinton administration and
Congress at odds over an inquiry with serious national security
overtones, one to which President Clinton had promised his
cooperation.
After much criticism by senators on the committee Thursday, the
department lifted its objections to Tenet's disclosure of the
disputed document. But its spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, said on
Thursday night that the department still reserved the right to
excise sensitive information from other documents that might tip
off the government's strategy.
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the intelligence
committee, plans to make an issue of the department's reluctance to
release information on Friday when Attorney General Janet Reno and
Louis Freeh, director of the FBI, testify before the committee, his
aides said.
