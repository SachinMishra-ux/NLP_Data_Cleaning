Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. (To publish this provocative 1,125-word article, it must be

BEIRUT In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians and a large number
of Israelis fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
This fantasy all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
