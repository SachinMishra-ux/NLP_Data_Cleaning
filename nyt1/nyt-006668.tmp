The ride was generally good, although the independent suspension
could be heard working on rough surfaces. Both the rack-and-pinion
steering and the power anti-lock disc brakes seemed suitable for
the North American market, meaning neither required much effort.
Major features (some optional): air conditioning, power locks
and windows, cruise control, power tilt/slide sunroof, power
rack-and-pinion steering, 100-watt AM/FM stereo with six speakers
and CD/cassette players
WASHINGTON Overcoming months of resistance from Republican
leaders, the House began Thursday to debate the main bipartisan
proposal for new campaign finance laws.
Up to seven more weeks of debate on hundreds of amendments lie
ahead before a final vote in the House under a new schedule for a
final vote promised by Republican leaders.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, made a statement on
the House floor that most members interpreted as a pledge there
would be a vote on the final, amended version of a campaign-finance
bill before the legislators start their summer vacation, now
scheduled to begin Aug. 7.
But Armey's promise persuaded Shays and other GOP supporters of
the bipartisan bill to drop their threat to vote against new rules
that allow a record number of amendments during the debate.
The modified rules adopted Thursday by a vote of 221-189 state
that let members offer an unlimited number of amendments that are
germane, or related to campaign finance bills, and a record-setting
258 non-germane amendments.
The Shays-Meehan bill would ban all contributions to parties for
any purposes from corporate or union treasuries, and would limit
the amount that any individual could contribute in one year. Under
the current system, parties can accept as much as they want from
any source to fund activities that the parties assert do not
provide direct assistance to federal candidates.
PARIS There are three good reasons for despising the thugs,
the mostly English thugs, who ran wild in Marseille the other day and who are lying in wait to do it again.
The first reason to despise them is that they despise us. They
are sociopaths, not stupid, and they mean to attack the helpless,
throw society into chaos. They just happen to choose soccer for
their cover.
