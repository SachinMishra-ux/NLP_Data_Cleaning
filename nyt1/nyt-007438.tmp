In Flushing, Queens, Agnes Ho and her husband, Steve, have
turned their red-brick house into a nerve center of Chinese opera.
A dining table is heaped with immigration documents for opera
singers, grant applications to federal and state arts agencies,
invitations to opera troupes in China. A basement walled in mirrors
serves as a practice room.
From here, Mrs. Ho, 61, runs the Tung Ching Chinese Center for
the Arts, a nonprofit group that has sponsored more than 50 opera
stars to come to live in the United States.
Behind the brick house, Mrs. Ho and one of her boarders, a newly
arrived opera performer named Xie Dong, opened a shed filled with
costumes and props. Silk and satin robes, densely layered with gold
and silver embroidery, sat on shelves carefully labeled with the
names of individual operas. A steamer trunk overflowed with swords
in elaborate scabbards. Mrs. Ho bought the collection, which she
thinks may be the largest of its kind, with money she earned here
as an insurance agent.
Last year, a 40-member opera troupe from the northern Chinese
city of Shenyang went to Berkeley, Calif., to perform. Three of the
leading performers, all award winners in China, fled the troupe and
sought help from Mrs. Ho. All three now live in Queens, around the
corner from the Hos' house.
Not far away, on two Saturdays each month, the annex of St.
George's Episcopal church in Flushing echoes with the wail of the
kundi, the bamboo flute that is at the center of kunqu (pronounced
KUN-CHEW) opera. Slumped in a leather armchair one recent Saturday,
Chen waited for his students at the Kunqu Society workshop.
On that day, 20 members of Shanghai's most prominent opera
troupe were in Los Angeles to perform; as pictures of the massacre
filled television screens at the troupe's hotel, eight of them
sought asylum. Nearly all of them are now in New York.
The workshop in Flushing offers six hours of courses embracing
the elements of kunqu opera first flute, then singing, followed
by movement and acting and concluding with percussion and all
classes are led by kunqu masters who learned their art in China.
All four principal genres of Chinese opera can be seen in New
York: Cantonese yue, popular in Hong Kong and Guangdong province;
Beijing, now known as the national opera form; Shanghai yue, heard
predominantly in central China, and kunqu, the most prized among
many cognoscenti.
At the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th
century, kunqu was gradually displaced by the less sophisticated
Beijing opera, which embraced showy acrobatic and martial scenes
that proved more popular to less literate audiences. Today, Beijing
opera receives the most government support in China.
Earlier this month, Ms. Shi returned from an opera tour in
Austria. While she was gone, Cai and Chen performed at a gala opera
with two visiting stars from Shanghai before several hundred kunqu
aficionados at the Taipei Theater, on the Avenue of the Americas at
49th Street in Manhattan.
