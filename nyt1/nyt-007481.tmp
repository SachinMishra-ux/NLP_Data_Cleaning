Mayor Davis and a few others hopped in a car and drove toward
the billowing column of smoke.
Hooten thought the same thing as he jammed his pickup into gear
and headed up his dusty driveway.
Exhausted fire crews redoubled their efforts. The wind shifted a
little bit. The scorching sun, which has dried the state
relentlessly through three nearly rainless months, dipped into the
haze of smoke surrounding Waldo and raced to the horizon. As it
dropped, temperatures inched down from the 100-degree mark. As the
land cooled ever so slightly, a bit of moisture crept back into the
air.
It's been an odd weather year for Waldo. All winter, the town
was inundated by unusually heavy rains. Flooding hit a few homes,
tore up some roads, and caused major problems at the wastewater
treatment plant. Waldo was part of a federal disaster relief
declaration for the flooding.
For hours on end, Monahan and others kept answering the
telephones. The calls came from people they know by name and face
residents kept out because the fire danger was still too high.
Some left behind pets and were worried the animals hadn't been
fed. Estes, a high school economics teacher, volunteered to go to
the houses in question to feed and water the pets.
Vincent figures he slept about five or six hours total on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Tuesday he got home for a few hours
before returning at dawn Wednesday. Wednesday night he slept in
Police Chief D.W. Smith's office.
On the fireline, Tammy Nichols and her team members didn't sleep
at all. They came on duty Wednesday morning and went straight
through until Thursday morning when they finally got a break.
Nichols drives a bulldozer, cutting fire lines to try to stop
the flames from advancing. She wears a fire-retardant jumpsuit over
her pants and T-shirt, along with a hard-hat, a face shield and
heavy leather gloves.
Wednesday the flames jumped the fire breaks they were trying to
cut through the parched undergrowth. Bulldozers bogged down, even
threw a heavy metal track. Mechanics had to brave the flames to
repair the machines.
