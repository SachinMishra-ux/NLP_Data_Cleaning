President Khatami wants to promote civil society and the rule of
law. He wants to end Iran's isolation. He wants to improve the life
of the Iranian people. He is reaching out to Iran's neighbors and
he is reaching out to the United States.
By himself, Khatami won't be able to reverse two decades of
strident anti-Americanism. He is engaged in a fierce power struggle
inside Iran, which remains bitterly divided between hard-line
conservatives and reformers.
I believe we need to begin a policy of engagement with Iran. It
will not be easy and it will take time to produce results, but I am
persuaded that such a policy serves the American national interest.
The United States should use several avenues for outreach to
Iran and its people. Just as President Khatami chose CNN to send
his message to the United States, President Clinton or a senior
U.S. official can talk directly to the Iranian people through
interviews on Iranian radio and TV, or on the Persian service of
Voice of America.
The United States is concerned about Iran's attitude toward the
Middle East peace process. But we should not simply say Iran is
totally opposed to the peace process. We are deeply concerned about
Iran's support for international terrorism. Yet as Khatami knows,
Iran too has paid a price for terrorism. It has paid in isolation
from Europe, deep suspicion from its neighbors and sanctions from
the United States.
 Is Iran imposing constraints on the military activities of
groups it has supported? Hezbollah in Lebanon has talked about
pulling back from the border with Israel if Israel withdraws from
Lebanon. We should test the Iranians' willingness to change words
into deeds.
 Have military shipments through the Damascus Airport
diminished? It may be too early to get definitive answers, but we
should be communicating to Iran specific, doable achievable steps
that we want it to accomplish, on the way toward cutting off all
support for political violence.
 Is the declaratory policy of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, which condemned terrorism by all member states, holding
and being honored by Iran, the OIC's chairman for the next three
years?
The United States should send a USIA officer to the Swiss
Embassy, to initiate and coordinate exchange programs with Iran.
Former policymakers, professors, journalists, scientists, artists,
writers and representatives of non-profit organizations should meet
to discuss subjects of mutual interest. These will help break down
prejudices and misconceptions.
In addition, the United States should change its visa policies
for Iranians. We should end the current rules that collectively
punish Iranians through long delays for entire categories of visa
applicants. When a U.S. wrestling team traveled to Tehran in
February, they were treated respectfully by the Iranian government.
The United States reciprocated by treating Iranian wrestlers like
common criminals, delaying them for two hours at the airport so
they could be fingerprinted and photographed.
