The coalition leaders have said they intend to send out 45
million voter guides next fall and the school prayer vote is likely
to be one of its leading political indicators.
Several complained that the rules governing the debate of the
amendment were patched together at the last minute and didn't
reflect the importance of the issue.
Each side boasted its own lists of interdenominational backing.
But as symbolic as the debate promised to be, it was largely made
in a near-empty chamber.
The galleries were half-full with tourists, scout groups and
others, while below, on the blue, red and gold carpeted floor, only
a few members were present at any one time, except during a vote,
when the hall was full.
The vote was almost strictly on party lines. One who did break
ranks, Rep. Amo Houghton Jr., a New York Republican, captured the
flavor of the debate.
WASHINGTON Prodded by the Supreme Court, a three-judge appeals
court panel agreed Friday to consider whether President Clinton's
closest confidant and three Secret Service employees must testify
before a federal grand jury investigating an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up.
The judges two of them appointed by Clinton announced that
arguments would be heard in the final week of June.
By refusing to shortcut the normal appeals route, the Supreme
Court handed Starr his first court setback since he began
investigating the president's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
Starr's second loss came Friday when Chief U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson released a May 22 order refusing the
prosecutor's request for access to records of a Barnes Noble
bookstore that might show books purchased by Lewinsky. The judge
ruled that Lewinsky's purchases were irrelevant to Starr's
investigation.
Once the three-judge panel rules, each decision can be appealed
to the entire 11-member Court of Appeals, which includes seven
Republican appointees. From there, the cases could be appealed to
the Supreme Court.
