SAN FRANCISCO At 6 p.m. on a recent Thursday at San Francisco
International Airport, the video monitors blinked a disheartening
message for about 200 United Shuttle passengers waiting to fly to
Los Angeles.
The 5:50, 6 and 6:30 p.m. flights had just been canceled, and
the 6:15, 7 and 7:20 p.m. flights had been delayed. Only two of the
10 flights scheduled for the next three hours were expected to
depart on time.
Now, more than passengers are giving low marks to the airport,
the fifth-busiest in the nation and seventh-busiest in the world,
handling 40 million passengers and 428,000 flights a year. In its
annual rankings, the Federal Aviation Agency recently listed the
San Francisco airport as the second-worst for delays, behind Newark
International Airport.
Then, two weeks ago, The Sunday Times of London reported that an
international pilots' group had placed the San Francisco airport
among the 15 most dangerous landing strips in the world. The
newspaper said its account was based on a leaked copy of a report
by the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations at
its annual meeting in April.
A big part of the airport's poor ranking, he said, comes from
the fact that it conducts simultaneous operations on its two
parallel runways, which are only 750 feet apart. Under federal
regulations, runways must be at least 4,200 feet apart for landing
in foul weather.
Wilson said delays and difficult landing conditions resulted
from the old runways, which were designed in the 1920s for DC-10
aircraft, which have wingspans about half as wide as today's jumbo
jets. The length of the runways poses no problem, he said.
But if fog rolls in in the morning, the airport must cancel at
least half of its flights, delaying all arrivals and departures for
the rest of the day. Plans for expanding the distance between the
runways have been under way for more than a year. An airport
consultant began a study early this month designed to reduce
delays, ease the impact of noise on the community and make the
runways at least 4,300 feet apart.
The project would require the airport to fill in 400 acres of
the San Francisco Bay, with a cost that could exceed $1 billion.
The work, which could begin in 2002, would be financed by airport
bonds, to be backed by the city and San Francisco County.
Cumulus clouds will develop into isolated afternoon
thunderstorms Sunday in interior New England as low pressure which
has brought the recent unsettled weather lifts slowly offshore. Low
clouds and chilly onshore winds will prevail along the coast from
Maine to Cape Cod, though coastal areas should be spared the
showers that will plague the interior.
Sultry air will dominate in the Middle Atlantic States. High
pressure aloft will provide sunshine from central New York to
eastern South Carolina, though a few thunderstorms could develop
over the Appalachians.
