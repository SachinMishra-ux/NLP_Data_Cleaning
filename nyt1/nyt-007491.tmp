I don't mean to tell you that Windows 98 is anything as
important as the arrival of my Uncle Bill. After all, he usually
gave us silver dollars and told stories about Alaskan-grown
strawberries that got danged near as big as heads of lettuce. Uncle
Bill was a storyteller and free with his money.
But some of you will need to get ready for its arrival. You
probably won't need new blue jeans, but you do need to prepare.
As the arrival of Windows 98 draws near, let's talk about how
you can get your computer ready for the newest version of Windows.
I hope you've already taken care of the first item on my list,
adding RAM. All the versions of Windows, including 95, are about as
hungry as a puppy with a tapeworm. Forget all the minimum
requirements and make sure you have at least 32 megabytes. Get 64
if you possibly can. With either version of Windows, RAM works a
lot like a supercharger when it comes to speed. You will notice a
difference.
Next you need to take a hard look at your hard disk. Truth is,
even 1-gigabyte disks are becoming too small for folks with a full
complement of programs. The good news is that hard disks just as
is true with RAM chips are cheaper than ever. The bad news is
that all these cheap prices can sure add up if you need RAM and a
bigger hard disk.
You'll also want to consider a faster modem if you have anything
less than a 56k bps modem. Now what, you ask, does upgrading a
modem have to do with installing Windows?
Besides the fact this is an Internet world nowadays, Windows
uses the Web for a remarkable feature that automatically looks for
updates to Windows itself and then helps you install them. That
means that, if you use the built-in feature, it's less likely
you'll miss an important bug fix or software update. But some of
these updates are huge 6 or more megabytes. You'll want to make
the download fast enough to make the process relatively pain-free.
Next, make a quick inventory of multimedia accessories such as
video card, sound card and the like. Windows makes good use of
graphics and sound, but if your computer is more than three years
old, you'll likely want updates here.
One thing I wouldn't worry about is rushing out to buy a new
computer to take advantage of the USB (universal serial bus)
technology. Don't get me wrong. It's neat stuff with USB you'll
be able to connect a lot of gadgets to your serial bus without
worrying about conflicts. But you'll be buying a new computer soon
enough, so don't use USB as an excuse. If your PC is at least a
Pentium running at 166 megahertz, it should do just fine with
Windows 98.
Finally, check your wallet. If you are like most people, you'll
soon need to find about $109 because no matter what you think now you'll almost certainly upgrade to Windows 98 within the next
three or four months.
