That announcement came at E3, along with another from the
company on its new assessment technology feature being incorporated
into its JumpStart Learning System programs. Before using the
software, kids will take an assessment test so the program can
determine where the child needs the most help. Then the program
will begin at the most appropriate level for that child.
The new test will be included in soon-to-be released revamped
titles, JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade. It will also
be in a new title, JumpStart Adventures 6th Grade. The produces are
expected to be available in late summer or early fall. The price
will be in the $30 range.

For that, you'll need software tools with a higher level of
sophistication. If you're serious about working with images and are
willing to spend some time learning the intricacies of these
programs, you can achieve some spectacular results.
Here's a look at two software programs at two ends of the price
spectrum, and a low-cost drawing tablet you can use with either
one:
 Paint Shop Pro 5.0, $99, Jasc Software: If you've used
consumer software to work with images such as Adobe PhotoDeluxe
or Microsoft's PictureIt! and have been disappointed with the
lack of flexibility or power, Paint Shop Pro is worth considering.
And doing so is a snap. A fully functional version is available
for downloading from Jasc's Web site at www.jasc.com. Grab it, try
it, and if you decide to use it you can get a registration key, or
order the disk and accompanying manual online.
Paint Shop Pro has long been considered an alternative to the
pricier Photoshop, but it's always been a step behind in
capabilities. Version 4.0, for example, lacked the ability to do
layers, a feature that lets you lay one image on top of another.
You can change one layer without affecting the rest of the image, a
powerful tool when combining pictures or going after special
effects.
On the other hand, Paint Shop Pro has been easier to use than
Photoshop, and its developers tried to automate tasks wherever they
could. For example, version 4.0 of Paint Shop Pro could
automatically create a shadow effect, something that had to be done
manually in Photoshop.
This new version, though, brings Paint Shop Pro to near-parity
with Photoshop. It now includes the ability to do layers, albeit
with a simpler system than Photoshop.
