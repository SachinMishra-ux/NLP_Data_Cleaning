The committee applies 51 standing House rules that are found in
a 4-inch-thick black book with gold letters, which includes a
manual by Thomas Jefferson with his anecdotes and thoughts on how
the House should be run.
The rules book gets fatter every two years when members of every
new Congress update it, usually with footnotes. One rule,
stipulating that all amendments to a bill must be germane, is just
25 words long, but 26 pages of footnotes have been added to explain
how the rule is applied.
When he leaves Congress at the end of the year, Solomon, 67,
will have finished just four years in his six year-term as rules
chairman, after serving 16 years in the minority.
That's why his late April retirement announcement left many of
his friends and colleagues baffled. Dreier, 45, says he was one who
wasn't surprised. He said that when he was pondering leaving the
House to run for the Senate two years ago, Solomon discouraged him,
saying the chairmanship of rules would open up soon.
Solomon said he realized that after taking just five vacation
days in 20 years, he owed it to his wife, Freda, to spend more time
with her, his children and grandchildren. He also said he wanted to
make more money. He's paid $136,700.
Solomon insists his exit was not prompted by the fact that he
has only two years remaining in his chairmanship under a 1994
Republican caucus rule limiting committee chairmen to six years.
Solomon said he is confident that he could have become chairman
of another panel if he had finished his term as chairman of the
rules panel. For example, he might have taken over the helm of the
Veterans' Affairs Committee, Solomon says.
The spread of sex-change chemicals in the environment could soon
be tracked with a test that uses tadpoles and liver cells of frogs.
The test, developed in Germany, takes only two days to work.
The sex-changing chemicals, which mimic female hormones such as
estrogen, are present in many pesticides and plastics. They are
causing increasing concern because they have been implicated in
breast cancer and declining sperm counts, and may also interfere
with fetal development.
The new test, developed by Werner Kloas and his colleagues at
Karlsruhe University, involves exposing cultures of liver cells
from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis to the chemical in
question.
