Sloan tried everything. He inserted Greg Ostertag into the
starting lineup for Greg Foster. He implored his reserves to shake
things up and be active when they went into the game.
After struggling mightily from the field in the first two games,
Malone got out of the gate quick. He made his first six shots 12
of Utah's 14 first-quarter points and helped the Jazz ease the
transition into a hostile arena.
But his teammates offered no help early. Only two other Jazz
players had field goals through the first 15 minutes. If it wasn't
careless turnovers, the best-executing team in the game was given
the guillotine by Chicago's menacing defense.
The travel time and lack of rest from playing 48 hours earlier
was supposed to account for sloppy play on both ends, but the Bulls
looked more precise and poised than they had since the finals
began.
It was as if they had used the first two games to collect
themselves, to remember what it was like to be in control of a
series and not give ground to a challenger. Maybe it was Pippen
still trying to fool with Malone's mind.
Pippen has boasted before about his team's prowess. But never
before has he made such a brash prediction as the one he made as he
was leaving the Delta Center in Salt Lake City on Friday night.
Jean Tower Rennie, the founder of the Collateral Dames, one of
the first women's investment clubs in the United States, died on
May 31 at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84. The cause was
heart failure, her family said.
Mrs. Rennie was born in Milwaukee on Feb. 3, 1914, the daughter
of Edwin Tower and Bessie Applegate Tower. Her mother's family was
instrumental in the founding of Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
Mrs. Rennie attended the Downer Seminary in Milwaukee
and Collegiate School in Louisville and graduated from Vassar
College in 1935. Although she had no formal training in finance,
Mrs. Rennie's lifelong interest in the stock market led to the
organization of the Collateral Dames in 1957. In the 15 years of
its existence, the club attracted chief executive officers and
economists to Milwaukee as speakers. Club members also spent a week
in New York, at the invitation of the New York Stock Exchange and
several leading companies.
Mrs. Rennie and her husband, William Roxburgh Rennie, a
manufacturers representative, were married in 1940. They were
active supporters of the English Speaking Union, an organization
that promotes relations between the United States and Britain, and
after her husband's death in 1985, Mrs. Rennie succeeded him on the
board of the organization.
