Though they were to fly from London to Manchester in a smaller
jet, British Airways told Woodward and her father that they could
not guarantee security from reporters on the plane. As a result,
Miller drove the Woodwards 200 miles north to Manchester Airport
for the press conference.
Reached by phone in Chicago, Deborah Eappen's brother, Paul
Spellman, critized Woodward for failing to acknowlege his sister
and brother-in-law during the press conference, and said the family
is offended that she still won't acknowlege her responsibility.
Back in Elton, Woodward was escorted by local police to her
front door. She bounded out of a chauffered minibus and hugged her
sister Vicky. Cassie, the family's German shepherd, joined in the
celebration.
The Woodward family then posed for photographers on their front
stoop under rainy and gray skies, then disappeared into the house.
Later, Woodward withdrew to the bedroom she kept as a teenager,
filled with stuffed animals and lined with posters of British rock
groups Pulp and Pet Shop Boys.
Woodward's arrival home was greeted with near and deliberate
silence from residents. Few villagers were on the street as
Woodward's calvacade drove by.
Many said they are still embarrassed by images of supporters
quaffing champagne and singing soccer victory songs after
Woodward's conviction was reduced to manslaughter six months ago.
Others said they have become disillusioned after allegations that
the Woodwards misused money in their defense fund, and reports that
one of Woodward's lawyers, under arrest for drunken driving,
blurted out that she had come to believe her client was guilty.
Stop, as they once exclaimed in Certs commercials: You're both
right. Sales pitches for a wide variety of products are indeed
being infused with increasingly explicit images and language, which
until recently had been considered too daring for conventional
advertising.
The trend to be rude, crude and sometimes lewd is bringing the
American advertising sensibility somewhat closer to the attitudes
that have long prevailed in Europe, where consumers are routinely
exposed to naked bodies, swearing and obvious sexual situations in
brand campaigns.
Though Americans are still unlikely to see a bare-breasted woman
utter a four-letter word in a commercial, provocative ploys that
were once confined to ads for niche products in fringe media baggy jeans advertised in snowboarding magazines aimed at young
men, for instance are making their way into the mainstream.
The penchant to test the boundaries of taste is just another
example of how advertisers try to stay contemporary, updating how
they speak and behave to reflect how consumers actually speak and
behave.
