If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
