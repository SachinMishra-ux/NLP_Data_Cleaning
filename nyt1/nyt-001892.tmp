He did not have his good fastball. But when he started to retire
Cardinals hitters without it, his confidence soared.
LOS ANGELES -- When John Elway walked the halls of Granada Hills
High School in the late 1970s, he was a big man on campus --
leading the baseball team to back-to-back city championships and
the football team to the city playoffs.
The 37-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback and Super Bowl
champion returned to suburban Granada Hills to join 3,500 fans for
the renaming of the football field as John Elway Stadium. It had
been named after founding Principal Bryce Schurr.
For Elway, who traveled from his home in Engelwood, Colo., with
his 8-year-old son, Jack, this marked a rare appearance at his alma
mater.
Just this week, Elway announced that he would play one more
season in the National Football League before calling it quits. On
Thursday, his return to the stadium where it all began elicited
memories of his high school victories -- one in particular.
The renaming of the stadium was engineered by Elway's high
school teammate Chris Sutton, coach Darryl Stroh and Principal
Kathleen Rattay. And it did not come easily.
Albert Irwin, the school's principal from 1976-86, who signed
Elway's diploma, acknowledged there was a lot of controversy over
the name change.
Former teammates and current coaches also say Elway deserves the
honor. His name on the new $8,000 scoreboard, donated by an
anonymous former high school teammate of Elway's, will help
motivate future Highlander players, they say.
In talking to the students, Elway espoused those ideals, telling
them to set goals just above their reach and get an education so
they will be prepared for future opportunities.
That and more have earned him cult status among his fans, but
that was nowhere more apparent than in Denver, where two TV
stations carried the 50-minute ceremony live.
