Soccer came to Iran decades ago via the two countries considered
most imperialist here, Britain and the United States. British oil
workers played the game in Abadan, and American and British
missionaries taught the game at their schools.
After the young Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi played center forward
at his Swiss boarding school in the 1930s, soccer was elevated from
a street sport to one worthy of the higher classes to play at their
private clubs.
Some leaders of the revolution tried to squelch the sport,
putting players in long pants and arguing about whether the game
was anti-Islamic. But that was difficult to do, because so many
clerics liked the game. Even Khomeini's son, Ahmed, played on a
team in the holy city of Qum.
LYONS, France The Iranian players shook hands with the
Americans before Sunday night's game, handed them white flowers
symbolizing peace and even posed together for a team picture. But
friendship extended only so far. There was a soccer game to win,
and not only did Iran prevail, 2-1, but this historic victory
knocked the United States out of contention in the World Cup.
This was the first time that Iran and the United States had met
in soccer and the first time that Iran ever won a game in two trips
to the World Cup. The countries exchanged visits by their
Olympic-style wrestling teams this year, and have participated in
the Summer Games, but this was the most visible head-to-head
sporting event between the two countries since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
In victory on Sunday night, Iranian players said it was
significant to have defeated the Americans, and not necessarily for
political reasons.
Although soccer's world governing body had feared that
protesters would try to disrupt the game, just the opposite
happened, as fans of both teams seemed to go out of their way to
show that they could be courteous and friendly even if their
governments could not. The only demonstration was a vigorous but
peaceful protest against Iran's Islamic regime, launched by several
thousand Iranian expatriates who smuggled T-shirts and banners into
Gerland Stadium showing the pictures of two leaders of a
Paris-based opposition group called the National Council of
Resistance.
In Tehran, thousands of celebrating fans took to the streets,
some women without their scarves, despite efforts by the Islamic
regime took steps to make sure that the celebration was not as
vociferous as it had been last November when millions took to the
street in spontaneous celebration after Iran qualified for the
World Cup for the first time in 20 years.
Still, the Iranian players said they knew the ordinary people of
Iran would be exultant.
The match was played several days after President Clinton called
for improved relations with Iran after 19 years of enmity between
the two countries, and followed a call in January by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami for cultural exchanges between the two
countries.
