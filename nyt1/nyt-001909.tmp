What happened after that 6-5 loss to Fresno State on March 18,
the midpoint of the season, is why the Sun Devils will play for the
national title Saturday.
ASU went 18-9 in the second half primarily because its offense
kicked in gear. The Sun Devils scored 199 runs in the first half,
262 in the second. They had 281 hits in the first, 330 in the
second.
Shortstop Michael Collins' batting average leaped from .206 at
the midway point to .287 at the end of the regular season. Catcher
Jeremy Jones improved from .250 to .342; Moreno from .317 to .343;
and Casey Myers from .328 to .389.
In the series opener against California, Lowery allowed just two
hits and struck out 12 in seven innings as ASU won, 6-1.
Two days later, the Sun Devils rallied with six runs in the
ninth to beat the Bears, 7-6.
No recent cosmic discovery has generated as much excitement in
the scientific community as Thursday's confirmation that neutrinos
do indeed have mass and that they oscillate from one state to
another as they stream by the trillions from cosmic rays, from the
sun, from exploding stars known as supernovas, and from the decay
of other particles that make up every nucleus of every atom that
exists.
The eagerly awaited neutrino discoveries were announced Thursday
from Japan, where scientists from all over the world were gathered
to hear the news and to describe their own experiments hunting down
the elusive particles.
Scientists have been trying to study the neutrinos that zip
unscathed through Earth by capturing them in deep mines or creating
them though violent nuclear collisions at some of the world's
biggest atom-smashers.
 They are so fantastically small, so nearly weightless and so
electrically neutral that trillions of them can zip through every
human body every day without being felt. Even more of them
constantly stream unchanged through Earth without altering anything except, of course, when a few are trapped inside detection
devices like the one in Japan.
Filled with 121/2 tons of highly purified water and surrounded
by 13,000 photomultiplier tubes and electronic data recorders, the
chamber insulated from any possible interference by other nuclear
particles captured a few elusive neutrinos that had been created
by the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth's atmosphere. The
experiment then detected their oscillation rate from one state to
another as the changes yielded tiny flashes of radiant energy.
