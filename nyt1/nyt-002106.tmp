Atwood and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman led an
observation team on a three-day tour to assess U.S. assistance to
Mexican firefighters.
The team visited the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, where about
half of the country's wildfires are concentrated.
The hot spot remains the Chimalapas jungle preserve in Oaxaca,
where more than 1,700 firefighters are pitted against a network of
blazes in roadless, jungle-clad ravines.
Atwood and Glickman spoke of the scale of the disaster in nearly
apocalyptic terms. Nearly 30,000 fires have been registered in
Mexico and Central America since December. 
Authorities say fires set by farmers to clear land are
responsible, but an intense drought in Mexico and Central America
contributed to this year's wildfires.
The practice is ubiquitous in Asia, Latin America and Africa; 20
percent of the greenhouse gases put into the world's atmosphere
annually come from forest and agricultural fires, Atwood said.
Two days into the campaign for the November 3 election, Davis
has already seized on his opponent's opposition to abortion to try
to paint him as an extremist.
Davis is hoping a pro-abortion rights message will resonate with
uncommitted women voters especially independents and moderate
Republicans whose support he needs in what is expected to be a
close race.
State politics watchers say the message plays well with voters
who view support for abortion rights as a litmus test, but may have
little effect on the electorate at large.
Staking his own claim to the center, Lungren has sought to
moderate his abortion stance. As governor, he says he would seek
only three changes: ending taxpayer-funded abortions and late-term
procedures, and reinstating a state law requiring parental consent.
