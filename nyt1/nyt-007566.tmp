Now, however, there are doubts. Is Bibby ready to play in the
NBA? Can he battle Gary Payton, John Stockton and Jason Kidd and
still help turn around one of the league's worst franchises? Can he
handle the constant questions that will come about his estranged
father, now basketball coach at Southern California, which plays in
the same building as the Clippers, the Los Angeles Sports Arena?
They are legitimate questions to ask of a kid who became a
father at 19, who has few interests outside of basketball, family,
playing video games and going to the mall.
Others wonder. Point guard is probably the toughest position to
play in the NBA, particularly for a rookie who is drafted by a bad
team.
Most analysts regard this as a weak draft. Players who are now
considered to be top seven picks, including Bibby, would be picked
seventh to 15th in normal years, Babcock said. The 6-foot-2,
194-pound Bibby is regarded as the best point guard in the draft. But he
doesn't have much competition for that honor.
Dick Percudani, Suns director of college scouting, has seen
Bibby play several times over the past two years, and he questions
whether Bibby will be an impact player in the NBA.
The question is one of value. The Clippers desperately need help
in the backcourt, but would a big man such as Michael Olowokandi, a
7-1 center from Pacific, be a better value?
The Clippers aren't revealing much. General Manager Elgin Baylor
is impressed with Bibby and thought he looked good in a private
workout for the team, but he hasn't committed to taking Bibby.
Having the top pick is not always as easy as selecting Tim Duncan,
as San Antonio did last year.
When told of these comments, Bibby gave the appearance of
shrugging them off. But his voice became edgy, his sentences
clipped. He held his tongue, but it was clear he was seething.
Haters? Scouts voicing opinions hardly fall into that category.
But Bibby isn't finished. He said he's accustomed to what he sees
as disrespect for his ability.
He is not worried, he said, about competing with the Paytons,
the Stocktons and the Kidds. He is not worried about his ability to
run a team, to make his teammates better, to handle the pressure.
He thinks he'll reward the general manager who puts a basketball,
and a team, in his hands.
