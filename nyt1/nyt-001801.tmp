Hours before Holyfield faces a plow horse of a challenger at
Madison Square Garden, Desormeaux will attempt to ride Real Quiet
to racing's 12th Triple Crown in the 130th running of the Belmont
Stakes. Since no one this year heralded the horse as the second
coming of Secretariat and the field of distinguished contenders has
worn down to a whisper, Real Quiet's place in history has,
prematurely, become a clubhouse argument waiting to happen.
Can the name of a horse that won two of his first 12 races be
mentioned in the same breath as decorated Triple Crown winners such
as Affirmed? A clue, a potential affirmative, can be found in the
man visited Thursday by Kent Desormeaux.
Go back a few years. Who rated Holyfield as much more than
rugged, earnest and about as easy to hit as a heavy bag? How many
recommended that he retire before absorbing the blow that would
slur more than his speech? Two overhyped fights later against a
fading ex-con, Holyfield has negotiated, like Donald Trump, his way
into boxing lore, as its unflinching Real Deal.
Dignity. Durability. Longevity. Joe Frazier had strengths
similar to those that have served Holyfield so well, but they
weren't nearly enough to measure up to Muhammad Ali. Holyfield is
not held accountable for those who were unable to persevere and
challenge him now, like Riddick Bowe, or for those who simply do
not exist. Nor should he be. He can only compete against the
competitors and conditions that confront him.
Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, hobbled on crutches out of
his barn early Thursday to praise the horse that has won two of
three. Walden broke his right foot playing pickup basketball last
week with Julie Krone's husband at Monmouth Park. He has seven
screws and a plate in his foot. Mishaps happen, to horses and their
trainers. Walden is working, anyway. Victory Gallop was second
(barely) in the Kentucky Derby, second (distantly) in the
Preakness. There is one more chance to deny Real Quiet his prize.
If Bob Baffert's horse wins again, then Walden said there should be
no denying Real Quiet his rightful Triple Crown fame.
With people, we tend to chalk this process up as delayed
development: athletes who mature, like wine. Come to think of it,
Michael Jordan was hardly in such rarified air as a college player
at North Carolina. Scottie Pippen, John Stockton and Karl Malone
were fleeting thoughts in Dick Vitale's brain.
Sometimes, of course, great things are achieved by athletes who
are just very good. David Wells pitched a perfect game. Roger Maris
hit 61 home runs. He isn't in the Hall of Fame but it is his
162-game pace that has been the standard now for 37 years. Bottom
line: that's about as real as any deal gets.
Slobodan Milosevic, perhaps the most incompetent nationalist in
modern history, continues to hack away at what is left of
Yugoslavia.
On May 31 voters in tiny Montenegro, which, with Serbia, is all
that is left of the Yugoslav federation, strongly backed their
reformist president, who no longer recognizes the authority of
Yugoslavia's government. The next step may be a referendum on
independence.
Meanwhile, Milosevic is stepping up his war on separatists in
Kosovo, Serbia's Albanian-speaking province. Over 200 people have
been killed this year, perhaps 40 this week. Refugees are streaming
out of Kosovo. Young Albanians eager to join up with the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army are streaming in.
