BBO-SELIG-COMMENT (Undated) Bud Selig keeps saying he doesn't
want to be baseball's fulltime commissioner. But don't be surprised
when he accepts it. By Larry Whiteside.
BEIJING Every Friday afternoon, dozens of late-model cars pull
up to the iron gate of the 3-year-old 21st-Century Experimental
School, one of this city's new private schools.
In a city where sturdy black bicycles are still the favored mode
of transportation and horse-drawn carts ply the streets, men in
suits and women wearing diamonds alight from Fords, Jeeps and BMWs,
rushing excitedly into the building to pick up their children some as young as 5 who board at the school from Monday to Friday
at a cost of $2,000 a year.
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of communism, the last few
years have seen the a stunning growth of a flourishing Chinese
middle class. Ten years ago, this group did not exist, but now its
core of independent businessmen has been joined by a growing number
of private-sector lawyers, artists and employees of joint-venture
companies.
It is first defined by what its members have: computers,
microwaves, interior decorators and, increasingly, cars and homes.
On Saturday nights they go to concerts and in winter they vacation
in Thailand. But the rapid accumulation of material things has left
its psychological mark as well, infusing this group with a kind of
independence, and carefree optimism, that has not existed in China
for decades.
There is no one statistic that defines this group, which broadly
includes both company presidents (who seem to have it all) and
graduating college students who've just bought their first computer
(and want it all, someday). They are people who work hard for what
they achieve, for the most part without the family ties to the
Communist Party leadership that have long defined China's most
privileged class.
The group portrait is best created like a pointillist painting
from scores of small facts: 10 years ago, 95 percent of passengers
on airline flights in China were foreigners, but today, 95 percent
are Chinese. In 1990 there were no cellular phones in China, now
there are almost 17 million.
The middle class is admired by college students who hope to join
its ranks and, as of last year, has even been embraced by the
Communist Party for its contributions to China's modernization. The
Chinese government has even arranged for President Clinton to meet
private businessmen during his state visit, which begins next week.
Last year, Fang was sent to represent China at an international
business conference and was tapped to be a delegate to the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body of
distinguished non-Communist Party members.
Fang and his wife, who teaches at Beijing University, each have
their own cars. For next year's vacation, they are deliberating
between Europe and Australia. They have donated money to establish
university scholarships and children's libraries in Beijing, among
other causes. And, although they now live in a one-bedroom
apartment provided by Beijing University, they are contemplating
ownership once they have a child.
