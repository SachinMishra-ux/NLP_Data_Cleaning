That could be telling, particularly in the area of pitching to
shore up a fragile staff that just got weaker with Mike Hampton's
stay on the disabled list. New stadiums and high-priced talent go
hand in hand, or arm in arm. Is there any wonder that Houston's
Darryl Kile defected in the off-season for $24 million over three
years to Colorado, where the air is thin but the crowds are thick?
Chances are you won't see the Astros pull off the type of deal
to bring Curt Schilling or Randy Johnson to town, but it might free
up McLane to shell out for Pete Harnisch or Bret Saberhagen before
the July 31 trading deadline. Both of those, however, are more
suspect than saviors. Same for the usual late- summer cast of
castoffs like Mike Morgan or Bob Tewksbury.
Halama, a rakish lefty, was overwhelmed in his first stint with
the Astros to start the season but has recovered nicely in the
minors with a 6-1 record, 3.15 earned run average and six walks in
54 innings. Elarton has won nine games and given up only 71 hits in
92 innings. But I'd send them both packing in a New Orleans minute
to get Johnson.
Smith, though, sounds like a man who prefers to stand pat, in
part because the team's $39 million payroll is still more bloated
than McLane desires after $100 million of red ink in six years.
Hampton, out with a strained groin, is expected to miss only two
starts. Shane Reynolds is 5-1 over his last seven starts with a
2.56 ERA. Until Tuesday's seven-walk game, Pete Schourek has
pitched more than adequately, and Sean Bergman has an outstanding
3.00 ERA.
Assuming Hampton rebounds with no dropoff, the Astros certainly
have enough pitching to hold off the Cubs, Brewers and surprising
Pirates in the Central. But it's doubtful they can best the Braves'
staff of Cy Youngs without an in- season transfusion.
Amen to that. After all, who in March would have dared think
Jose Lima would become the National League's first six-game winner
in May? The animated, 25-year-old right-hander threw seven strong,
fist-pumping innings Wednesday and Houston rallied for a 6-5 win.
He was right on both counts. His offense, even with a struggling
Jeff Bagwell, has been better than good. And his pitching has been
incredible, its current 3.54 ERA the third-lowest in the league.
Dierker could even deserve early manager of the year
consideration, given Bagwell's year and a pitching staff
three-fifths of which was lost to injury and free agency. Ramon
Garcia and Chris Holt have been disabled all season. Garcia's
probably done and Holt won't be available until at least late
August.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Tired of scanning the tabloids while
waiting in line at the supermarket? Next time, try scanning your
groceries.
Anne O'Connor did Wednesday morning. In a few minutes, she
scanned $31.02 in granola bars, ice cream and other groceries and
got a printed bill. The price of each item was displayed on a
screen and read off by a silky voice.
