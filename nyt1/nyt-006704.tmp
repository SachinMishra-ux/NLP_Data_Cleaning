PRISTINA, Yugoslavia After taking losses in their fight with
the Yugoslav military, separatist rebels in Kosovo Province have
been bolstered by a huge infusion of weapons and fighters from
Albania and have begun to hit back in recent days, Western
diplomats say.
Guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army have set up roadblocks
on key roads in the province, setting off frequent clashes with the
Serb forces, the diplomats say. There are also daily skirmishes
near Serb police checkpoints.
In response to the increased fighting, the Serbs have been
forced to move in huge, unwieldy convoys of troops, the diplomats
say. Between 40,000 and 50,000 Serb soldiers and special police
forces are now deployed in the province.
Rebel bands control as much as 40 percent of the province, and
the ranks of the guerrillas have swelled since March from a few
hundred fighters to more than 3,000. Weapons, carried by pack
horses and mules, can be seen arriving nightly across the rugged
border with Albania. There seems to be no shortage of volunteers to
join the burgeoning separatist army.
In Kosovo Province, the whir of helicopters ferrying wounded
Serbs to army hospitals, and the grim sounds of automatic fire and
mortar rounds can be heard just a few miles from Pristina, the
provincial capital. More than 300 people are said to have died in
the fighting this year, and many suspect that the casualty figures
may be much higher.
As the situation spins out of control, many Western diplomats,
while calling for negotiations, now concede that the only hope of
ending the war will have to come from outside.
The Yugoslav government, in a move that brings it closer to an
armed confrontation with NATO, said Thursday that it would not
comply with demands to withdraw some forces from Kosovo and halt
the attacks against ethnic Albanians that have driven tens of
thousands of people from their homes.
The decision by Milosevic to defy the international community
seems certain to foretell another round of fighting in the province
and will make it difficult for NATO commanders to back away from
threatened air strikes, according to Western diplomats. Any attacks
could push Washington into the center of another Balkan conflict,
this time against a Yugoslav military equipped with sophisticated
anti-aircraft systems and a large air force.
Included in the Serb forces is a notorious Yugoslav Special
Operations Unit known as the JSO, which was involved in some of the
worst atrocities of the war in Bosnia.
Its troops have been using an armored personnel carrier in
Kosovo that was seized from Dutch U.N. peacekeepers during the Serb
massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, according to
Dutch diplomats. Its force of a few hundred men are used to carry
out commando raids, and its presence in Kosovo is seen by many
outsiders as an indication that new attacks are being prepared by
Belgrade against rebel strongholds.
