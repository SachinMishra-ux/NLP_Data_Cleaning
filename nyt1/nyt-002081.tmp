Officials may announce then how the United States intends to
help Mexico reforest burned areas. Especially hard-hit is the
Chimalapas reserve, a stop for many migratory birds for the United
States and home to hundreds of the world's most endangered plants.
He warned that continued cooperation is needed to prepare for
more disasters attributed to El Nino. Next year, Atwood said, the
weather phenomenon could present reverse weather patterns, causing
flooding in Mexico and other regions hit by drought and fire this
year.
Glickman defended Mexico's attempts to control its forest fires,
which began last January and have become the worst in more than
half a century.
Atwood said an assessment of this year's forest-fire crisis
would also include the experience of Central American countries,
where U.S. aid was also sent to help fight similar blazes.
Also up for review, the two U.S. officials said, are various
countries' attempts to reduce the practice of slash-and-burn
agriculture.
In Mexico, government officials blamed the traditional practice
for sparking many of this year's forest fires. Peasant groups in
Mexico reacted angrily to the charges, arguing that many farmers
are so poor they have little alternative to the practice.
Normally, burning land in preparation for planting is controlled
by farmers, who rely on spring rains to help extinguish flames.
This year, however, many of the fires raged out of control because
of the extreme heat and lack of rain.
Glickman, who met with Mexico's Minister of Agriculture while
here, agreed that poverty is the main culprit for slash-and-burn
farming that is devouring forests and causing fires that pollute
air elsewhere around the globe.
He's won five NBA championship rings. He's silenced critics who
said his movie theaters in Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles would
bomb. He's even beaten oddsmakers predicting he'd be dead by now,

AIDS.
Brewer says no subject will be off-limits and that Johnson
