The man, who was a friend of the woman who rented the apartment,
fled immediately, the police said. Miss Slade was pronounced dead
at the scene, the police said.
Detectives from the 67th Precinct were still trying to find the
man and talk to him Sunday night. The police identified him only as
41 years old.
At the apartment where Miss Slade was shot, in a well-kept
building called the Lenox Court, a radio was playing inside, but no
one would come to the door to discuss the shooting.
NEW YORK Nestled among the mammoth numbers in the budget
passed by the City Council last week are page after page of small
ones: $500 to the Actors Company Theater, $3,000 to the Brooklyn
Puerto Rican Day Parade, $3,125 to the Shore Garden Club.
Member items have long been a way for the Council leaders to
reward favored members and punish troublesome ones. Each of the
council's 44 Democrats was allowed to dole out at least $80,000 to
groups, while the 7 Republicans learned Friday that they had been
cut back to $50,000. The system makes most members happy, so few
talk about it.
As the mayor suggested with his comments on Saturday, members do
take their items very personally. A frenzy erupted in the
high-ceilinged Council hearing room when the budget packets were
passed out at lunchtime on Friday, as Council members holed up in
bay windows and side rooms to check to be sure all their items were
included. Aides bearing cellular phones and takeout food peeked
over their shoulders.
Councilman Victor Robles, D-Brooklyn, whipped out a yellow
highlighter. Councilwoman Julia Harrison, a D-Queens, made a list
and checked it twice on an envelope. And Councilwoman Una Clarke, a
D-Brooklyn, huddled with a calculator and an aide from the Council
Finance Division.
The member items have often been used to please most Council
members just before the budget vote, and to punish others out of
step with the leadership. In the past, for instance, items for
liberal and progressive Democrats were cut by the party's centrist
leaders. This year, Council leaders said that when a Republican's
member items were reduced, the money was spread around in the
punished member's district, so that the district gets the money but
the member cannot claim credit for it.
NEW YORK For more than a year, Rep. Edolphus Towns, a 16-year
member of Congress from Brooklyn, has been certain he would face
some well-connected opposition in the Democratic primary this year.
His only uncertainty was who that opponent would be.
Last week, Towns found out. Barry Ford, a 35-year-old lawyer
with the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen Hamilton, announced that
he would seek to unseat Towns in the Sept. 15 primary. Although
Ford is as much a political novice as Towns is an experienced
political maneuverer, his insurgent candidacy is nonetheless
receiving a great deal of attention among Brooklyn politicians and
analysts.
