The basic shirt can be purchased at garage sales for a song and
in couture departments at three figure prices. It is the
quintessential wardrobe staple. It's an item for all seasons. And
most closets have at least a couple tucked in the back.
They tend to be sleek and short so that they don't bulge over
the hips under a pair of trousers or skirts. (To update your old
ones, crop them at the hips or relegate them to the role of
swimsuit cover-up or tunic for skinny pants.)
For summer, many are revamped in a variety of textiles and
shapes. Donna Karan did a shirt in white organza. White washable
linen shirts come from Kiko at less than $55. Emanuel has a trim
linen tunic.
Certainly, for most people, the white shirt conjures memories: a
round collared blouse slipped under a school jumper, a white
monogram button-down from college days, a first work shirt and a
boyfriend's shirt slipped over jeans on a Sunday morning.
But well beyond modern times, the shirt has had a significant
history in the fashion archives. For women, it began in the late
18th century when they first appropriated men's riding gear for
their own outings. At the end of the 19th century, as sportswomen,
secretaries and shopkeepers moved out into the world, they emulated
the men's tailored style.
They wore shirtwaists or shirts often with tailored coats and
boaters. But they also wore corsets and petticoats underneath,
Alison Lurie notes in her 1980 book, The Language of Clothes. They
were liberated from the waist up.
In the '20s the shirt took on the Buster Brown and Peter Pan
collars. In the '30s Marlene Dietrich gave men's clothing such as
the shirt and tie an elegance, sophistication and knockout
sexuality.
But soon after, the dress-for-success philosophy that held that
women could be more effective in the workplace if they dressed in
manly fashion arrived. It ushered in the no-nonsense button-down
cotton shirts, often decked with little silk scarf ties.
And so it went. In the '80s and '90s, the shirt still hasn't
lost its classic, good-to-have handy status, whether it flapped
over Karl Lagerfeld's tights in '87 or peered from beneath a power
suit or tucked into Gap khakis in the '90s.
As for guidelines for the shirt today, buy the best quality you
can afford. If it's cotton, keep the shirt sleek with minimal
jewelry. If in a fancier fabric, it may be embellished for after
five.
