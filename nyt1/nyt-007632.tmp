Organizers of the showing, after ten minutes of soccer action
had been missed, convinced the police to let the broadcast
continue. They then flashed lights on and off as they implored the
crowd to hush whenever cheering got loud, warning that the police
could return any minute.
Minutes after the victory, however, smiling police leaned on
their cars cross-armed, watching youths climb tall street lights in
celebration. Thousands of police had been deployed across the city,
but there were no immediate reports that any interfered with the
celebrations.
They have closely followed the cautious offers of dialogue that
their new moderate President Mohammad Khatami has exchanged with
President Bill Clinton.
One woman, pressing the limits by joining a spontaneous all-male
parade, shouted her thanks to the bemused and for once not feared police.
But generally, the jubilation was more about a love for soccer
and a needed emotional release in what can be a sterile society.
The hard-fought first round battle in Lyon was more than just a
confrontation between two global foes. Rather, the victory provided
a chance for Iranians to celebrate a slow emergence from world
isolation and to test freedoms cautiously advocated by a
charismatic new president.
Earlier Sunday, a the second day of the work week here, many
Iranians were disappointed to see their hard-line parliament
impeach one of the key reformers in the cabinet of President
Khatami. It was the latest maneuver in the struggle between the
country's conservative and moderate factions.
But, the Iranian soccer team, the first to make the World Cup
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, won the day with its triumph.
The street celebrations were the third in just over a year others were held when the team qualified for the tournament and
after the election of Khatami.
The night began calmly. Traffic was heavy as people prepared for
the game and it seemed that boys were playing soccer in makeshift
goals on nearly every vacant lot or alley.
