As the son of a general in the British army, Welch seems to have
gravitated to aviation in part as an act of rebellion against the
father who had named him Patrick Palles Lorne Ephinstone Welch.
After secondary schooling at Stowe, Welch, who had an instinct
for solving technical problems but no formal training as an
engineer, worked with both marine and aircraft engines, designed
and built a sailing dinghy and flew gilders before joining the
Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve just in time to qualify as a
flight instructor at the outbreak of war in 1939.
He might have remained safely on training duty if, in May 1942,
the British had not announced plans to launch 1,000 bomber raids on
Nazi Germany, a strategy that required the services of virtually
every military plane and pilot.
Welch first fell into German hands in 1942, when his plane
crash-landed in a field in the Netherlands during his fourth
mission. Rather than flee, Welch chose to remain with his injured
bombardier and allowed himself to be taken prisoner. After the
wounded flier had been taken to a hospital, Welch made a bid for
freedom, breaking away at the Amsterdam train station. But, when
his pursuers fired into the crowd, he gave himself up in order to
save the lives of the civilians.
Of the 76 men who made their way through Harry the night of
March 24, 1944, only 3 made it safely to freedom. Of the 73 who
were recaptured, 50 were summarily executed on direct orders from
Hitler, an atrocity that was avenged after the war when the
executioners were caught and hanged for war crimes.
For all his contribution to the great escape, Welch was not
among those who went through the tunnel. Months earlier, on June
16, 1943, he and 23 other officers pretending to be on delousing
duty had simply walked out through the main gate, wearing fake
German uniforms made in a secret prison tailor shop.
A week later, Welch and a fellow British officer found a German
airfield and were on the verge of stealing a plane to fly to Sweden
when they were surprised by the plane's crew, who might have taken
them prisoner had they taken a closer look at their uniforms.
The next day the pair made a second attempt to steal a plane and
this time they were taken prisoner and packed off to Colditz.
With its high thick walls soaring above mountain bluffs and with
more guards than prisoners, Colditz was considered escape-proof.
But of 191 recorded escape attempts, 31 were successful. Indeed,
for all the German precautions, it was a tribute to the prisoners'
ingenuity that it was not until half a century later that workmen
found a secret radio that had kept the prisoners abreast of war
news.
By far the most audacious of the escape plots was the
construction of a full-sized, two-man glider in a walled-off
section of the castle attic. Welch used his technical expertise to
verify that the glider made of bed slats covered with
millet-treated sleeping-bag cloth would withstand the stresses of
flight, including being launched by a catapult powered by the
five-floor drop of a concrete-filled bathtub.
