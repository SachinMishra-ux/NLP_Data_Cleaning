Those 1,424 yards were Pate's undoing, turning a resplendent
round inside out. He arrived at the 16th tee tied for the early
lead at 2-under par and feeling pretty good about himself. He left
the scorer's tent less than an hour later seething after signing
off on a 2-over-par 72.
The four-shot swing came courtesy of bogeys at 16 and 17 and a
double bogey at the par-4, 347-yard 18th. His finish told the story
of many players' first rounds on a day when a marine layer parked
itself over the course like an irksome spectator and made
everything in its midst players, putters, coffee cold.
Mark Carnevale, who posted a 3-under-par 67, one stroke behind
leader Payne Stewart, was the only player in the 156-man field to
successfully elude the bogey man. Pate was one of the few not to
feel like the Ice Man had cometh.
Pate, a member of the first group that teed off, was at the
driving range for 3{ hours. That was nearly as long as he and
playing partners Olin Browne and Grant Waite were on the course. As
the afternoon wore on, the temperature dropped appreciably and a
wicked wind kicked up chillbumps.
All around Pate, people were reaching for sweatshirts and
windbreakers or apparently their wallets, because inside the USGA
merchandise tent warm items were moving faster than some of the
putts on the Lake Course's sloping greens.
Indeed, it's a small wonder the stares he trained on the heavens
after some of his shots down the stretch didn't burn away the fog.
On the 18th hole, he looked insulted when his second shot from the
shaggy green stuff to the left of the fairway landed in the bunker
in front of the green, indignant when his third shot failed to
clear the bunker, incisive when his fourth shot stopped 6 feet from
the pin, incensed when he missed the bogey putt.
Neither is entirely true. He had a couple of magical moments,
chipping in for a birdie on No. 4 and draining a 60-foot birdie
putt on No. 9. And he hit a couple hundred really nice shots on the
range.
On this day, plus-two hardly seemed worth five bags of range
balls, much less 10. Seventy-seven players in the field would have
given their spare sweater for that score, among them Hale Irwin
(80), Sam Randolph (80), Ben Crenshaw (82) and poor Richard Ames
(86).
Pate's range rage was rivaled only by Jim Furyk, who spent
!ital!four!off! hours teeing up practice balls after shooting a 74
that included a double bogey on each nine.
It's a good thing for Pate and Furyk that USGA officials didn't
post signs like the ones you find at the gym, usually in the
vicinity of the stairmasters and treadmills, that ask you to abide
by a 30-minute time limit when people are waiting.
