The councilman, who once directed a Ukrainian variety show on
public-access television, said that 150 Ukrainian families live
here full time and 500 others own properties, either weekend
retreats or land they plan to use when they retire. Among the
residents of Glen Spey is the esteemed Ukrainian poet Wasyl Barka,
one of many who helped build the wooden church by hand.
Few of the non-Ukrainians here know Sawczuk and even his
countrymen had only a glancing acquaintance, describing him and his
wife, Elizabeth, as reserved, private people. The postmaster,
Bernard Lehr, said he knew most of the Ukrainians in town, since
they preferred post office boxes to home delivery and came once a
day to claim their mail, often bringing him sweet treats. But
Sawczuk, although he has a box, is a stranger.
The councilman often saw Sawczuk in town and inquired about his
failing health. Hronsky asked the same question last Sunday when
the ailing old man came for services at St. Volodymyr's. To both,
Sawczuk gave the same answer: He was going downhill, losing his
battle with cancer and heart disease.
Hronsky saw Dmytro and Elizabeth Sawczuk each Sunday at church.
Last January, during the Epiphany, the priest visited the couple to
bless their house, a modern, unadorned structure on an unpaved road
outside of town.
During that Epiphany pastoral call, the priest learned that the
Sawczuks came from Yonkers, as he did. Mrs. Sawczuk offered to buy
Hronsky delicacies at a Ukrainian market the next time she drove
her husband there for a doctor's appointment.
On Thursday, the Sawczuk house was dark and apparently empty. No
one responded to a knock at the door and windows to the foyer were
masked with paper towels.
Retired people dominate in these parts, whether they are
native-born Americans, Ukrainians or German immigrants who settled
in an enclave known as Black Forest, for its resemblance to the
countryside of Bavaria. During the war, locals say, Black Forest
was thought to be a Nazi haven; rumor had it the area was under
federal surveillance.
The Ukrainians, like the Germans, have been attracted to the
same landscape, with forests of fir and pine and ice-cold trout
streams. Melnyk, for one, drove through on the way to New York 50
years ago, stumbled into a restaurant where the owner spoke his
language, bought a weekend place and knew he had found his
retirement home.
Now, the nearest restaurant is a few towns away. The only
commerce is a general store and gas station and working people find
jobs only in Monticello or Middletown. In the summer, children's
camps liven things up a bit. But ask the locals what is most
interesting about Glen Spey and they will mention a state preserve
for the protection of nesting bald eagles.
But in the 19th century and the early 20th, the area bustled
with commerce. An executive at the Singer sewing machine company
built a splendid weekend estate in 1870 and turned his 3,000 acres
into an earthly paradise, with artificial lakes, a golf course, a
church and a schoolhouse. Eventually the executive, George
McKenzie, built seven lesser estates for his relatives. One now
houses the Ukrainian resort.
