LONG POND, Pa. For almost a month now, Jeremy Mayfield has
been atop the NASCAR world, holding on to a small lead in the
Winston Cup point standing by consistently finishing near the
front.
Still, something was missing. Mayfield was in first place, but
he had made it there without a trip to victory lane this season. In
fact, he had not won a race in four years, 125 starts, on NASCAR's
top circuit.
But Sunday, in a messy, drawn-out, rain-delayed Pocono 500,
Mayfield finally justified his reign by holding off Jeff Gordon's
late charge, claiming his first career victory. Gordon was second,
seconds behind, and Dale Jarrett finished third.
It was an emotional scene on victory lane as Mayfield climbed
from his Ford Taurus. He hugged and kissed his wife, then got
mobbed by a jubilant group from his Mobil 1 team, which also got
its first victory.
For race car drivers, there are few things in life sweeter than
their first triumph. And those emotions were not lost on Mayfield,
who got a little choked up after the race.
Mayfield, who led for 122 of the 200 laps around the 2.5-mile
tri-oval, took the lead for good on Lap 179, passing Darrell
Waltrip with a brilliantly executed restart after the race's eighth
yellow flag. Moments later, Gordon passed Waltrip and began his
assault on Mayfield.
Gordon, the pole-sitter, track record-holder and two-time
defending champion who was favored to win Sunday, drove his
Chevrolet Monte Carlo to within a car-length of Mayfield with four
laps to go. All Gordon needed was for Mayfield to miss a shift,
take a wrong line on the track, or lose concentration for a moment.
But Mayfield maintained the composure he has become known for, and
Gordon's car lacked the horsepower to mount a serious charge.
The race was slowed by nine cautions, and was delayed by almost
an hour and a half because of showers. Mayfield's average speed was
117.801 miles an hour.
Rusty Wallace's hard luck at Pocono continued as he was
black-flagged for a false start, then blew an engine a few laps
later. Wallace, who started second behind Gordon, illegally passed
him en route to the opening green flag. Then, on Lap 14, Wallace's
engine failed after he pushed his car to the limit to make up lost
ground. He finished 42nd, dropping from fifth to sixth place in the
Winston Cup points race, 216 points behind Mayfield.
It appeared that Gordon, who was forced into a concrete barrier
by Wallace three weeks ago at Richmond, realized Wallace had sped
ahead of him and did not fully accelerate at the start. If that was
the case, consider the score settled.
