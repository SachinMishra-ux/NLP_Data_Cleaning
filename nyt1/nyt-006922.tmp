HONOLULU As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
