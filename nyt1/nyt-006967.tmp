The big steak eaters are, naturally, citizens of countries that
raise beef as a primary meat source. The U.S., Argentina, Brazil
and Australia are beef grillers. Argentina takes specific pride in
its cattle, and huge stone grills for barbecuing are common on the
gaucho ranches.
And as for Americans? The Barbecue Institute says steak, of
course, but burgers, ribs and chicken are tops with pops (and moms)
doing the grill thing.
Here are recipes to share with your dad for a Father's Day
cookout. Many of the sauces, marinades and techniques are
interchangeable; experiment to your liking. Indonesian satay
Cut meat into 1-inch cubes. In a bowl, combine garlic, soy, oil,
cumin, and coriander. Add meat and stir to coat; cover and
refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. Stir occasionally.
Lift meat from marinade and drain briefly (discard marinade).
Thread 4 or 5 pieces of meat on each skewer. Arrange skewers on a
lightly greased grill 2 to 4 inches above a solid bed of hot coals.
Cook, turning often, until well browned and done to your liking.
Cut to test (8 to 10 minutes for medium-rare.)
Combine water, peanut butter and garlic, minced, in a 2-quart
saucepan. Cook over medium-low heat until mixture boils and
thickens. Remove from heat; stir in remaining ingredients. Serve
hot.
Choose a slender filet mignon or piece of London broil that's no
thicker than 1 1/4 inches. Make several shallow slits in all the
surfaces of the meat and insert slivers of garlic into them. Brush
the meat with a thin layer of oil, then salt and pepper both sides.
Sear meat over hot coals. Turn it once after 5 minutes or when
well browned. Sear other side; if filet is rounded, you may need to
turn it 1/4-turn each time. The meat should be rare, though not
raw, inside.
Remove meat from the grill and plunge it into ice water. Gently
lift the meat out of the water, leaving any fat behind. Pat meat
dry on several layers of paper toweling.
In a glass or ceramic container large enough to accommodate
meat, combine marinade ingredients. Stir well to distribute. Let
meat sit in marinade, covered, in refrigerator overnight. If
marinade doesn't completely cover steak, turn meat several times to
ensure even flavoring.
