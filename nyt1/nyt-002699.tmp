Angels reliever Rich DeLucia was deprived of his first save of
the season when Erstad lost Bichette's fly ball, but he wasn't
about to blame anyone.
Many Angels said the ninth inning was one of the weirdest
innings they've ever played in, but not Hollins, who played for the
Phillies in the early 1990's.
Included among Utah's playoff losses this season: a then-record
62 points in a 21-point setback in Game 3 against San Antonio in
the Western Conference semifinals on May 9, and setting all kinds
of negative records including fewest points ever in a game and
worst margin of defeat in Sunday night's Game 3 Finals loss to the
Bulls.
The Jazz responded to the awful against the Spurs by winning
Game 4 the next day, then reeling off seven consecutive victories.
Despite Sunday night's unprecedented debacle, they were already
talking about a revival in Wednesday's Game 4.
Some players and even coach Jerry Sloan mentioned they will
use Chicago's fourth-quarter performance as motivation. The Bulls
rested their starters, but reserves Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler
took and made 3-pointers even after the lead climbed past 35.
Perhaps, despite the odds, the Worm is turning. Tammy Castillo,
a mother of three from Twin Falls, Idaho, claims Dennis Rodman is
the only of 50 professional athletes to oblige her requests of an
autograph for her autistic son. Rodman apparently sent the family
an autographed jersey and a basketball signed by each of the Bulls.
... Jordan produced his signature move of the series in the third
quarter. While being tackled by 7-foot-2 center Greg Ostertag, he
stayed in the air long enough to flip up a right-handed reverse
layup that swished through the hoop. ALL THAT JAZZ
Foster has been a non-factor, producing only two points in 45
minutes in the Finals. ... The Jazz have been miserable in the
fourth quarter, getting outscored, 67-36. ... Ostertag started at
center in an attempt to help clog the defensive lane, but he
struggled with his vision because of a contact lense problem and
struggled with his layups because of coordination problem. ... For
the first time this season, the Jazz has lost consecutive games
with John Stockton in the lineup. INSIDE THE NUMBERS
Lorne Welch, a crack British glider pilot and yachtsman who
played parts in two of the most storied escapes by Allied prisoners
during World War II, died on May 15 at his home in Farnham,
England. He was 81.
Later, as a prisoner at Colditz, the 700-room Saxon castle the
Nazis used to hold incorrigible escape artists, he helped design a
two-man glider with a 32-foot wingspan that was to be launched from
one of the castle's towers. It was never tested because the
prisoners were liberated by American troops before an attempt could
be made.
After the war, Welch became the first man to glide twice across
the English Channel and to fly with the British team in four world
gliding championships.
