You deserve to know what you've paid for in clear, concise
terms. There are times when the cost of a new part is prohibitive,
especially with larger components such as starters and alternators,
so a good-quality remanufactured unit may be a better deal.
-- To recommend corrective and maintenance services, explaining
to the customer which of these are required to correct existing
problems and which are for preventive maintenance.
Unscrupulous and poorly trained mechanics will recommend repairs
that are unfounded and, in all honesty, there are times when even a
well-trained mechanic will make a mistake.
Many customers get peeved when they take their cars in for the
repair of one thing only to be presented with a list of unrelated
items that need attention. However, if the fan belt breaks or the
brakes start grinding a week later, we blame the same shop for that
problem.
When I am servicing or repairing a car, I look around for other
potential trouble spots. This means looking at more than the car
came in for. I know the customer isn't going to crawl under the car
on a regular basis (if at all) and check things out. That's my job.
I would much rather give customers a list of potentially
troublesome situations than have them encounter a problem I saw but
failed tell them about.
ATLANTA -- For years, the GMC truck brand has seemed to exist in
the shadow of its big brother, Chevrolet. Chevy trucks have played
well, while the GMC brand has just sort of hung around other GM
brand dealerships with seemingly little more purpose than to offer
the availability of a truck should such a customer stumble into an
Olds, Pontiac, Buick or Cadillac dealer.
The 1999 GMC Sierra will, for the first time in many years, have
many brand-specific features: hoods, fenders, bumpers, fascia and
headlamp assemblies. No longer will it be merely a rebadged Chevy.
The '99 Sierra also offers some nifty new features, starting with a
redesigned frame; improved fuel economy, horsepower and torque
ratings; and comfortable seating in an enlarged passenger area in
the extended-cab models.
Sierra's one possible shortcoming is the lack of the fourth door
on the extended-cab edition. Both Ford and Dodge extended cabs
offer this feature.
The launch of these vehicles is important to GMC and General
Motors, especially since the average sales transaction on these
vehicles carries a reported $7,000 profit to GM.
But a labor dispute at the Flint, Mich., stamping plant -- where
those unique hood and fenders were to be stamped -- is a problem.
Over the Memorial Day weekend, management quietly moved the
stamping equipment to another location, perhaps anticipating the
strike. It was like drawing a line in the sand; the Flint workers
walked.
