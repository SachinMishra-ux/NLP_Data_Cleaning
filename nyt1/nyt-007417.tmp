Don't be surprised if this year's Open turns on the 17th hole,
just as the 1987 Open turned there.
Stewart's 3 was one of only eight birdies over the first two
rounds on the 17th, this Open's most difficult hole. Through 36
holes, the average score there was 4.69 strokes, up from 4.56 in
1987, when Scott Simpson's 10-foot par putt preserved his
one-stroke victory over Tom Watson.
For the Olympic Club members, the 17th is a par 5 of 522 yards
from the championship tee. But for the four Opens here, U.S. Golf
Association officials have preferred to use shorter tees and
decreed it to be a par 4.
In 1987's final round, Simpson had a one-stroke lead on Watson
when his second shot on the 17th drifted into the left bunker. When
he blasted out to 10 feet, a bogey seemed to loom, but he holed the
par putt. Watson, in the final group, had a par there, and Simpson,
up ahead, had a par at 18.
Needing a birdie to force an 18-hole playoff, Watson rapped a
45-foot uphill putt that stopped inches short.
Simpson had taken the lead with a 15-foot birdie putt on the
dogleg-left 16th hole, which is playing at 609 yards in this Open.
Over the first two rounds, nobody reached the 16th green in two,
and over the history of Olympic, only two golfers have reached the
green in two.
In the 1920s, Bobby Jones once reached the 17th green in two,
but in that era, the fairway was hard, and the cypress and pine
trees that now tower on the left had not been planted yet. Last
year an Olympic member, Michael Blewith, did it.
In Ben Hogan's playoff with the virtual unknown Jack Fleck that
year, he trailed by one stroke going to the treacherous tunnel of
the 347-yard final hole. After yanking his tee shot into the left
rough, he needed three slashes with his wedge to escape, then
needed a 40-foot putt to save a double-bogey 6.
In the final round in 1966, Arnold Palmer, who had a
seven-stroke lead on Billy Casper with nine holes to play, still
had a one-stroke lead on the 18th tee. Palmer pulled a 1-iron into
the rough and wobbled to a bogey, creating an 18-hole playoff that
Casper won.
And Sunday the leaders in this year's Open will be center stage
in the theater of Olympic's 16th, 17th and 18th holes with the
trophy up for grabs. The winner is most likely to be the golfer who
keeps his tee shots out of the rough.
