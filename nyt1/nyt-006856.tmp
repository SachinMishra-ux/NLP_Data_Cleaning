Returning to the United States, Carberry received a doctorate in
canon law at Catholic University of America in 1934, was secretary
to the bishop of Trenton, N.J., and returned to Brooklyn in 1940 to
teach at the diocesan seminary. Pope Pius XII named him bishop of
Lafayette, Ind., in 1957, and Pope Paul named him bishop of
Columbus in 1965.
He was elected vice president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops in 1974 and was a U.S. delegate to the World Synod
of Bishops in 1972, 1974 and 1976. He was a past chairman of the
Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs.
In retirement, he remained active in church life and community
affairs in St. Louis until he suffered a stroke in 1988.
Yet in their silver-screen debut a $70 million, two-hour

not traveling to a land where no man has gone before.
According to ACNielsen EDI research, the average gross for
movies made from television shows this decade is $60.6 million. The
average for all other films in wide release is $35.2 million.
If the celebration turns out to be profitable, the possibilities
for television producers who want to make movies is nearly endless,
Borys said.
But Borys doesn't think just anyone can do it. Sitcoms couldn't
make the translation, he said.
For the second time in little more than a month, a girl was
raped in the main branch of Newark's public library, police and
library officials said Thursday.
On Wednesday, a 16-year-old girl who was a regular patron of the
library on Washington Street was attacked amid stacks of fiction
books on the second floor of the four-story building after a man
asked her to help him find material for a book report, said
Detective Rocco Malanga of the Newark Police Department. The
attacker was described as a light-skinned Hispanic man with
red-streaked brown hair and brown eyes, Malanga said.
The latest attack came just five weeks after a 15-year-old girl
told police she had been raped in a second-floor restroom by a man
who threatened to kill her if she screamed for help, Malanga said.
Three days after that rape, which occurred on May 13, police
arrested Jason Yantin, 18, of Newark, and charged him with
aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a minor.
