It does, indeed, sell tickets. Throughout the major leagues,
last year's interleague games represented a 20 percent attendance
boost over the averages for intraleague play. This season's first,
brief burst of interleague action, two weeks ago, reflected hikes
of 15 percent.
Locally, the numbers last year were dramatic. The Angels
averaged 20,953 for American League games and 29,152 for six
interleague contests (a 39 percent increase), and for two home
games with the Dodgers they logged their largest and fourth-largest
gatherings of the year.
The Dodgers drew an average of 40,320 for National League games
and 47,019 for eight interleague dates (a 17 percent boost). They
actually drew better for Seattle, Texas and Oakland than they did
for the Angels, but their average for two games with the Angels
(43,691) certainly wasn't shabby.
The number of miniseries has been reduced the Angels have 17
this year, as opposed to 26 last year; the Dodgers have 12 this
year, compared with 25 in '97 but the issue remains a serious
stumbling block for the players' approval, said union chief Donald
Fehr.
Meanwhile, baseball mulls over additional modifications to
interleague play, some of which could be reflected in the new
schedule.
One option, which could drastically reduce the number of
two-game series, would involve teams facing a limited number of
teams from an opposing division. In the west, for example, the
Dodgers might play only Seattle and the Angels one time around, and
catch Oakland and Texas in the next season.
Another would involve a rotating, three-year tour of the
interleague divisions: West one year, East the next, Central the
next.
Despite its popularity, interleague play is certain to generate
its share of controversy. If the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco
Giants are pursuing the same wild card, for example, an argument
likely will arise that the Cubs are facing much weaker opponents in
the AL Central than are the Giants in the AL West.
But if baseball elects to continue on this course, it will
simply have to weather the interleague quirks.
LYON, France The Iranian players shook hands with the
Americans before Sunday night's game, handed them white flowers
symbolizing peace and even posed together for a group picture. But
friendship extended only so far. There was a soccer game to win,
and not only did Iran prevail, 2-1, it also knocked the United
States out of the World Cup.
