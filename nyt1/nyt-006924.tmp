The floundering economy sets the stage for a political showdown.
Hawaii is a Democratic bastion; the state has not had a Republican
governor since 1962. That may change in November.
Cayetano is being challenged by Linda Lingle, the mayor of Maui.
Lingle is not exactly what a political consultant would prescribe:
she is a white Jewish Republican, born in St. Louis. But she has
gained notice on Maui for getting things done and for drawing
business people into the administration.
Her finance director, Travis Thompson, is a former Boeing
employee who thought he was retiring to Maui. Lingle points out
that, while the rest of the state struggles to grow, Maui has added
jobs in five of the past six years.
Can she win? Lingle has been twice reelected as mayor, even
though registered Democrats in Maui County outnumber Republicans by
about 30 to one.
The powerful union leaders remain staunch Democrats; the rank
and file are not so sure. A recent poll put Lingle solidly ahead of
Cayetano, 49 percent to 35 percent.
The better question is whether she can really change things if
she does win. For all the angst over the economy, there is
tremendous grass-roots resistance to economic reform.
In 1997, Cayetano and legislative leaders convened an Economic
Revitalization Task Force made up of government officials, business
leaders and organized labor. Months later, the group returned with
proposals for reducing the cost of doing business, streamlining the
regulatory process, boosting tourism and improving the public
schools.
Some changes were made, including a big cut in the personal
income tax, but much of the package was torn up.
The Hawaiian economy has not fallen off the cliff. But it has,
after climbing for decades, reached a long plateau. The state grew
at an average rate of 4.4 percent between 1959 and 1990.
 By JAYNE CUSTRED c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SAN FRANCISCO It's impossible to call The Olympic Club tame,
under any circumstances. But the golfers playing in the 1998 U.S.
Open Championship who didn't take advantage of what the course had
to offer Thursday might have missed their best opportunity for
scoring.
