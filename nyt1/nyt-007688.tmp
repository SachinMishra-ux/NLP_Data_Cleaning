Dissidents also tried to capitalize on the forum by promoting
their resistance group. French police rushed into the stands
several times to confiscate banners and new pictures celebrating
the two leaders of the National Council of Resistance, but new
banners and pictures kept popping up like mushrooms. The opposition
group's influence is considered to be limited inside Iran, but the
size of the protest was undoubtedly an embarrassment to the Islamic
regime.
In the game's most surreal moment, the protesters waved their
T-shirts and banners jubilantly at halftime as the public address
system played the Macarena. About 75 French policemen in riot gear
marched to one side of the field 10 minutes before the game
concluded, but the Iranian fans left peacefully and ecstatically.
While Iran (1-1) is expected to have its hopes of advancing to
the second round dashed on Thursday when it faces powerful Germany,
at least it can dream. The United States, which has lost both its
matches and has scored but one goal in the two games, will now play
Yugoslavia on Thursday in a game that will have meaning only to the
Yugoslavs.
Only the top two teams in the group will advance to the next
round and Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia each have four points, with
each winning a game for three points and tying one for one
point. With no points and only one game remaining, the United
States has no hope.
If the United States were a serious soccer country, Coach Steve
Sampson might have lost his job on Sunday night, as coaches from
Saudi Arabia and South Korea did in recent days. But Rothenberg
said Sampson would coach the team against Yugoslavia. Sampson made
five lineup changes on Sunday night, scrapping the 3-6-1 formation
he had used in the opening 2-0 loss to Germany for a 3-5-2
formation, with Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle at forwards and Tab
Ramos, Frankie Hejduk and Joe-Max Moore assuming roles in midfield.
Sampson wanted assertive play in attack after Monday's tentative
loss to Germany and on Sunday night the Americans hit the goalpost
twice and the crossbar once and outshot Iran, 27-15, but could not
score until McBride's header for a goal in the 88th minute. In
fact, the Americans came forward so aggressively, took so many
risks, that they were left completely out of shape on defense.
In the 40th minute, with Claudio Reyna giving him far too much
room, Iran's Hamid Estili headed a ball over the head of American
goalkeeper Kasey Keller to give his team a 1-0 lead. As the crowd
of 35,500, made largely of Iranian fans, erupted, Estili kissed the
ground in celebration.
Neither would Jalal Talebi, the Iranian coach who has lived for
17 years in Palo Alto, Calif., and who took his current job only
four weeks ago after his team floundered with a defensive style.
Before the game, fans of both teams shook hands and stood
together for pictures, draped in each other's flags, both in Lyons'
sunbaked plazas and outside Gerland Stadium. In a gesture of
friendship, some fans even wore red, white and blue hats
celebrating the United States and red, green and white jerseys hats
celebrating Iran.
Henry Jalali, a native of Iran who has lived for 25 years in San
Francisco, where he works as a civil engineer said any victory
would be for the Iranian people, not the Islamic regime. On Sunday
he wore an American handkerchief flag for a cap and an Iranian
jersey.
