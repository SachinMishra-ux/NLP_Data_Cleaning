WASHINGTON As a congressman and later as the Clinton
administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson displayed a flair for missions that required a sense of
derring-do, like the time he persuaded officials in Pyongyang to
release an American who stole into North Korea to convert all its
citizens to Christianity.
Richardson's model as free-form diplomatic troubleshooter has
been as much Indiana Jones as Henry Kissinger as he has traveled to
odd and sometimes fearsome parts of the world, including Sudan,
Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Myanmar, in addition to
North Korea. On many of those missions he has often been successful
in winning the release of hostages from governments and warlords
when traditional diplomacy had failed to do so.
In choosing Richardson to be his new energy secretary, President
Clinton has given him an assignment which traditionally carries far
less glamour and less opportunity for a high public profile. But no
one in the capital expects Richardson to recede into relative
obscurity.
But even as people expect him to be confirmed by the Senate, no
one expects that process to occur without its own drama. As U.N.
ambassador, Richardson played an intriguing, perhaps significant,
role in the Monica Lewinsky story and he would likely be questioned
about it at any confirmation hearing.
Ms. Lewinsky is the former White House intern who is at the
center of the current investigation by Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, of Clinton. Starr is investigating whether the
president had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, lied
about it under oath and encouraged her to conceal it as well.
When Ms. Lewinsky was leaving a job at the public affairs office
at the Pentagon last fall, Richardson met with her in his official
suite at the Watergate apartments to discuss a possible job for her
the U.S. mission at the United Nations. He offered her a job which
she declined in favor of a corporate post in New York.
Investigators are trying to find out if the job offer from
Richardson was part of an inducement for Ms. Lewinsky not to say
anything damaging about the president.
William Blaine Richardson was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov.
15, 1947, and graduated from the Middlesex School and Tufts
University, both in Massachusetts. As a young man, he was
considered a major-league pitching prospect. He and his wife,
Barbara, who have no children, live in the Waldorf-Astoria
apartment provided for U.N. ambassadors.
In one of his most celebrated missions, Richardson successfully
negotiated the release of three Westerners including a U.S. pilot
in the middle of the Sudanese desert in December 1996.
He persuaded the rebel leaders to drop their demand for millions
of dollars in exchange for tons of food along with jeeps and
radios.
