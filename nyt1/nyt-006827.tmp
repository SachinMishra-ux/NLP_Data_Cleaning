No matter where Martin has played, on the Nike Tour or here at
Olympic, he has attracted several disabled people to his gallery.
And at Olympic, with high thick rough created by the winter rain
from El Nino, he planned to hit his 3-wood or his 2-iron off the
majority of the tees.
Waiting for him in the amphitheater around the 18th green were
thousands of spectators sitting and standing on the grassy slopes
next to Olympic's stucco Spanish-style clubhouse.

ALBANY, N.Y. This was supposed to be the year that a new sense
of openness was to reign in Albany. There were to be no more secret
meetings between the Capitol's power brokers to decide the outcome
of major legislation. Public business was now to be done in public.
And rank-and-file members of the Legislature suddenly mattered.
As the final grueling hours of the 1998 legislative session
wound down Thursday, it found the State Capitol's ruling
triumvirate Gov. George Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver
and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno once again cloistered
behind closed doors, cutting deals.
Suddenly, advocates, reporters and even lawmakers found
themselves huddled outside the governor's office, as if awaiting
the pronouncement of an oracle. It was business as usual and even
comforting to some, particularly lobbyists, who thrive on the
secrecy of Albany.
The session actually got off to a productive start earlier this
year. The leaders of both houses abandoned their much-maligned
practice of secret budget negotiations and allowed the other
members of the Legislature to negotiate the budget during
conference committees that were open to the public.
The return of secrecy generated the swirl of confusion and panic
that has long marked the end of session. All of a sudden,
unfamiliar bills started to surface, some of them the kind of
contentious ones that flash past bleary-eyed lawmakers who find
themselves having to consider hundreds of pieces of legislation in
the marathon rush to the end.
Michael Kink, a lobbyist for Housing Works, an advocacy group
for people with AIDS, said that he had been checking and rechecking
the legislative calendar to monitor the fate of a little-noticed
bill that would allow prison officials to test any inmate for the
virus that cause AIDS.
