So, instead of leaving Butch or Fido alone at home, owners bring
their pooches to spend the day with other latchkey canines under
the watchful eye of dog trainers who referee tussles, play ball,
take them for walks, groom them, put them through obedience
training and just generally act as surrogate parents for the day.
Day care costs $20 per pooch per day and includes all the games
a dog can play before collapsing in exhaustion. About a dozen
customers' dogs come to play each day, joining the handful of dogs
that have been rescued and are up for adoption. Day-care dogs must
have proof of up-to-date immunizations; dogs for adoption have had
their shots, too.
In the storefront shop on busy Ventura Boulevard, Camp Happy Dog
is nearly filled with a corral formed from sections of 5-foot-tall
movable wooden fence. Inside the enclosure is a small doghouse, a
basket of dog toys and a full water dish. In the winter, it's warm
inside; in the heat of summer, the air conditioning keeps the
pooches cool.
Most owners drop off their dogs on the way to work and pick them
up on the way home. But Deleo also picks up and delivers, takes
dogs to veterinary appointments and even arranges after-hours
dog-sitting for customers, like those in the TV and film industry,
who work odd schedules.
Both Nabb and Deleo came by their love of dogs naturally. His
father trained dogs for the U.S. Army; her grandfather bred
Labradors. Before opening the shop, Deborah was a dog trainer; Nick
was a financial manager who also had worked as a dog trainer.
It could happen. And it could be a giant ball of chocolate, such
as Nestle's new Armageddon Asteroid, a hollow chocolate ball filled
with tangy red and black meteorites.
SHE'S BAAACK: It's happy news for Nancy Drew fans. The mystery
series most girls grew up with is back in its original form, with
the same book jackets used in the '30s when the series made its
debut. Remember those early books, when the fictional teen-age
detective was a blonde instead of titian-haired and carried an
electric torch instead of a flashlight? Miz Hot Tips used to spend
her entire allowance on the mysteries each week, so she was
thrilled to spot them in bookstores again, now priced at $12.95.
And there's a bonus. The new collector's editions have nostalgic
introductions by contemporary mystery writers, including Sara
Paretsky.
BEAUTY BUZZ: Hot off the fax machine is news that the Gap has
its own line of sunscreens. ... Sebastian now makes a swimmer's
shampoo called Performance Active that gets rid of chlorine. ...
Nordstrom now carries e-nail, a cool product for trendies like Drew
Barrymore and Jewel that looks like a CD and has tiny frog princes
and other cutsey decals for summer manicures. And speaking of
Barrymore, the young actress has designed a line of tank tops available at Planet Hollywood stores to support Wildlife
Waystation.
PET PATROL: This is Pet Appreciation Week, and that means
pay-back time for all the love and loyalty your furry or feathered
friend has given you. So don't forget a catnip mouse, a new ball or
a fresh seed treat, but do forget (at least this week) about those
shredded draperies, carpet accidents and other pet mishaps.
If you have a dog that loves to go for runs with you, consider
the pet first aid kit developed by the Los Angeles chapter of the
American Red Cross. You can get the kit for $35 at local Red Cross
offices or by calling (213) 739-5289.
