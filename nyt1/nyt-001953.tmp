The Boynton Beach mother, who asks that her name be withheld,
said her son went to the Palm Beach Diocese in the summer of 1995
after decades of emotional problems. Symons paid him about $725
cash in all in weekly installments for therapy. He left it at the
desk outside his office at St. Ignatius Cathedral on Military Trail
in Palm Beach Gardens.
Citing pastoral confidentiality, Symons declined comment three
years ago when the payments were being made and later when they
were mentioned in sworn statements to prosecutors.
Three suits remain pending against the Diocese of St.
Petersburg, accusing its officials of knowing about D'Angelo's past
but allowing him in the community anyway.
Sidaway, who was first to come forward as victim and plaintiff,
has settled his suit against the church out of court. He is
continuing a separate case against D'Angelo, who is retired and
believed to be in a Maryland psychiatric hospital.
For years, the Oregon couple known in cyberspace as Hubby and
Wifey had a little secret they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
Hubby and Wifey who don't want their real names used are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
