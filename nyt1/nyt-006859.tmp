The outlook predicts Latin America will be the fastest-growing
air travel market over the next 20 years at an annual rate of 7.4
percent. Latin America's airlines are expected to add 1,410 new
jets, valued at $77 billion, in that time.
The company's outlook indicated European travel growth will be
4.1 percent a year, with airlines adding 4,990 new jets, valued at
$345 billion, in the next 20 years.
For the North American market, traffic growth has decreased from
3.1 percent last year to 2.9 percent in 1998. The outlook estimates
the region's airlines will add 5,580 new jets, worth $332 billion,
over the next two decades.
Boeing believes that small airplanes will capture the largest
segment of the market over the next 20 years.
The forecast projects seven out of 10 airplanes delivered during
the next two decades will be single-aisle airplanes the size of
the California-built Boeing 717, and the Renton-built 737 and 757.
They will account for 43 percent of the dollars invested in new
airplanes, or 12,260 airplanes.
Intermediate-size airplanes, such as the Boeing 767 and 777,
will represent one out of four future airplane deliveries and will
account for 44 percent of the dollars invested in new airplanes, or
4,360 jets.
The report estimates the smallest market segment, 747-size or
larger airplanes, will total 15 percent of the dollars invested in
new jetliners, or 1,030 airplanes.
Airbus disagrees and is planning a new superjumbo jet dubbed the
A3XX that could cost $12 billion to develop and would break
Boeing's monopoly in the market for planes seating more than 400
passengers.
While the report did not address employment, Dennis said Boeing
