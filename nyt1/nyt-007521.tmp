The 6-year-old mare set an easy pace, turned back a challenge by
rival Two Steppin' Toni entering the stretch, and opened up to win
the $50,000 Texas Legends Stakes by 3 1/4 lengths.
Fortunate Smile, the Texas-bred ship-in from Massachusetts who
went to post at the same 3-to-2 odds as Mastery's Gamble, faltered
in the 100-degree heat and finished last in the five-horse field. SHOWDOWN IN DOUBT 
Skip Away and Gentlemen perhaps the two best older horses in
training were already being pointed for the $1 million race at
Hollywood Park in Inglewood, Calif. And on Friday, trainer Bob
Baffert announced that Silver Charm will probably also run.
But as is usually the case in horse racing, there are no sure
things.
On the same day Baffert revealed his decision, Skip Away threw
his exercise rider at Belmont Park and ran loose for 20 minutes.
Yesterday his front legs were slightly swollen, although he was not
lame or sore, trainer Sonny Hine said.
For months, Hine has been savoring a meeting with Silver Charm.
Now he doesn't know what will happen.
On occasion, the Rev. Jack Spaulding of St. Thomas the Apostle
Church in Phoenix has delivered messages during prayer services in
a monotone voice, in the first person, as if Jesus or Mary were
speaking directly through him.
I confess, I didn't ask him. A man can't escape a boyhood spent
in parochial school, where he leaned the hard way not to be
flip with priests or nuns.
He also learned, however, that people make a church, not build
ings. And the nuns at St. Thomas are being forced out of their
convent for no good, and certainly no holy reason.
The church sits like a birthday cake at 24th Street and
Campbell, a monument to spiritual chic since Charlie Keating poured
$50,000 into the place to spruce it up for a family wedding.
