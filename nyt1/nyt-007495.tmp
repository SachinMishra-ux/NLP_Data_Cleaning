As it now stands, both parties are focusing on six to eight
races in California, three each in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin and a few others across the
country.
In most instances, the most fiercely contested elections will be
in districts with no incumbent on the ballot and a rough parity
between Democratic and Republican voters.
There are some early warning signs for Republicans.
Conservatives in the House, upset with a lackluster legislative
agenda, had been reluctant to give money to the committee and some
moderate GOP candidates, but Paxon's intervention has helped.
They also were upset that Linder and Gingrich urged a moderate
Republican, Brooks Firestone, to run in a California special
election.
Now Gingrich is intervening in a primary in Georgia. He is
openly supporting Dylan Glenn, an African-American candidate and
former junior Bush White House aide, against businessman Joe
McCormick, who is white.
But if Gingrich is complicating things for Linder in South
Georgia, he also is the party's not-so-secret fund-raising weapon.
Linder will try to remedy that by sending Gingrich, a legendary
fund-raiser, to some of those districts during the July Fourth
congressional recess.
WASHINGTON When President Clinton leaves for his journey
through China, he will carry with him a stubborn hope to bring the
Beijing leadership into the world mainstream on many fronts from
nuclear nonproliferation to economic trade to greater
democratization.
But the results of the nine-day, five-city trip will be measured
not in the typical markings of diplomatic success treaties signed
and accords reached but rather in the gradual prodding of China
to open its borders to more US goods and its collective mind to
greater freedoms, all as part of a strategy known as engagement.
Standing in the long shadow of controversy over campaign
fund-raising allegations, Clinton will be officially welcomed on
Friday in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 massacre,
then is expected to make pointed remarks on Chinese human rights
transgressions. He will highlight local democracy efforts in
Chinese villages. He plans to travel to the inland city of Guilin
to call attention to the massive environmental problems facing the
Chinese. And he will address the flagging Asian economy in an
address in Hong Kong.
