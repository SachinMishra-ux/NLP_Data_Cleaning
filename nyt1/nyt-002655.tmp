The appeal's prospects were clouded in uncertainty, experts
said, not only because of the complexity of the issues to be
decided, but also because the composition of the Court of Appeals
is soon to change, with the most liberal of its seven members,
Judge Vito Titone, resigning this month, and a more conservative
replacement expected to be appointed by Gov. George Pataki.
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes was expected to argue
against the appeal, with assistance from New York State Attorney
General Dennis Vacco. Jonathan Frank, the assistant district
attorney who led the prosecution of Harris, voiced confidence that
the statute and the verdict would be upheld.
While details of the appeal are yet to be determined, some of
the issues that may be raised were discussed in interviews Sunday
by Harris' chief Legal Aid lawyer during the trial, Russell
Neufeld, and by Doyle.
Among the constitutional issues that may be raised, the defense
lawyers said, are questions over the criteria used by prosecutors
to select capital cases for trial, about the composition of juries
in capital cases, about the wording judges use in charging such
juries and about whether lethal injections cause inhumane pain and
suffering.
While an appeal was not expected to reargue many of the issues
decided by the trial jury, the lawyers said it would contend that
many of the rulings by Acting Justice Anne Feldman in State Supreme
Court deprived Harris of a fair trial.
Doyle, citing an example, noted that the law requires a jury,
after a conviction in a capital case, to decide unanimously in a
separate deliberation either to invoke the death penalty or impose
life in prison without possibilty of parole; if it fails to do
either unanimously, the trial judge is authorized to impose a
sentence of 20 or 25 years to life in prison.
While she was technically correct, he said, the jury might have
been told that the judge would impose the sentence prescribed by
law. As a practical matter, if the judge had passed sentenced,
Harris might have been given three consecutive terms of 25 years to
life because he had killed three people. The defense asked the
judge to give a fuller explanation, he said, fearing the jury might
conclude that Harris would receive a lesser sentence, and perhaps
regain freedom or get a new trial if the jury did not reach a
unanimous decision. The judge refused, he said.
NEW YORK The skirmishes over New York City's next budget
continued Sunday as City Council leaders ventured into the
labyrinthine world of property taxes to patch a $251 million hole
that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had blown into their budget a day
earlier.
Meanwhile, Giuliani's aides fiercely attacked the Council's
budget as illegal. They described Council members as spendthrifts
who had increased spending on themselves in the last four years
even as the mayor's office had substantially lowered its own
expenses.
These were the latest shots in a battle that erupted on Friday,
when the Council defied Giuliani by adopting a budget without his
endorsement. On Saturday, the mayor countered by announcing that
expected revenue for next year would fall short of earlier
estimates by $251 million. The move was intended to force the
Council either to accept eventual spending vetoes by the mayor or
raise property taxes the only tax over which the legislative body
has control to balance the budget.
