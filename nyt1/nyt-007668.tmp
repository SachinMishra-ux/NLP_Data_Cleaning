LYONS, France When Americans and Iranians exchange gifts and
mingle on the field for an unusual mass photograph before the game,
the emphasis should not be on embarrassment. The players made the
gestures of good will, so why torture the American players by
talking of national humiliation?
Iran beat the United States, 2-1, in a soccer game Sunday night.
This is a big shock only if one is caught up in the history between
the two nations. Actually, the United States was essentially an
innocent bystander in all the political maneuvering Sunday night.
The action in the stands involved thousands of Iranian exiles
wearing T-shirts supporting an opposition movement, and trying to
wave banners. This was not a case of Iran against the Great Satan
in the stands, nor was it that way on the playing field.
There was no political zealousness in the eyes of the Iranian
players on the field, no holy mission in their faces or their
actions. In fact, they came out tentatively.
People back home in the United States might expect one-sidedness
in basketball, the way Charles Barkley toyed with the Angolans in
the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but this is soccer, not the
first or second or third American sport of choice. The Yanks were
neither opportunistic nor intelligent nor lucky Sunday night, and
now they have no chance to advance in this World Cup, which is a
setback from 1994.
The Iranians played hard, and they caught a few breaks on the
goalkeeper's best friend, the perpendicular bars that stopped three
American shots. Any way you look at it, the Iranians won a World
Cup game for the first time in the nation's history, and people
celebrated in the streets of Lyons.
Most of the people celebrating were exiles, people who had left
Iran for one reason or another and are now making their way quite
nicely in this materialistic world. They could afford the air fares
and the hotel bills and the street ticket prices to get into this
game and wear T-shirts protesting the current Iranian regime. And
when the ball went in the net two times, the expatriates celebrated
along with their Iranian brothers and sisters back home. The
victory united them. Underdogs always cheer.
For all that, the Yanks knew they were losing a historic game,
and falling right out of contention, like South Korea and Saudi
Arabia before them. In the past day, those two nations dismissed
their coaches with a game to play. There will be no such
shenanigans from the American soccer federation, but it is clear
that the Steve Sampson era will end after the Yugoslavia game on
Thursday.
A new lineup, new combinations, old guys, unproven guys,
questionable squad cuts, mass benchings of old reliables all of
this set a mood under Sampson these past couple of weeks.
Sunday night, Iran rushed on the attack, and Hamid Estili
flicked an artful header into the corner of the goal, outjumping
Tab Ramos, all of 5 feet 7 inches, and Claudio Reyna, 5-10, neither
of whom is a defender.
