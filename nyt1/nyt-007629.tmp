He said he longs to go on safari in Africa, something he missed
out on last year when his father and brother visited South Africa.
He enjoys writing letters and keeps in touch with his family by
phone. Besides tennis, sports he has excelled at include swimming,
soccer, polo, rugby and team clay-pigeon shooting.
Prince William will probably be spared the kind of embarrassment
suffered by his father, who was derided by the press when he
wandered into a Highland pub near his prep school, bellied up to
the bar and ordered a cherry brandy.
William is not expected to take up his formal royal duties until
after his graduation from college six years from now, and the press
is bound by the code of nonintrusion until then. But the Guardian
speculated this weekend that the timing might end up differently.
For the last year, Kocher's four-man consulting firm in San
Francisco has kept big credit-card companies and banks on edge by
sharing details of his discovery of a way to break into the newest
version of smart cards credit-card size devices that contain a
tiny computer chip and can be used for a variety of purposes
including storing so-called digital cash.
Although Kocher's intent has been to warn the industry and sell
it possible solutions, his expertise in the hands of thieves,
counterfeiters or impostors could compromise the security
safeguards of smart cards, which are coming into widespread use in
the United States and Europe.
The cards are at the center of the plans by the banking and
credit-card industries to cut costs and improve customer
convenience by replacing conventional magnetic-stripe cards with
ones that not only can act as a debit or automated-teller-machine
card but can also be loaded with digital cash that would function
as legal tender wherever merchants have digital-cash decoder
terminals.
Kocher and his colleagues were able to crack the digital code
designed to make the smart cards tamperproof by drawing
mathematical inferences from the fluctuating electrical power
consumption of the chip.
Though already in wide use as bank cards in Europe, smart cards
in the United States have been mainly used so far for controlling
access to buildings and protecting against fraudulent use of new
types of cellular telephones. But U.S. banks have begun
experimenting with the cards, as Chase Manhattan is doing in a test
of Mastercard International's Mondex system on the Upper West Side
of New York City.
Banks trust that the computer chips embedded in tamper-resistant
packaging will act like a virtual branch office, dispensing money
and crediting accounts to the right people. But if someone could
break through the card's defense, then that person could conduct
fraudulent transactions, load counterfeit digital cash onto the
cards or create various other forms of mischief.
So even as smart-card executives seek to play down the threat
posed by Kocher's discovery, and they stress that no known
break-ins of his sort have occurred in the real world, the industry
knows it must continuously improve smart-card software and
hardware.
