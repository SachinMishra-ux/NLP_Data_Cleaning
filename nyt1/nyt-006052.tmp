GLF-OPEN-ELS (San Francisco) Defending U.S. Open Champion
Ernie Els is one of the players trying to overcome a back injury.
Sitting uncomfortably while answering questions, Els couldn't hide
the extent of his problems Tuesday. Nor did he try. By JEFFRI
CHADIHA.
GLF-OPEN-MOOD (San Francisco) Titanium and muscles being what
they are in 1998, the 288-yard seventh hole of the Olympic Club's
Lake Course would seem to be but a drive and a putt away from the
156 U.S. Open contestants. But caution and patience were the ruling
values. By SUSAN FORNOFF.
MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) There's not much you can say
about taking a cold and cloudy week's vacation in San Diego (not
even that the in-laws' place in Escondido), then returning to a
hot and sunny San Francisco overrun by golfers. El Nino has tipped
the West Coast upside down. By ROB MORSE.
LYNCH-COLUMN (Mechanicville, N.Y.) This upstate New York town
was devastated by tornadoes recently. But the Clinton
administration is dragging its feet in coughing up emergency aid.
Is it possible even remotely plausible that partisan politics
is holding up help for this solidly Republican area? By DAN LYNCH.
GLOBAL-ECONOMY ( Geneva, Switzerland) In this exemplar city of
global finance and international organizations, a violent
demonstration erupted when people protested against the World Trade
Organization and a recent conference here attended by dozens of
world leaders, including President Bill Clinton. By MARCO A.
MANGELSDORF
LEBANON (San Pedro, Calif.) Lebanon was not even Jesus'
birthplace, or Mohammad's key geographical point to conquer, nor by
any means Buddha's idea of a serene place. But in that tiny country
whose main economy thrived once on the benevolence of open-handed
tourists, religion has taken the form of a dangerous country club.

ATLANTA -- The first delivery shown over the Internet produced a
baby boy, but thousands who turned in couldn't see the birth.
For those who got through, the images were abrupt they tended
to freeze and blurry at best. Still, thousands tried to see the
birth of 7-pound, 8-ounce Sean, the fourth child of Elizabeth, a
40-year-old woman who didn't want her last name used. Cameras were
discreetly trained on Elizabeth's side and in front of her hospital
bed, but nurses backs blocked any view of the actual delivery.
America's Health Network, which put the delivery on its Internet
site, said there were more than 10 million hits at the Web site
throughout the day. At any one minute, 5,000 viewers were able to
log onto the site.
Elizabeth and the network said they wanted to help educate
mothers-to-be and quell their fears. But those who logged on may
not have gotten much of an educational experience.
