As many as 15 million U.S. households already have two or more
PCs, but only a tiny fraction have networks to link them up. A
major deterrent is the complexity and mess of wiring up old houses a job that can easily cost as much as a new computer if done by a
contractor.
If the alliance has its way, consumers will be able to create an
instant network simply by plugging their computers into a phone
jack. They will need to install a special network card into their
computer or buy an inexpensive device that connects between a
parallel or USB port and a phone jack.
Such devices are expected to cost under $100 per computer, said
Cyrus Namazi, a marketing manager at AMD in Sunnyvale and chairman
of the alliance.
Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said he projected that more than 7 million U.S.
homes will have computer networks by the year 2002.
The alliance is embracing technology devised by Tut Systems in
Pleasant Hill, a privately held company founded in 1991 by Martin
Graham and Matt Taylor, a professor and graduate student at the
University of California at Berkeley.
Three weeks ago, Tut announced that it received $15 million in
new investments from three strategic partners: Microsoft Corp.,
Tokyo-based Itochu International, and ATT Ventures. Microsoft
announced a marketing alliance with Tut last year.
A Sunnyvale startup, Epigram, is working on phone networking
technology operating at 10 megabits per second, equal to the speed
of most common corporate networks. Epigram is a founder of the
alliance.
Many other companies are pushing alternative home networking
strategies. Utah-based Intelogis Inc., for instance, sells devices
for under $100 that plug into electrical sockets in the wall and
send data over home power lines. But its network tops out at 350
kilobits per second and requires encryption to prevent neighbors
from picking up the signals on their power lines.
In March, the Home Radio Frequency Working Group, which includes
some of the same players in today's announcement, said it would
promote wireless home networks, using radio links to connect
computers, printers and other devices.
A Southern California startup, ShareWave, promises this fall to
make available this wireless equipment capable of multimegabit
speeds, but the cost is likely to be several hundred dollars per
computer. Its technology could be useful for reaching rooms with no
phone jacks or mobile computer users lounging by the pool.
