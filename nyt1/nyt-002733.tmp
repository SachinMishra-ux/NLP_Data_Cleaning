WASHINGTON To Republicans intent on damning the tax code as an
inequitable tangle that is strangling the American family, Sharon
Mallory's appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee a
few months back was just the ticket. Miss Mallory, a 41-year-old
factory worker from Indiana, testified that she and her live-in
boyfriend, Darryl Pierce, would like to get married but could not
afford the $3,700 in additional taxes it would cost them.
Fueled by such anecdotal outrage, Congress is well on its way
toward overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many two-income
couples into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they
were single.
The House took a big step in that direction Friday, adopting a
budget plan that makes eliminating the marriage penalty the No. 1
Republican tax goal this year.
But if the political appeal of attacking the marriage penalty is
clear, the policy arguments are less so.
More couples actually get a break from the way the tax code
treats marriage than pay a penalty. Single people who are already
at an economic disadvantage to couples, since they cannot spread
their living costs over two incomes would get nothing.
And the cost of eliminating or substantially reducing the
penalty for those who do pay it would be huge. Many Republicans
worry that it would crowd out other tax-cutting priorities, and
Democrats fret about lost spending opportunities.
Making the case for keeping the marriage penalty is a
treacherous business for members of both parties, few of whom are
willing to risk being seen as undermining a venerated institution.
The budget plan approved by the House on Friday would provide as
much as $100 million over the next five years to eradicate or
substantially reduce the marriage penalty.
In the Senate, both parties are seeking ways to use some of the
revenues that would be generated by the proposed tobacco
legislation to reduce the marriage penalty. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is developing a plan that would give a break to couples
earning less than $50,000, including those who are not affected by
the marriage penalty. Democrats are developing a narrower version
intended to help only couples who pay more because of the marriage
tax.
But the growing momentum for a quick fix belies the complexity
of addressing the marriage penalty.
