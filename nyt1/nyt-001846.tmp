In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
It's probably just as well, given how many of today's
well-heeled sportsmen trample all over propriety. But all decency
is not lost. John Elway has spent the past two decades proving it's
possible to nimbly sidestep the cracks in the gold-paved road that
swallow up many a superstar athlete.
On Thursday the Denver Broncos quarterback retraced his
footsteps all the way back to his beginnings. The football field at
Granada Hills High, where Elway engineered the first of his fabled
comebacks, was renamed John Elway Stadium in a ceremony that
celebrated the goodwill and goodness of the greatest athlete the
school has produced.
The assemblage that honored the future Hall of Famer included
teachers who knew Elway when he was a football and baseball prodigy
for the Highlanders in the late 1970s, teammates who were sure
Elway would forget them once fame and fortune found him, and an
entire student body that wasn't yet born (or was barely so) when
Elway matriculated with honors in 1979 and moved on to Stanford.
