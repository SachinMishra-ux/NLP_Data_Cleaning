Unfortunately, leaders of the right-to-life movement are seizing
on the assisted-suicide issue as they have on abortion. Rep. Chris
Smith of New Jersey, a vociferous opponent of abortion rights, has
said there will be efforts in Congress to undo Ms. Reno's decision
on the Oregon case. As in the reproductive rights arena,
conservatives who otherwise oppose federal control are eager to
substitute their moral judgments for those of local voters when the
outcome is not to their liking.
The nation is beginning to grapple with an individual's right to
control how a life ends. A national poll last fall showed that 68
percent of respondents supported physician-assisted suicide.
Oregon's law is likely to be replicated in other states. Ms. Reno's
decision allows voters in all states to act according to their
values.
CHICAGO There is something crusty and hardened about Jazz
Coach Jerry Sloan, something that is as rugged as the farm life he
prefers. Out of this personality was born a player who used to
crash to the floor for every loose ball and defend with a clenched
jaw as a Chicago Bull, once upon a time.
So it had to rip at his callous fiber to see how unequipped his
Jazz team was to counter the snarling defense of a Bulls team that
all but kicked sand in the face of his passive players on Sunday
night at the United Center.
With their crew cuts and Scout badges, good manners and
accounting degrees, the Jazz played the part of a team from the
Western Conference typically overwhelmed by a physical East team
that hit and hit hard. When it was over, the Jazz went whimpering
away after being humiliated, 96-54, in Game 3 of the National
Basketball Association finals. The Bulls now have a 2-1 lead in the
four-of-seven-games series.
The Jazz was simply bludgeoned by an aggressive defense that
left the team with 26 turnovers, and pushed aside as it found
itself on the wimpy side of a 50-38 rebounding advantage for the
Bulls. The Jazz was from the West, all right: all talent, no grit.
Instead of countering with toughness, the Jazz settled for
passive jumpers, rushed their plays and fell right into the hands
of a Bulls' team that was driving to the basket and pressuring the
ball.
It started with Ron Harper and Scottie Pippen (two steals). Then
Toni Kukoc and Dennis Rodman joined in. Early on, Harper and Pippen
applied ball pressure that overwhelmed even the calmest of Jazz
players, such as John Stockton. At times, Harper and Pippen would
double up on Stockton at half court, cutting down on his ability to
get his team into a pick-and-roll mode. The more pressure Harper
and Pippen applied, the more Stockton unraveled.
By the end of the first half, Stockton had an uncharacteristic
four turnovers, three in a disastrous second quarter. This is when
the Bulls provided the squeeze on the Jazz. In the second quarter,
the Jazz turned the ball over nine times.
The Bulls didn't let up. Pippen was relentless as he roved the
court, using his long arms to disrupt Stockton's passing lanes and
to interrupt any driving layups by the Jazz. At one point, he
planted his body in front of a charging Karl Malone and took a
charge in the second quarter just as the Jazz started to wobble.
