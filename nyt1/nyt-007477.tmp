As people get older, they require fewer calories, Clark said.
Cutting back can mean even a small reduction of 100 or 200 calories
a day.
Joline, a grandfather himself, agrees, of course. His advice for
getting more exercise is to make it a social event. He belongs to
three running clubs and is president of the Kansas City Track Club.
Joline advises getting out three times a week to start, perhaps
30 minutes each time, and walking or jogging at a pace that allows
you to converse. You have to make some concessions to age, he said,
such as allowing for more time for warmup and recovery.
It seemed Snyderman was destined to become a doctor. She'd been
saying so at least since third grade. Her father and grandfather
were doctors; it was how the family defined itself.
She decided on a specialty in ears, nose and throat, just as her
father did, and was the first female surgeon at the University of
Arkansas in Little Rock. Now, at 46 and with three young children,
she's decided an important focus for her is women's health,
especially women over 40, a topic she thinks was long neglected by
the medical profession.
Women who understand that will more likely assert themselves
when it counts, Snyderman said. Health care for women in their 40s
and later, with the cultural changes over the last generation,
isn't getting any easier to navigate.
Snyderman says her message is a call to arms for women to be
proactive about their health care, especially as they age and their
risk of health problems increases. Women in their 40s start to feel
and see changes in their bodies unlike any time since puberty:
aching backs, wrinkling skin, sleeplessness and potentially more
serious changes.
It's a crucial time for women to take charge, Snyderman said.
Women should, first, trust their gut instincts about their health
and, second, foster a good relationship with their doctors, she
said.
Women have to be able to talk comfortably with their doctors, to
tell them what they think about undergoing certain tests and
treatments, she said.
That women are the chief nurturers in families often means they
neglect their own health while caring for others, Snyderman said.
The result is they don't get prompt medical attention and,
ultimately, their families suffer.
