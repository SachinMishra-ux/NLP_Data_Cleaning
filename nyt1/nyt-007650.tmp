Rendell also played a hand in creating the task force. At the
NRA convention, he and several other mayors, including Scott King
of Gary, Ind., and Clarence Harmon of St. Louis, met with
representatives of the gun industry and agreed they would spend six
months developing ideas aimed at reducing crimes committed with
guns but not infringing upon the rights of law-abiding citizens to
own guns.
 Many guns are stolen from dealers and distributors. The task
force plans to look into how security around guns in transit might
be tightened.
 While ammunition makers have already stopped producing
armor-piercing bullets and clips that hold more than 10 rounds, the
group will look for ways to buy back those that remain on gun store
shelves.
Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, which represents the gun industry's manufacturers,
distributors and retailers, followed Rendell to the microphone
Sunday and told the mayors that his organization was no less
frustrated with gun violence in America than they were.
But in response to a question from Mayor Jim Dailey of Little
Rock, Ark., Feldman cautioned against expecting too much from
technology. He said much of the technology under development would
render guns useless only for a moment and that five or 10 minutes
later, they could be discharged by someone other than the owner.
In an interview later, Feldman held his cautious position,
saying that any practical advances will take up to a decade to
refine and even then would likely be available only to law
enforcement agencies.
On Jan. 16 Starr's office arranged to have Linda Tripp meet
Monica Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City.
Suddenly Starr's agents descended on Ms. Lewinsky. They questioned
her for many hours.
Ms. Lewinsky was represented by Francis Carter, who was
negotiating for her with Paula Jones' lawyers. Starr did not ask
Carter's consent to speak with his client, or even inform him.
Starr has also violated, wholesale, the rules against
prosecutors talking to the press about pending investigations. If
anyone doubted that, it has now been made unanswerably clear by
Steven Brill's meticulous marshaling of the evidence in the first
issue of Brill's Content.
Brill said the Starr and Bennett talks with the press violated
Rule 6e of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which forbid
disclosure of grand-jury information. Starr argued in reply that
Rule 6e did not apply because he and his staff disclosed not
grand-jury testimony but information obtained elsewhere and
comments on it.
