 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SAN FRANCISCO John Daly was asked about one particular shot on
the fourth hole, out of the rough, which according to U.S. Open
rules, or at least to sadistic tradition, must be deep enough to
hide a Buick. He chopped at the undergrowth like a man cutting
sugar cane and wound up leaving his ball pin-high on the green for
an easy par.
Martin, of course, is the disabled golfer who has become the
cause celebre for handicapped athletes and citizens from all walks
of life for his legal duel with the PGA Tour for the right to use a
golf cart in tournaments.
So much of the first-day carnival at the Olympic Club had
entered on Martin, who had qualified for the 98th U.S. Open by
winning a regional playoff and teed off late in the afternoon
followed by a large gallery of well-wishers and the kind of media
horde that usually trails the scent of presidential scandal.
A dispute with the U.S. Golf Association over the size of the
cart he would be permitted to use had been resolved and now so much
of the golfing world wanted to watch the gritty young man with the
rare circulatory disorder in his right leg, which makes walking
extremely painful, take his own kind of giant steps into battle.
But there are handicaps and there are handicaps, and several
hours earlier, it was Daly, who has wrestled with his own share of
adversity, rolling in a par putt on No. 18 to finish at 1 under for
a first round that was stunning from several perspectives.
First, this is a course that requires accuracy far more than
brute strength and the grip-it-and-rip-it Daly toured the grounds
without even carrying a driver in his bag. Second, it was just a
year ago at Congressional Country Club for the 97th Open that an
angry, troubled Daly stalked off the course in the middle of the
second round, leaving his playing partners wondering what had
happened and eventually wound up making a return trip to the Betty
Ford Clinic.
It was the latest chapter in the peaks-and-valleys saga of Daly,
who burst onto the scene by winning the 1991 PGA Championship at
Crooked Stick in Indiana, won the British Open in 1995 and became
one of the most popular figures in the game all while fighting a
long-running battle with alcohol.
The big, powerful swing, the awesome club-head speed and the
long drives are one reason that Daly quickly became so popular with
Middle America. But maybe another reason is that he really
represents Middle America more than all of those pretty
flat-bellied boys who win golf tournaments. Here is Daly, with an
expanding waistline and a golf bag full of personal demons, who
doesn't look as though the world is sitting there on a silver tray
for him.
