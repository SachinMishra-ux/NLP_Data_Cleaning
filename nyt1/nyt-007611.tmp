Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference
after the unanimous decision that the plan had no political
ramifications and was not a violation of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords, under which the final status of Jerusalem is to be
negotiated with the Palestinians.
Albright also held a conference call with American Jewish
leaders to voice displeasure with the scheme, and then talked to
Netanyahu by telephone Saturday.
The loudest initial protest Sunday came not from Palestinians or
the United States, but from residents of the Israeli towns to be
annexed, especially Mevasseret Zion. Some of the residents of these
towns are people who moved out of Jerusalem to escape the spread of
its rigorously Orthodox neighborhoods, and who are dead-set against
coming under Jerusalem's control. They tried to block the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway Sunday, eading to scuffles with police
in which eight people were arrested.
The United States has been negotiating with Israel for many
months now on a further Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank that
would enable the long-stalled negotiations with Palestinians to
enter into a final phase. The future of Jerusalem is one of the
central issues to be resolved.
The arrangement would enable Jerusalem to expand and strengthen
the settlements and to fortify their ties with Jerusalem, with new
roads and tunnels.
In the west, the plan recommended that areas from Betar to Tsur
Hadassah to the southwest, and to Shoresh and Kiryat Yearim in the
Jerusalem corridor, be annexed outright. These areas would swell
Jerusalem's area by half, from 48 square miles to 72 square miles,
and would make room for 140,000 housing units with 1 million
residents.
