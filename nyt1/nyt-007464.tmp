Williams summoned the doctor on duty but did not call a Code
Blue, which would have brought in a team of emergency medical
personnel. Williams did nothing to help Havrum until the doctor
arrived at 1:15 a.m., the lawsuit says.
The doctor, Malti Gohel, said in her notes she found Havrum with
no pulse, heartbeat or blood pressure, and she pronounced him dead.
Neither did the doctors. Muthu Krishnan, the doctor who admitted
Havrum, said he was in stable condition, but didn't need intensive
care. In his deposition, Krishnan said Havrum had a lung disorder,
rapid breathing, swelling of the legs and feet and a blue tint to
his tongue and extremities.
Toxicologists and other experts hired by Havrum and the
government sharply disagree on whether his body contained a toxic
amount of codeine.
When Havrum's body was exhumed, tests ordered by the FBI
indicated that his liver contained about six times the amount of
codeine considered to be fatal.
The autopsy did not indicate whether the codeine was given by
injection or in pills. Christensen estimated it would take 20 pills
to reach that codeine level.
The autopsy showed needle marks in Havrum's left buttock and
left elbow, but found no codeine residue. The lawsuit said hospital
records report only a shot to the elbow.
Government experts later re-tested samples from Havrum's body
and concluded that earlier tests were misleading. Their follow-up
study indicated he had the equivalent of about two Tylenol 3s in
his system.
Further, they said someone dying of a codeine overdose would
deteriorate over a few hours rather than going into respiratory
failure so quickly.
Bruce Halsey, a Havrum friend, says Havrum deserves some answers
about her husband's death and is entitled to compensation for her
loss.
