It was true in the past, throughout slavery and the civil rights
movement. It is true now. And I suspect, sadly, it will always be
true.
For reasons that escape me, minorities have always been this
way, operating like crabs in a barrel. A decent one will rise to a
position of power, where he is able to help those less fortunate,
only to then refuse in order to score points with his white boss
or, in some cases, just because he sees tokenism as job security.
That mindset has to change. Something terrible afflicts a people
who are unable or unwilling to help, to advocate on behalf of those
who are unable to do their own bidding.
It doesn't mean that you're anti-white; it simply means you're
willing to put other's needs before your own, that you're willing
to give up something big for something good.
Maybe Connerly is kidding. Or maybe he just doesn't know that
this is precisely the way opponents of affirmative action would
have him think.

That landmark 1976 film, an eerily prescient satire, starred
William Holden and Faye Dunaway as Machiavellian network executives
who exploit the insanity of a news anchor (Peter Finch) in their
quest for higher ratings. Finch's character is an unwitting tool in
the network's plan, a human pawn whose individuality is abused, and
subsumed, by the media that bore him. He's trapped in the theater
of television.
The stars in the sky are stagelights in the film's first scene,
one of them crashes at Truman's foot.
Truman's escapades are intercut with shots of Joe Sixpacks
nesting in front of the tube: zaftig ladies on a couch, night
watchmen, tipsy bar patrons, a guy bobbing in a bathtub. They watch
Truman; we watch Truman; we watch them watching Truman.
They watch because they're lured by the mundane dramas of his
life, and by television's seductive powers to hold them. We watch
because we're seduced as well.
