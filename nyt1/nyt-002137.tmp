A: I think the church by its nature is to be open to all persons
and to offer ministry, to offer guidance and support, but the
church has the right to expect certain standards of its ministers
and its members.
Q: The United Methodist Church and some other denominations call
for equal employment rights for gays and lesbians, and yet will not
ordain them or bless their unions in the church. Do you see any
conflict in
A: The church has the right to expect a different standard, or a
higher standard, of its members. While the church would stand for
basic civil and human rights, the church retains for itself the
right to say what basic membership standards and ordination
standards are.
A: The scriptural basis, I think, is very clear. All the
references to homosexuality in the Old and New Testaments are
negative. Nowhere is the practice of homosexuality commended. On
the other side, the positive passages begin even with the story of
creation when God created male and female and blessed their union.
The Old and New Testaments are full of affirmations of marriage
between a man and woman. So, that could be called biblical
theology. ...
We also talk about tradition, how the Scripture has been
interpreted in the broad sweep of Christian history. That's been a
pretty universal understanding of God's will, that human sexuality
is God's gift, but it's to be expressed within the bounds of
marriage between a man and a woman. Then there's what's called
natural theology as well, that which is in keeping with nature.
Personally, from the reading I've done, though I'm not a scientist,
certain practices of homosexuality, particularly male
homosexuality, are a violation of the human anatomy and very high
risk. Again that would be confirmed in Paul's statement in Romans
when he calls homosexuality unnatural. ...
The global understanding of this matter, I would say, is
overwhelmingly geared to the church's traditional position. Some of
the growing churches in Asia and Africa are just amazed that we
spend this much energy on an issue they think is clearly forbidden
in the Christian tradition.
Q: Have you had friends or family members who are homosexual?
And if so, how did they affect your attitude toward homosexuality?
A: Yes. ... Their practice or disagreement with the church's
position does not change how I feel about them. Nor does my love of
them change my feeling that the church's position is legitimate and
not only scriptural, but loving. I think all of us can agree that
all persons are of sacred worth, but not all practices are
compatible with Christian teaching.
For United Methodists, the verdict in the church trial of the
Rev. Jimmy Creech was almost as divisive as the O.J. Simpson
verdict was for the nation.
Across Methodism, the Creech trial brought to a head simmering
debates about homosexuality. Creech, a pastor in the country's
second-largest Protestant denomination, was acquitted in March of
violating church law by blessing the union of two lesbians at his
Omaha, Neb., church. Eight of the 13-member, all-clergy jury found
him guilty, one short of the nine required for conviction.
