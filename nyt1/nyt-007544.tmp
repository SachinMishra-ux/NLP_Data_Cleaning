Would I have energy left to walk the children to the food bank
or the soup kitchen later? Have change for the bus back, maybe?
Even now, as I write, there is a surreal quality to it all, as
if the only way I could cope was to allow myself to feel like it
happened to someone else.
Today, two years after the loss of my son to stillbirth, I have
survived to carry his spirit with me. I know I will never be the
same. I am a realist now.
My senses are heightened of danger, of deception, of survival.
And also heightened is my sense of self, my sense of being a child
of God, and the true sanctity of life as God intended.
I know that with continued safety provided to victims, freeing
them to speak out in ways that enlighten others, the experiences of
battered women can and will be different.
With increased awareness, the old myths will fall away, allowing
us all a chance to better the quality of life for abuse survivors
and their fami lies, for those who care about them, and for
ourselves as a community and as a people children of God all of
us.
 By JAYNE CUSTRED c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SAN FRANCISCO It was the putter that betrayed Jeff Maggert on
Saturday during the third round of the U.S. Open.
Three three-putts for bogeys on the treacherous Olympic Club
Lake Course tract was the difference between a very acceptable
2-over-par round of 72 and Maggert's disappointing 75. It also was
the difference between trailing leader Payne Stewart by three shots
or the six that Maggert will face going in today's final round.
And still expect to win the U.S. Open Golf Championship. That
was what was most discouraging of all. Maggert has finished fourth
in the Open in two of the last four years, and his back-to-back 69s
in the first two rounds of this tournament had put him in a great
position to finally get his first major victory.
Maggert's day ended up even more frustrating because he started
out so well. He opened with a birdie that helped him stay close to
playing partner Stewart, who made eagle on No. 1. Even the bogey 4
on No. 3 and the double-bogey 6 on No. 5 weren't too devastating
because Stewart had stumbled as well and there was plenty of golf
to be played.
