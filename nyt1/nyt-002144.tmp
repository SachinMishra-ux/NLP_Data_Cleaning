The object sent a scare through the Kansas City Air Route
Traffic Control Center at 9:35 a.m. Wednesday one of the center's
busiest times.
Its discovery forced controllers to reroute about 200 airplanes
and temporarily ground 41 flights at more than 600 airports in the
area, including Kansas City International and Lambert-St. Louis
International.
The Olathe Fire Department took the object a clear plastic
water bottle with a disposable cup on the top and a cigarette
sticking out like a fuse to its explosives range and drew a
sample of the liquid.
Lanza declined to release the name of the contractor or the
employees involved. He also would not discuss the nature of the
joke.
He said the individuals told the FBI that they inadvertently
left the object in the men's room. It was discovered within a few
hours.
Lanza said the FBI interviewed those involved Wednesday evening
and Thursday morning for several hours before taking the
information to the U.S. attorney's office, which determined no
charges would be filed.
OK, folks, here it comes the vehicle you've been waiting for
since Dodge introduced the new Ram in 1994 and Ford brought out the
new F-150 in 1996.
General Motors finally has caught up, and let me tell you, it
was worth the wait.
Chevrolet's all-new, full-size pickup begins rolling into
showrooms late this summer, the first remake of this vehicle since
the current generation, C/K, debuted for 1988.
For 1999, the truck takes the name Silverado, which in the past
was the designation for an uplevel trim package on the Chevy
pickups.
