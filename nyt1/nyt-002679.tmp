The original Carter Family band, which helped kick-start the
country-music record industry in 1927, was begun by A.P. Carter, a
railroad worker and farmer from Maces Springs, Va.; his wife, Sara,
and Sara's cousin, Maybelle. The band grew with the occasional
addition of Maybelle's children, including Helen.
The family band lasted from 1927 to 1943, and it was of
inestimable importance to American music.
It disseminated traditional songs, established a widely imitated
small-group sound and built a set of templates that country,
bluegrass and folk musicians would draw upon the mountain hymn,
the love ballad, the cowboy tune and so on.
In 1943 Sara quit singing for good, and Maybelle started a new
band, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with her daughters as
permanent members.
Helen was 12 when she was introduced to the world over the
airwaves of XET in Monterrey, Mexico, and in her teen-age years
became the most dependable musician of her mother's band, playing
accordion, guitar and autoharp.
In the 1960s and '70s, she often appeared on radio and
television not as a member of a working group but simply as a
member of the famous clan. For example, she appeared on television
with her sister June and Cash.
In addition to her sister June, of Hendersonville, Va., she is
survived by her husband, Glenn Jones of Dickson, Tenn.; another
sister, Anita Carter of Goodlettsville, Tenn.; three sons, Glenn
Daniel, David Lawrence and Kevin Carter Jones, all of Dickson, and
six grandchildren.
The USGA, which along with the Royal Ancient is the official
rules-making body for all of golf, has decided the new, space-age
equipment on the market today threatens the integrity of the game.
And the USGA is determined to do something about it, targeting such
products as titanium drivers and long putters.
Fighting words, to be sure. But what do they mean? No official
proposal has been released, but the word is out that the USGA is
studying a number of changes in equipment rules, including a
crackdown on titanium drivers, setting a limit for lofts in irons,
banning long putters, limiting the lengths of shafts, and reducing
the maximum number of clubs allowed in a bag from 14 to 12.
USGA officials also have hinted they will have a significant
announcement on the proposal as early as the U.S. Open, which will
be June 18-21 at the Olympic Club in San Francisco. No official
decision to change the Rules of Golf could be made until the USGA
and the RA meet for the Quadrennial Rules Conference in 2000.
