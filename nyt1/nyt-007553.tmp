ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. Life was anything but a beach Saturday
night for the fun-in-the-sun Red Sox, who finally fell off the wave
they've been riding, 8-5, to the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
who treated Bret Saberhagen's changeup like they were hitting off a
tee.
The Red Sox lost not only the game, ending a four-game winning
streak before a crowd of 41,169 in Tropicana Field, but also the
argument, as manager Jimy Williams was ejected despite having what
appeared to be a legitimate (sounds like beach).
Williams was tossed for the second time in 17 days, giving him
one more ejection than he had all of last season, after plate
umpire Rich Garcia reversed his call in the fifth inning and ruled
that Quinton McCracken had been hit by a Saberhagen pitch with two
Devil Rays already on base.
All three baserunners scored after Dave Martinez scorched a
two-run double off Saberhagen, who has lost his last two starts
after winning three in a row, and Wade Boggs followed with a
sacrifice fly off rookie Brian Barkley.
Garcia changed his mind after consulting third-base umpire John
Hirschbeck at the request of Greg Riddoch, the Devil Rays'
third-base coach, who told Garcia that he heard the pitch hit
McCracken.
Out of the Red Sox dugout popped Williams, who sandwiched
himself between Garcia and Hirschbeck while posing, in language
that became increasingly pungent the longer the argument went on,
this question: How could Hirschbeck, standing 120 feet away, be in
a better position than plate umpire Garcia to hear a ball striking
a batsman?
Down, 6-1, to the Devil Rays, the Red Sox drew to within a run
on Vaughn's 21st home run and Lou Merloni's RBI single in the
sixth, and two hits and a two-run error committed by Tampa Bay
second baseman Miguel Cairo on Vaughn's hard shot in the seventh.
But the Devil Rays, losers of their first four meetings against
the Red Sox, rallied for two runs in the bottom of the inning
against Barkley and Jim Corsi, who gave up a two-run ground single
to catcher John Flaherty, fresh off the disabled list.
The loss, which dropped Saberhagen's record to 8-5, was only the
third in the Sox' last dozen games. Saberhagen bolted from the
clubhouse afterward, not wishing to discuss damage wreaked by
Cairo's triple and Kevin Stocker's sacrifice fly in the second,
Paul Sorrento's two-run homer in the fourth, and Martinez's two-run
dagger in the fifth.
Better yet, he should be sent home immediately. He should then
be dispatched to Cambridge, where he can take a look at a different
type of athlete. He might come away better equipped to deal with
his own life issues.
