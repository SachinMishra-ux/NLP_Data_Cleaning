Chand was an ardent worshipper of the god Vishnu, who appeared
in the guise of the blue-skinned cowherd, the deity Krishna; his
cult was widespread in aristocratic circles. And Krishna himself is
the subject of nearly every work here. For without exception these
paintings are illustrations for love poetry in which he plays a
central role.
In many of the poems and illustrations, a second female
character appears, the sakhi or the companion to the heroine. And
she, in her various roles as adviser, comforter, go-between and
witness, provides the thematic link in the Sackler exhibition.
While he lies on the ground, listless with longing, on one side
of the picture, the sakhi kneels gesturing before a nervous Radha
on the other. Meanwhile, the landscape around them is vibrant with
expectation, from the outsize lotuses bobbing away in a pool to the
thickets of trees in every shade of green, their branches swollen
with flowers.
But the romantic meeting is tantalizingly delayed. In an oval
painting from around 1780-90, the heroine is seen wandering off in
a drugged, somnambulistic daze under moonlight, trailing her shadow
behind her, as the sakhi dashes in, having tracked down her young
charge by her fragrance alone.
In another image, Krishna sits by himself in a kind of
spoiled-child funk on a hillside, his garland and cowherd's staff
thrown down, as a sapling bends over him, sympathetically echoing
his dejection.
In this beautiful image, the trees surrounding the god take on a
twisting, embracing sexualized life of their own, as if
anticipating the rapturous activity soon to follow. And such
eroticism, explicit or merely implied, accounts for much of the
charm of these paintings.
Scene after scene has a hectic, grand-opera tension, with
plaintive arias, love duets and mad scenes in which characters
assume codified gestures of desire and despair. And when love
finally sings out at full cry, its force is overpowering. Women
dance like bacchantes under a night sky; Krishna and Radha make
love on a bed of leaves. And in one of the show's earliest works,
dated around 1640 and from the state of Mewar in Rajasthan, the
entire universe seems to have burst into flower.
Although art from both Mewar and Kangra is well known, dozens of
other Rajput courts supported workshops and produced distinctive
painting styles, many of which have yet to be discovered or
properly defined by scholars. Women may well have played an
important role in manuscript production, both as audiences and as
commissioners of books, and this possibility gives paintings like
those at the Sackler a particularly provocative edge.
Yet in the end, it is the sakhi who functions as the stand-in
for most viewers of these paintings. She is part of the drama, but
also removed. She approaches the events as a concerned friend, but
also a voyeur, an amused attendant in the school of love.
Through her eyes we see the story shift back and forth between
sacred and profane. One minute Krishna is God, his blue skin
symbolic of infinite space. The next, he is a pouty Leonardo
DiCaprio-style princeling peeved not to get his way with his lady
of choice.
