GOLDMAN-WORTH (New York) Goldman, Sachs has taken many
companies to market, putting its prized imprimatur on the value of
thousands of public offerings of shares. So what value would it put
on itself? The answer, as might be expected with a franchise as
envied as Goldman, is not clear-cut, and estimates range from as
low as $15 billion to as high as $35 billion. So, if Goldman were
to sell a 20 percent piece of itself to the public this fall, as
some expect, it would be making a multibillion-dollar offering,
possibly one of the biggest in recent years. By Peter Truell.
ASTRA-MERCK (Undated) Astra appears ready to buy Merck's half
of their American joint venture in a transaction that would have a
value in the billions of dollars.
LOS ANGELES Want to meet that cute bachelor in the next
building who walks his bulldog in the morning? Got a yen to play
Frisbee on the beach with a high-jumping hound? Or jog in the park
with a glad-to-be-with-you canine?
Actually, the program which offers all-day and all-night
visits with abused and abandoned dogs who have been rescued and are
being resocialized for adoption is misnamed. There's no rental
involved, no fee for taking a dog out.
The 5-month-old enterprise was the brainchild of Roberts and
Camp Happy Dog owners Deborah Nabb and Nick Deleo. Nabb and Deleo
had opened their Sherman Oaks day-care center for dogs about five
months earlier and had begun to look for ways to become involved in
pet rescue efforts.
That was about the same time Roberts was looking for a place to
socialize and showcase dogs up for adoption.
Most of the dogs the Neva Foundation rescues come from dire
situations and are fortunate to find good homes.
Tyrone, a fuzzy-faced abandoned pup with a Benji-like appeal,
immediately caught Nabb's eye. She called her friend, Dana Weinberg
of Encino, and urged her to adopt the little fellow even though
Weinberg wasn't sure she wanted to take in a second dog.
If there's a major success story to come out of the adoption
program, it's Sam, a mixed-breed dog with ears like a donkey's. His
owner moved and gave Sam up; it took six months to find him a new
owner.
There's a tug-of-war game going on and a furious game of chase.
And over in the corner, one exhausted player has curled up for an
impromptu nap.
