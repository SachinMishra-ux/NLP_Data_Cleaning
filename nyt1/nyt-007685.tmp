That tactic would probably not have worked in New York. When the
Wackenhut detention center fills up, asylum seekers are sent to a
detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., or to the York County Prison,
in York, Pa., said Mark Thorn, a spokesman from the INS office in
New York.
Judy Epstein, a spokeswoman from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society, said that one of the agency's clients a 20-year-old
woman from Ghana who has been detained for seven months was
recently transferred to Pennsylvania. The woman, Swaibatu Mohammed,
told the agency that five other women were moved with her.
In years to come, the INS intends to detain even more people as
it builds more detention facilities, said Bergeron. In doing so, he
said, the agency would be following the mandate of Congress, which
since 1996 has allocated $205.3 million to add 7,364 spaces to the
agency's current detention capacity and 882 positions to its
payroll.
Already, the INS has 15,000 beds in nine detention facilities,
prisons and an array of local jails around the country, an 80
percent increase from the number of beds available just three years
ago. Yet, Bergeron said, to accommodate all the people the law
mandates be detained those who seek entry into the United States
with no papers or with fraudulent documents the agency will have
to double its current detention capacity.
When the war ended, Palca worked as a publicity agent for 20th
Century Fox. In 1950 Columbia Pictures agreed to finance his film
about the Globetrotters. Palca hired Sidney Poitier, who then owned
a rib shop in Harlem, to star in the movie. In fact, Palca said,
part of the proof that he was a communist, the FBI told him, was
that he had hired Poitier, a black man.
The film, with Palca's name removed, was distributed by Fox.
Palca gave the producing credit to his brother-in-law, Anton
Leader, and the screen-writing credit to his cousin, Arnold Becker,
a pediatrician.
Palca is survived by Ms. Leader of Los Angeles; his wife, Doris,
of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret Palca, of Brooklyn; a son, Joe
Palca, of Washington, and four grandchildren.
TEHRAN, Iran The young woman flung off her head scarf and hung
out the window of the blue Volkswagen, her long red hair flying
wild in the wind.
Just behind was a police car with four officers, cheering and
waving at the crowd. Iran had beaten the United States in the World
Cup in France, and in Tehran it was a moment for mad celebration,
not Islamic punishment.
In a massive communal celebration that froze traffic, freed
spirits and cut across lines of class and gender, Iranians poured
into the streets the moment the game ended at 1:30 Monday morning.
Amid thousands of fans gathered in Vanak Square in central Tehran,
a dozen men danced together, stringing the names of Iran's soccer
stars into a rhyming chant.
