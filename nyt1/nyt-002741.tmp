The annualized weighted estimate of the incidence of new dog
bite-related injuries seen in U.S. E.D.'s (emergency departments)
was 333,687 (annually) for a rate of 12.9 per 10,000 persons. These
injuries comprised about 0.4 percent of all emergency-department
visits during the study period. . . .
Ages of victims of dog bite-related injuries ranged from younger
than 1 year to 91 years (median age: 15 years). Incidence rates
were significantly higher among children aged 0 to 9 years,
especially among boys. The 5- to 9-year-old male age group had the
highest rate, 60.7 emergency-department visits per 10,000 persons.
The estimated 57,580 dog bite-related visits for boys aged 5 to 9
years represent 3.6 percent of all injury-related
emergency-department visits in this age and sex group.
Among the cases in which body part area could be determined
(about two thirds of the cases), the face, neck and head (combined)
were the leading body-part sites affected (29 percent), followed by
the upper limbs and lower limbs. Among children aged 0 to 9 years,
73 percent of the injuries with attributed injury site were to the
face, head and neck, while all other ages had only 30 percent of
the injuries occur to the head, face and neck. There was a
nonsignificant trend toward a seasonal distribution of the
incidence of dog bite injuries, with the highest rates being
observed during the summer months.
Every animal is an individual and his/her character and
personality traits are determined by much more than genetic
background. Not every border collie is intelligent, nor is every
collie loyal to his/her owner. Certainly, not every rottweiler, pit
bull or German shepherd is a dangerous dog. . . .
Data on human fatalities from dog bites do tend to implicate
specific breeds of dogs as killers. Of the dog breeds or breed
mixes known to have caused human fatalities from 1979 through 1994,
five breeds alone account for more than one of every three of those
deaths the pit bull (57), rottweiler (19), German shepherd (17),
Siberian husky (12) and Alaskan malamute (12). . . .
Unfortunately, data linking breeds with NONFATAL bites are hard
to come by. There is no nationwide reporting agency for animal
bites; therefore, information about which breeds of dogs most
commonly bite is unavailable.
Q. If a dog is sleeping in the yard, it is a good idea to
quietly slip by so you don't disturb the dog. True or false?
A. FALSE. Dogs have keen senses; under these conditions, you
would probably startle the dog and increase the possibility of an
attack. The right procedure? Make a soft noise, such as a low
whistle, so the dog won't be surprised. Keep your eye on the dog,
and if you must withdraw, back up slowly and carefully to avoid a
fall.
Q. Turning away and retreating quickly from a dog will probably
prevent you from being bitten. True or false?
A. FALSE. Turning and running often increases the dog's
excitement and provides an opportunity for it to bite while your
back is turned. The proper procedure? Stand your ground initially;
face the dog; use a purse, briefcase, book, coat or jacket as a
shield between you and the dog; and back away slowly.
