Starting the day at three under par, one stroke ahead of Tway
and Jeff Maggert, Stewart never lost the lead. He started with an
eagle on the first hole, reaching the par-5, 533-yard first hole in
two shots, then making an 8-foot putt. After a bogey on No. 3,
Stewart answered with a birdie on the par-3 No. 8, when he hit his
tee shot to within five feet, then made the birdie putt. Stewart
bogeyed No. 9 and No. 15, but he made pars the rest of the way.
Meanwhile, the competition was spinning its wheels just trying
to stay close. Maggert hurt his chances badly Saturday with a 75 to
fall three over par for the tournament. Tway had a chance to tie
Stewart for the lead at four under par, but he missed a birdie putt
on No. 6. Tway followed with a bogey on No. 7, then he missed the
fairway at No. 9, leading to a double-bogey that dropped him to
even par, and back with the rest of the contenders.
Janzen remained in the hunt after a 73 on Saturday, but he also
had a costly double-bogey (No. 17). Price was very steady, shooting
a 71 on Saturday, and keeping himself close enough to give himself
a chance on Sunday.
Many of the pre-tournament favorites will not win this weekend.
Ernie Els, the defending champion, is out of contention at 10 over
for the tournament. Phil Mickelson (eight over) will not win his
first major championship on Sunday, nor will David Duval (eight
over) or Colin Montgomerie (11 over). Tiger Woods (seven over par)
was well out of contention as well.
But on Saturday, he managed to regroup, making birdies on the
first three holes, then keeping his poise after making bogeys on
the next three. Lehman ended the day on a high note with a birdie
on No. 18, and he looked forward to another Sunday at the Open.
Yet so far, Stewart has battled his nerves and the course with
success. And if he could do it again, he would have a sweet reward.
Globe editors and librarians have reviewed 364 columns by Mike
Barnicle, dating back to January 1996. Where warranted, we have
verified identities of all people named as significant sources or
subjects, using various computer databases and discussions with the
writer.
Obviously there are limitations to any such review, but we
believe these columns met professional standards and we believe his
own assertions, published in Saturday's Globe, that this is so.
Mike Barnicle has written more than 3,500 columns for The Boston
Globe since 1973. His style has sometimes been controversial and he
has collected a good number of critics and enemies over the years.
But that does not justify linking him with the misdeeds of Patricia
Smith. For those who would attempt to do so, I would urge great
caution.
