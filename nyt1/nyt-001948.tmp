On Prime Time Live Wednesday, the daughters, now 23 and 21 and
supportive of their father, criticized Kurth for not reaching out
to them privately.
Kurth said Fagan had poisoned the daughters against her and
wouldn't allow them to talk to their mother. But Fagan's current
wife, Harriet Martin, said Thursday that Fagan hasn't tried to
block a reunion.
Senior Pastor Jack Humbert and Rob Brandon, owner of BNI
Enterprises, have prepared a script and overseen rehearsals. With
showtime approaching, the duo is dreaming of how their venture
could shape this community's image for years to come.
Humbert expects to sell all 650 tickets available at $12.50
each, and he is confident one of four cable networks that have
shown interest in a 13-episode package will pick up the gospel
music show. He won't reveal the names of the networks for fear of
jeopardizing negotiations but said they are based in Texas,
California, Florida and Nashville.
Charles Gates, a gospel music promoter who lives in Austin, said
the program could succeed here if done correctly.
Brandon, a music promoter, shares Humbert's vision and energy
for the project, even though he has a limited religious background.
He said he hopes the television production will help raise money
to complete an 1,100-seat football stadium for the private school
next door. A lighted baseball and softball complex also are
envisioned for Hilltop Christian Academy, and Humbert said he wants
eventually to build assisted-living homes on the 40-acre campus.
It's all part of a master plan that began 20 years ago when he left
his executive office in a Chicago skyscraper to build a church on
the hill along U.S. 183 overlooking Cedar Park.
A neighbor described Kip Kinkel as an all-American kid, and by
appearances it was so: close-cropped red hair and freckles, right
off a cereal box. But the day witnesses said he shot 51 rounds into
a crowded school cafeteria, he also was an accused felon.
It was the home where investigators would find Kinkel's dead
parents, and five bombs that the boy had stashed to protect himself
from the monsters under his bed.
Yes, it was more serious than it seemed when police in
Springfield, Ore., released Kinkel to his parents' custody after
arresting him at school for buying a stolen handgun from a
classmate.
