Ultimately, a presidential trip is global theatre, scripted,
directed and managed to convey American priorities, as identified
by the White House.
Clinton hopes to use the China trip, for instance, to try to
redefine American impressions and to show that his policy of
engaging with China economically, politically and diplomatically,
is helping to foster change.
With that in mind, one of the first things Clinton plans to do
in China is to visit a small village named Xia He, characteristic
of hundreds of thousands of rural hamlets across the vast country
that are struggling to shift away from the old ways of a state-run
economy.
Largely by shifting to market-based economic practices, in
concert with opening up to foreign investment, tourism and trade,
China has seen perhaps half a billion of its people rise from the
depths of hardscrabble poverty over the past two decades.
Clinton also hopes to underscore China's long history of unity
and achievement, while, at the same time, spotlighting its vast
potential for the future.
Those themes will underpin his planned visit to the Great Wall,
built 2200 years ago to keep out invaders from the north.
Of the dozens of sites he plans to visit - the terra-cotta
warriors near Xian, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the stock
exchange in Shanghai - there are dozens more his advance team
considered, surveyed and later rejected.
Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
