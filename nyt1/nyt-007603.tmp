A small instrumental ensemble drawn from the St. Louis Symphony
and conducted by Grant Llewellyn, moved between Monteverdi's style
and Goehr's music with admirable agility. The production runs
through Thursday.
ATLANTA In the beginning, back in 1937, there was Snow White,
with her squeaky-clean image and her squeaky-clean dream that
someday her prince would come. Never mind that she spends most of
the movie co-habitating with seven vertically challenged men.
Beauties all. Not necessarily brainless beauties, either. But
what did any of them really want out of life besides the right to
live happily ever after with the right guy?
Her personality: Yearning to explore the airy other world above
the ocean, even if she risks her life.
Moral of the story: Someday you'll find your prince, but only if
you go for a makeover, like losing your tail and gills.
Snow White, eat my dust: Doesn't sweep floors, disobeys dad and
she finds and saves her prince, not the other way around.
Her look: Proper French bourgeois who actually takes time
twisting her hair into a 'do, unlike these hang-loose other
heroines.
Her personality: Yearning to be left alone by handsome, mean
Gaston, so she can read her books in peace; smart but kind.
Moral of the story: Sometimes a big tough guy really needs love,
because at heart he's just Robby Benson talking in a deep voice.
Snow White, eat my dust: A dark forest wouldn't freak her out
the way it does Miss White; plus, she falls in love with the Beast
because of his soul, not his looks or lineage.
