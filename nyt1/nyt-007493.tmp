Another nifty feature is the ability of the disk fragmentation
software to change where your programs are stored on your hard disk
based on how often you use each program. By putting the most often
used programs in the best positions, they'll load faster at the
expense of loading time of seldom-used programs. You'll need to use
the defragmentation program several times before you'll notice a
difference but over time you will see improvements.
Finally, there's the controversial melding of Internet Explorer
and the Windows desktop. That's one of the features that caused the
Justice Department to file the antitrust suit, since new users may
never try the competing browser from Netscape. Using this feature,
you can make launching a program and navigating through the file
system very much like using the Web. You get a more graphical look
and only needto single-click to perform most functions. However,
this feature seems to slow down most computers dramatically and has
not been popular with many earlier users.
All that said, what's the answer to the big question: Do you
line up at dawn on Thursday to buy Windows 98?
A lot depends on whether you enjoy the early morning. Windows 98
itself isn't enough of a change to make that dawn trip. However, it
is a legitimate improvement as you would expect from a major
program developed by a company with the resources of Microsoft and there's no doubt that most of us will be installing new Windows
sooner or later.
WASHINGTON A key election approaching, Rep. John Linder says
he feels no pressure in his job as chief fund-raiser and
cheerleader for Republican congressional campaigns.
The speaker is demanding the latest polling data and plans in
New Mexico, where Republicans risk losing a congressional seat and
seeing their small majority shrink from 11 to 10.
A few bad breaks here and there could end GOP control of the
House after four years, though most political analysts still
consider a Democratic takeover a longshot.
Two wild cards could dramatically alter the fall campaigns. One
is the ongoing investigation of President Clinton and the
Democrats, from campaign finance issues to allegations of an affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. If independent
counsel Kenneth Starr sends Congress a report detailing wrongdoing
by the president, Republicans could be looking at big gains in
November.
The other unknown is the impact of the tobacco issue.
Republicans believe they can withstand the collapse of
comprehensive tobacco legislation in the Senate. Democrats believe
voters will hold the GOP accountable.
Still, it was something less than a vote of confidence when
anonymous sources last month told conservative columnist Robert
Novak, whose columns have served as trial balloons for Gingrich,
that Linder was being set up as the scapegoat for anticipated
Republican losses.
