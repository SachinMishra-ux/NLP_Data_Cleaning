For their debut, the Other Ones had two things that the Grateful
Dead did not: nearly a month of daily rehearsals (including a
change of guitarist in the last week) and a set list that was
chosen before the band appeared onstage. But like the Dead, the
Other Ones rely on the chemistry of the moment.
The Dead brought the security of American roots music country,
blues, Appalachian music, rhythm-and-blues, even touches of Latin
rhythm to psychedelic wanderings; they made good-timey excursions
out of songs haunted by death and uncertainty. The two sets by the
Other Ones became both a reminder of what the Dead accomplished and
a glimpse of new prospects.
In more than three hours of music, the Other Ones celebrated the
Dead with the Dead's own limber, open-ended curiosity, bolstered by
the kind of thorough practice and rejuvenated energy that the
latter-day Dead had lost.

JUDGE-PANEL (Undated) Sens. Patty Murray and Slade Gorton name a
bipartisan panel to screen candidates to succeed U.S. District
Judge William L. Dwyer, who is retiring after a decade at the
vortex major Northwest social, environmental and political issues.
Gorton says, meanwhile, that he believes the GOP-run Senate will
fill all four vacancies on the federal bench in Seattle by the time
Congress adjourns at the end of September. Although of opposite
parties and different political faiths, the state's two senators
voice pride at their cooperation on what has been a contentious
issue. Gorton is waiting for the White House to say it is ready to
send up the name of Barbara Durham to the 9th Circuit before he
moves floor action on long-delayed Clinton appointee William
Fletcher.
FIERZE, Albania The rusted hulk of a ferry, its bilge pumps
spewing water into the emerald green Drinit River and its diesel
engine rattling, has become for hundreds of young men the last leg
on a journey to war.
On the upper decks small knots of ethnic Albanians, some of the
600,000 Albanians in Germany and Switzerland, squatted and
whispered among themselves.
Six bearded Islamic militants with white skullcaps stood near
the railing with thousand-mile stares that seemed to inhibit the
conversation around them. The milling groups and hushed tones gave
the boat, which shuttles each day the two hours between Koman and
Fierze, the aura of a troop ship heading into battle.
The men have left behind families, jobs, however menial, and
peace to fight for a separate state with the Kosovo Liberation Army
against the Serbian military.
