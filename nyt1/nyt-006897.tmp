Officials at Casino Arizona said that the men pose no risk to
players, and have been approved by the National Indian Gaming
Association in Washington, D.C., and cleared several other
background checks.
The casino's decision to hire Frank Vawter, convicted in 1978 of
embezzlement, and Michael Byrne, whose state gaming license was
revoked in 1996, is under fire.
Salt River gaming officials, who were scrambling Thursday to get
the 20,000-square-foot hall ready for Friday's poker players,
defended the hiring of Vawter and Byrne.
All poker-hall workers are subjected to checks by federal gaming
officials, as well as the Arizona Indian Regulatory Association,
Jenkins said. In addition, he said, Salt River officials verify
references and call other sources.
Amalia Valencia, Salt River's licensing official, acknowledged
that the casino has hired other felons, but she said they are not
violent and are trustworthy.
Vawter was working at Fort McDowell's casino in 1995 when the
state learned that he had been convicted in California of
embezzling $10,000 from a business partner. He was sentenced to 30
days in jail.
Although records show that Vawter's conviction was later set
aside, an Arizona hearing officer refused to issue him a gaming
license needed for a supervisory job.
Byrne, who also worked at Fort McDowell, lost his gaming license
after state regulators ruled that he had worked temporarily in an
unlicensed casino in California. But Byrne said he was given
permission by his boss at Fort McDowell to work at the California
facility.
Although he lost his Arizona license, he said he has been
licensed in California and has been a guest speaker on gambling at
Scottsdale Community College.
It looks simple. The local thug is causing trouble again, this
time beating up his own people, not the neighbors. Last time, he
became cooperative only when the West, in the shape of NATO, showed
it meant business by carrying out air strikes.
