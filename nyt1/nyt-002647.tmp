All four Democratic candidates for governor have recently begun
attacking Pataki, a Republican, over auto insurance prices, and the
two front-runners in the polls, Peter Vallone, the New York City
Council speaker, and Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, plan to release
within the next few days their own plans for lowering rates.
Insurance companies make for easy political targets, as attacks
on health insurers across the country have shown. For the Democrats
in New York, taking on auto insurers has the added benefit of
playing into their claims that Pataki has been too cozy with big
business.
But a report released last week by the majority Democrats in the
state Assembly gave fresh ammunition to the challengers. It says
that during the 1990s, rates and insurance company profits have
risen much faster in New York than in the nation as a whole, and it
blames Pataki, whose administration has approved each rate
increase.
The average auto insurance policy in New York cost $705 in 1990.
It rose under Gov. Mario Cuomo, a Democrat, to $870 in 1994, the
year Pataki was elected. And it continued to climb under the new
governor, to $960 in 1996, up 36 percent in six years. The average
rate dropped last year to $954, and appears headed for another
small decline this year.
Neil D. Levin, who was appointed state insurance superintendent
by Pataki, responded to the report by saying that the competitive
forces of the market should be allowed to determine rates.
The Assembly Democrats said that in the two weeks remaining in
this year's legislative session they would seek passage of several
laws that they said would cut rates by more than 21 percent, like
antifraud measures, the appointment of a consumer advocate to
contest proposed rate increases, and the creation of a toll-free
number to help customers comparison-shop among insurers.
The Democrats have considerable leverage because some auto
insurance laws that the governor and the industry favor are set to
expire this summer, and the Democrats could withhold renewal of
those laws unless their proposals are enacted.
Grannis said the Assembly would not try to legislate a specific
rate reduction, as New Jersey lawmakers have, for fear of roiling
what is now a fairly stable, profitable market. Some insurers have
abandoned the New Jersey market, contending that it is too
difficult to make a profit there.
In last year's New Jersey race, state Sen. James McGreevey, a
Democrat, found a vast untapped well of resentment over the state's
high rates. He exploited it so well against Whitman, a Republican
to whom Pataki is often compared, that despite being little-known
when the campaign began, he narrowly missed defeating her in
November.
CLIFFSIDE PARK, N.J. The initial shock has worn off, a
schoolteacher named Joung Pyo Jyoung said Sunday, but she still
marvels at how Kim Dae Jung, the longtime dissident, came to be
elected president of South Korea, her homeland.
