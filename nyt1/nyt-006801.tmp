PowerPoint, which is used to create slide shows, is perhaps the
most insidious piece of software ever written. Anyone who has had
to sit through a PowerPoint presentation knows what I mean. There's
a slide on the wall, and the guy with the microphone repeats the
information on the slide. This goes on for 20 or 30 slides. Then
they give you a hard copy of the slide show to take home with you.
Anyway, it's going to be easier to use. For instance, the size
of the type automatically will adjust to fit the screen as you add
information to a slide.
You have to tip your hat to Jean-Louis Gassee. The former
president of Apple's product division is still out there on the
show floor, flogging his company, Be Inc. At first, Be was an
alternate PC-maker with its own operating system. That didn't work.
Then, Gassee reportedly almost sold Be to Apple when it was fishing
around for a new OS for the Macintosh. But Apple bought Steve Jobs'
NeXT instead.
Be actually could have a chance in this new multimedia niche,
especially because the latest version of the Be OS works with
Intel-based computers. (In the past, it was designed only for
PowerPC chips.) You can download the Intel-compatible version of
the Be OS directly from Be's Web site (www.be.com). It costs $79.
Investors apparently like Be's prospects, as evidenced by the
$24.4 million that Gassee raised in financing during the first
quarter of this year.
Gassee admitted that he should have tied his flag to Intel years
ago. But I guess that's hard for an ex-Apple guy to do.
Earlier this month, NBC announced a similar but smaller deal,
acquiring a 5 percent stake in San Francisco's Cnet with the idea
of eventually taking over its fledgling Web directory service,
called Snap.
Under terms of yesterday's agreement, Disney will receive 25.8
million shares of newly issued Infoseek stock in return for $70
million in cash plus ownership of Starwave, a Disney subsidiary
that creates and manages Web sites for other companies.
Disney also will plunk down $139 million for warrants that will
enable it to amass a majority interest in Infoseek over the next
three years. In the meantime, Disney will get three out of eight
seats on Infoseek's board of directors.
As part of the deal, Infoseek has agreed to buy $165 million in
promotional support from Disney over the next five years.
