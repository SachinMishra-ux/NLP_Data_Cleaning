The driving force behind those laws, Dr. Bertrand Bell, praised
the fine and Dr. DeBuono's initiative on Thursday, even as he doled
out a measure of criticism.
GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas When the lights come up tonight at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie, there is the inevitable presumption
that some of the participants are old enough to be put to stud.
At the NTRA All-Star Jockey Championship, they'll be checking
birth certificates only on the horses, thank you. Bailey, born in
Dallas and raised in El Paso, will turn 41 this summer and has
saddled more than 4,300 winners.
Bailey's record, like Pincay's and Delahoussaye's and all of the
40-something set's, more than substantiates that. They don't ride
on the seniors circuit and their winners don't pay off in Depends
coupons.
Once upon a time, a betting man might have wagered that not all
jockeys would live into their 40s, let alone win in them. Bailey
has heard the old stories, too.
Bailey rides six horses a day, five days a week, about 48 weeks
a year. He has been averaging 1,100 to 1,200 rides each calendar
year.
He rides in New York, because all the great ones, sooner or
later, tend to gravitate to the New York, Kentucky or California
tracks.
It isn't Texas. But Bailey has earned enough his mounts'
winning purses last year totaled nearly $16 million that he has
been able to buy himself some Texas-sized elbow room on Long
Island.
Though he was born in Dallas, Bailey moved to El Paso with his
family before he had turned 3. His father, a dentist, bought a pony
for the back yard.
At 17, he began riding professionally at Sunland Park in New
Mexico. His first winner was named Fetch. But his greatest winner
was the legendary Cigar.
