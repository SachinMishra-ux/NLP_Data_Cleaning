In this charade, Clinton will formally ask the Chinese to
cooperate with the Congress and the Department of Justice, and
China's Jiang will formally promise to help. Perhaps an expendable
non-official middleman will be designated to take a gentle fall,
helping Janet Reno to avoid having to seek independent counsel. And
the relieved Clinton will owe Jiang a big one.
In light of his personal negotiating difficulty, and recognizing
the need for the U.S. to exchange summit visits with a major power,
what can we reasonably ask our president to do?
2. On arrival, don't waste your mandatory human-rights message
on the accompanying press corps. Instead, insist on making it a
major theme of your live broadcast-telecast to the Chinese people,
and be sure the interpreter is our man. Meet and be photographed
with authentic dissidents and offer to host a White House meeting
between Jiang and the Dalai Lama.
Finally, let Jiang know that the next U.S. president might not
be so vulnerable to revelations of Chinese manipulation, and will
not forget any advantage taken of this one.
Baseball convention has been turned on its ear, but the game
continues to thrive in spite of, or precisely because of, these
innovations.
Over the next four nights in Southern California, a clamorous
statement will be made for the continuance of still another
wrinkle: interleague play.
It used to be that the area's fans could harbor only the
faintest hope of a Freeway World Series between the Dodgers and
Angels. During the first 36 years of these teams' co-tenancy of the
region, it never had the slightest glimmer of fruition.
But interleague play, launched as a two-year experiment last
season, delivered the next best thing: games between the Dodgers
and Angels that actually meant something. And the fans responded
about as expected.
Over the next four nights, the teams will participate in a
home-and-home exchange two games in Anaheim, beginning tonight,
followed by two in Dodger Stadium and officials from both clubs
say they are expecting robust crowds throughout.
For the game's players, who will vote later this summer on
whether to continue interleague play, it presents an unmistakable
message: This thing is good for business.
