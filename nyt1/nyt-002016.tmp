McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ed Harris Playing at: Cheri, suburbs Running time: 104 minutes Rated: PG (thematic elements and mild language) 
Not only does Christof control the weather; he also controls the
aggressive cheer level in this film that neatly turns the tables on
so-called reality-based TV as it follows the logic of turning lives
into programming. What does reality become when all it wants to do
is copy TV? Truman is the only thing that's unscripted, or rather
the innocence of his reactions is. His innocence and his privacy
are the real subjects of the show-within-the-movie, not the daily
banalities he has been conditioned to believe constitute reality in
his blindingly sunny world of greeting-card platitudes, shimmering
so surrealistically. The brave new world of Shakespeare and Aldous
Huxley has been supplanted by a ratings-driven world. Cannon fodder
has been replaced by camera fodder. Five thousand hidden cameras
are ever ready to capture Truman's every move and flicker through
Seahaven's beachfront world of Victorian replicas and white picket
fences.
Truman's appeal is rooted in Carrey's ability to project a
childlike acceptance of everything at what better for TV? face
value. He only dimly suspects that everybody around him is
different. He isn't paranoiac, but should be. Yet director Peter
Weir and screenwriter Andrew Niccol shrewdly allow Truman to feel
the cocoonlike comfort of his squeaky-clean box, the life he only
now realizes has been the centerpiece in a massive falsifying of
experience. Truman's anger, revved into action as he realizes his
theme-park world is a cage he must escape, must blast through the
passive urge to let TV keep doling out cues.

ECON-REPORT (Undated) The economy added more jobs than
expected in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent. Payrolls expanded by 296,000 people
last month, exceeding forecasts of a gain of about 220,000. April's
employment gain was revised upward to 302,000 from the initial
estimate of 262,000. Workers' average hourly earnings, a gauge of
labor costs, rose 0.3 percent, or 4 cents, in May, slower than
April's increase of half a percent. By Sylvia Nasar.
INTERNET-U.S. (Undated) Ira Magaziner will announce the White
House's new proposal for reforming the Internet's naming and
address system. The proposal will refine a plan announced earlier
this year to turn over management of the system to the private
sector and stimulate competition for registering new Internet
addresses. By Amy Harmon.
INTERNET-FCC (Washington) The FCC is considering whether to
halt the collection of money from telecommunications companies to
fund the wiring of schools and libraries to the Internet.
GOLDMAN-WORTH (New York) Goldman, Sachs has taken many
companies to market, putting its prized imprimatur on the value of
thousands of public offerings of shares. So what value would it put
on itself? The answer, as might be expected with a franchise as
envied as Goldman, is not clear-cut, and estimates range from as
low as $15 billion to as high as $35 billion. So, if Goldman were
to sell a 20 percent piece of itself to the public this fall, as
some expect, it would be making a multibillion-dollar offering,
possibly one of the biggest in recent years. By Peter Truell.
ASTRA-MERCK (Undated) Astra appears ready to buy Merck's half
of their American joint venture in a transaction that would have a
value in the billions of dollars.
