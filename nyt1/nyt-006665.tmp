Winn-Dixie opened its first self-checkout lanes in South Florida
on June 4 at its store west of Boynton Beach, at Jog and Hypoluxo
roads, and invited reporters in Wednesday to see them in operation.
The store, which opened April 30, got the lanes first because
executives of the Jacksonville-based chain believe customers in the
burgeoning Boynton suburbs would be more receptive.
Terry Walsh, Winn-Dixie marketing director in South Florida,
said there still will be lanes with cashiers. But self-checkout
lanes including the three at the west Boynton store give antsy
customers in long lines an option to do it themselves. To pay, they
take printed bills to a central cashier.
Self-checkout lanes already operate at 16 Tampa, Orlando and
Jacksonville Winn-Dixies. Two more stores in Palm Beach County and
one in Broward will have them by the end of December. The company
won't say where. Outside of Winn-Dixie, only two other chains AP
in the Northeast and Finast in the Midwest use them.
The system works like this: Groceries are placed one by one on a
glass-surfaced bar code reader that records the price. The customer
then drops them onto a conveyor belt, and each item passes through
a second gizmo a scanner that showers it with lasers. The laser
is designed to prevent a customer from scanning an item, then
replacing it with something more expensive.
If the two scans don't match, the conveyor belt reverses
direction and returns the item to the customer.
For veggies and fruit, the shopper places the items on the
scanner, which doubles as a scale, looks them up in a booklet next
to the price display screen and keys in the identification numbers.
The computer does the rest.
Winn-Dixie estimates that 30 percent of a store's customers will
use the lanes, but it won't give out a customer total. Generally,
customers with 10 items or less will try it, executives said.
The system, made by Productivity Solutions of Jacksonville, has
at least one other safeguard against theft. The bar code scanner
turns off after each item is recorded and doesn't switch on again
until the item rolls through the laser scanner. Also, there still
are cashiers and baggers who will watch for shoplifters, as they do
now.
The Automotive Service Association, or ASA, is a national
organization with members throughout the country and is a good
place to start. The organization has a code of ethics members are
expected to follow, and it offers benefits such as technical
training and other amenities to attract top-notch mechanics. It
performs a pre-employment check of prospective employees, which
helps weed out substandard mechanics, and encourages certification
of its members.
