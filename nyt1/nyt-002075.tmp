SAN FRANCISCO Some habits are hard to break. From the late
1960s to the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead were on the road almost
every year, playing down-home improvisational rock for twirling,
tie-dyed Dead Heads.
Three years after the death of Jerry Garcia, his fellow members
of the Grateful Dead are back together as the core of a new band,
the Other Ones, that sets out to resurrect and extend the Dead's
legacy.
The band made a triumphant hometown debut in San Francisco on
Thursday night at the Warfield Theater for a sold-out house of
2,400 people who arrived with loyal but guarded expectations and
left the concert jubilant.
The Other Ones include Hart, Bob Weir on guitar and Phil Lesh on
bass, Dead members since the 1960s, and Bruce Hornsby on keyboards,
who toured with the Dead in the 1990s. Mark Karan and Steve Kimock
on guitars, Dave Ellis on saxophones and John Molo on drums
complete the new band. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann, the other surviving
founder of the Dead, has retired.
This summer, the new band is to headline the third Furthur
Festival, an annual package tour of Dead-related bands. It goes to
the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 29
and the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on June 30. Hart said
the Other Ones had made no plans beyond the summer.
For their debut, the Other Ones had two things that the Grateful
Dead did not: nearly a month of daily rehearsals (including a
change of guitarist in the last week) and a set list that was
chosen before the band appeared onstage. But like the Dead, the
Other Ones rely on the chemistry of the moment.
The Dead brought the security of American roots music country,
blues, Appalachian music, rhythm-and-blues, even touches of Latin
rhythm to psychedelic wanderings; they made good-timey excursions
out of songs haunted by death and uncertainty. The two sets by the
Other Ones became both a reminder of what the Dead accomplished and
a glimpse of new prospects.
In more than three hours of music, the Other Ones celebrated the
Dead with the Dead's own limber, open-ended curiosity, bolstered by
the kind of thorough practice and rejuvenated energy that the
latter-day Dead had lost.

BONN, Germany With rescue efforts virtually ended after
Germany's worst rail crash in more than 50 years, officials said
Friday that the death toll stood at 96. The accident was so
gruesome that most of the bodies were mutilated beyond
identification.
