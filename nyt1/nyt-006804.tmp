After all, when the nation's most prestigious investment bankers
decide that it's time to cash out while the getting is still good,
who's to doubt them? They are the pros from Dover, who have advised
scores of corporations across the globe on how and when to raise
mountains of dough in the public market.
What's more, a Korn/Ferry IPO would come on the heels of an
initial stock offering by one of its foremost executive-search
competitors, Heidrick Struggles of Chicago. Heidrick reportedly
plans to allow its partners to cash in some of their chips by
selling a minority stake to the public in the fall.
And who is likely to underwrite the Heidrick offering? Why
Goldman, of course. (Telephone calls to Heidrick executives were
not returned.)
To be sure, investors may have good reason to take stock in the
nation's largest executive-search firm. The 29-year-old company
racked up $313 million in revenues in the fiscal year ended April
30. It boasts a client list of 3,000 companies that are served by
70 offices worldwide, and the firm employs more than 1,300 people.
Yup. Internet. The magic word in the investment world. And we're
not talking some kind of would-be Zapata here. Korn/ Ferry has
teamed with Dow Jones' Wall Street Journal to form Futurestep, an
Internet-based executive-search service geared toward mid-sized
companies.
In fact, much of the incentive for a public offering is being
driven by Korn/Ferry's desire to raise money to fund Futurestep.
Korn/ Ferry has a majority stake in the startup, which is
headquartered in the L.A. suburb of Sherman Oaks.
Dow Jones isn't pumping any of its own capital into the venture
and doesn't have an equity stake. But its partnership with Korn/
Ferry allows Wall Street Journal advertisers exclusive access to
various Futurestep services, such as job-candidate screening and
responding to job applicants. In turn, Korn/Ferry gets access to
the Journal's hefty classified-ad base.
Question is, will Web-obsessed investors still be lured by the
Internet sizzle if the IPO market starts to chill?
On the day that search engine also-ran Infoseek sold a hefty
stake to the Mouse (Walt Disney), leading search engine Yahoo
reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it plans to
take a $45 million charge during the second quarter.
Hats off to Bebe chief executive Manny Moushouf. After being
priced at $11 a share, his company's newly minted public shares
closed their first day of trading Wednesday at more than $13. And
the Brisbane clothing retailer kept its momentum yesterday, inching
up another 31 cents a share amid tepid waters for new offerings.
