Q: With so many great moments in Dodgers history, was there ever
a moment when it was nearly impossible for you to remain an
unbiased announcer and not a fan who just wanted to stand up and
cheer and show emotion?
A: I'll put it to you this way. In 1955, I was doing the last
half of the last game when the Dodgers won the World Series. And it
was the only one the Brooklyn Dodgers would win. And they had gone
through a great amount of frustration over the years.
So at the very end, on the last out, the ground ball to short,
the throw to first, I said, very simply, `Ladies and gentlemen, the
Brooklyn Dodgers are the champions of the world.' And all that
winter, people asked me, `How could you have been so calm?' And the
answer was that I wasn't calm at all. But if I had tried to say
another word, I would have broken down and cried, it was so
emotional.
Another time certainly would be Kirk Gibson's home run (in the
1988 World Series). The fact that it was such a theatrical home
run. He wasn't on the bench, then he limped out onto the field. A
fellow on one leg swinging really feebly several times. And then to
hit a game-winning World Series home run, that was pretty dramatic.
But along the way there have been so many. The three perfect
games, the 20 no-hitters that I've seen. All of those were great
moments. But there are only one or two where I had to hold myself
in check, and certainly, the Brooklyn Dodgers' world championship
and the Kirk Gibson home run would be high on the list.
Q: What has been the most difficult part of your job? Is it the
travel, the time away from family?
A: Exactly. I think when I'm doing the game, I'm happy, I'm
busy, I'm distracted from anything else because I'm totally
immersed in the game. But you know that's only three or four hours
of a 24-hour day.
The 24-hour day at home is fine. You have plenty of things to
do, obligations, plus your own family. But on the road, those 19,
20 hours grow very heavy. And the older you get, the more you
realize No. 1, the most precious thing is time. And No. 2, when
you're on the road, as well-intentioned as you might be, you still
kill time. And that hurts.
Q: Will you know when it is time to retire, or will you ever
retire?
A: As of right now, no, I don't think I will. As long as my
health stays, and as long as I still get goosebumps on great plays,
as long as I anticipate a game, then I know all the juices are
still flowing.
