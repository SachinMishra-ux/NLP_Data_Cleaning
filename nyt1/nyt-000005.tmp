The commission's budget, which was seriously cut during the
economic recession in New York in the early 1990s, has ballooned
since, despite no growth in the number of events. In 1992, for
example, the commission spent $494,800 to regulate 31 boxing shows.
Last year it spent $841,000 to oversee 30.
A spokesman for the commission, Scott Trent, said most of the
spending increases were due to staff salaries being restored to
their former levels. But spending on supplies, materials, medical
testing, travel and equipment purchases grew as well, according to
commission budget documents.
Most noticeably, the question of just how serious an operation
the commission is was underscored with the appointment of Floyd
Patterson as chairman in 1995. The two-time heavyweight world
champion, who is 63, has memory problems. He resigned in March, but
had long been regarded within the sport as a $76,000-a-year
figurehead.
New York places more demands on fighters and promoters than most
states do, in both medical tests and fees. The state requires each
fighter to get a CAT brain scan, as well as an electrocardiogram
and an EKG once a year. It also collects a 5.5 percent tax on
tickets and a .55 percent tax on television rights. And boxers
generally have to be in the state for several days before their
fights.
But even promoters who have been critical of New York say that
putting the state in a national context is crucial.
NEW YORK As refugees from Vietnam and Cambodia began trickling
into the Bronx about 15 years ago, their minds and bodies scarred
by war, Montefiore Medical Center, a private hospital with a long
history of serving immigrant and indigent New Yorkers, established
a clinic to serve them.
The federally subsidized clinic in East Fordham employed
full-time interpreters speaking Vietnamese and Khmer, the Cambodian
language. The interpreters scheduled the refugees' appointments,
helped them communicate with doctors and stood by them through Pap
smears, X-rays, MRIs and other unfamiliar rituals of Western
medicine.
But in April, because of financial pressures, the hospital
reassigned its two full-time interpreters to clerical jobs. It now
relies on eight employees fluent in Khmer or Vietnamese who work in
other jobs at the clinic from filing medical records to serving
as medical assistants to translate as needed.
The change has unleashed a flurry of protest by advocacy groups
and prompted an investigation by federal civil rights officials
into whether refugee patients are being denied ready access to
interpreters something Montefiore must provide as a condition of
receiving federal aid.
Larry Velez, a spokesman for the office of civil rights at the
federal Department of Health and Human Services, said his office's
inquiry, which began after clinic staff members and patients filed
a complaint, was the first in recent memory examining the civil
rights of non-English-speaking patients at a New York City
hospital.
