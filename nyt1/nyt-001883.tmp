With their outboard engine laboring at full throttle against the
flow, the men in the boat hardly could be seen to move.
Then the sun lay like a fat apricot atop the trees. A little
breeze came up and blew the heat away. The air between the hills
softened to blue.
And we turned back in twilight, trying to remember the way we'd
come, filled up with the summer adventure of having done almost
nothing at all.
George Tiller, a Wichita abortion provider, and his Women's
Health Care Services filed the lawsuit. Tiller wants the new law,
which becomes effective July 1, to be put on hold to give the
justices time to decide its fate.
Those on both sides of the abortion issue have raised questions
about the wording of the hastily written bill.
Gov. Bill Graves signed the measure but later said it might take
a court challenge to clarify it.
Graves, who ran for office four years ago as a supporter of
existing law, drew fire from abortion-rights activists after he
signed the bill into law.
Dave Gittrich, a spokesman for Kansans for Life, said the
organization would file briefs in support of the law.
Tiller, in urging the court to hear the case, said it should
take the action now because if the case is filed in a lower court,
appeals eventually will bring it before the justices anyway.
The court is expected to decide before the end of the month
whether to hear the case, dismiss it or send it to a district
court.
