The police said there had been only one arrest, that of a worker
accused of spraying the police with a substance similar to Mace,
and two incidents of sabotage that left some San Juan neighborhoods
without telephone service. While customers found it hard on
Thursday to get directory assistance and operator service, company
officials said regular phone service was virtually normal
throughout the island of nearly 4 million residents.
The partial sale of the telephone company is part of a
privatization program initiated by Gov. Pedro Rossells. In an
interview on Thursday, he said that telecommunications legislation
enacted by Congress in 1996 mandated an end to the telephone
monopoly here and that he envisioned more efficiency, better
service and lower rates after the company passed to private
control.
Union leaders, however, have criticized the deal struck with GTE
as too favorable for the buyer, and political opponents have
accused the governor of selling the company short in order to
finance some of his electoral promises.
Under the terms of the agreement, the government of Puerto Rico
would receive $1.8 billion for the majority share of the company,
of which a consortium that includes GTE, Banco Popular of Puerto
Rico and other local investors would pay $375 million, a cash
figure critics find too low. The other $1.5 billion would come from
a commercial loan taken by the privatized telephone company.
The government of Puerto Rico would retain at least 44 percent
ownership after contributing a 3 percent interest to an employee
stock ownership plan and offering to sell an additional 3 percent
interest to employees for that plan.
The money from the sale would go to pay off the telephone
company's current debt, finance certain retirement and health-care
benefits for company employees and establish a $1 billion fund to
invest in public works like sewage systems and water distribution
systems.
NEW YORK From his hospital bed, the squeegee man who police
say was shot by an off-duty officer in the Bronx on Sunday said in
an interview that the officer flew into a rage and shot him in the
chest at point-blank range even after he offered to remove the soap
he had poured onto the windshield of the officer's car.
The shooting has raised new questions about whether the Police
Department does enough to control officers with a history of
brutality complaints.
The man who was shot, Antoine Reid, 38, is in the intensive care
unit at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, where he is listed in
critical but stable condition. He said the incident began as he was
washing windshields at his usual spot on an exit of the Major
Deegan Expressway. As he soaped up the window of one car, he said,
the driver identified by the police as Michael W. Meyer, an
off-duty police officer cursed him, got out of his car, grabbed
him and then shot him without provocation.
Much of Reid's account of the shooting was similar to the
statements that detectives took from several witnesses, according
to three law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. But Meyer and his girlfriend, who was with him at the
time, have yet to provide their accounts and Reid had not yet been
interviewed by police Thursday last night. The officer has been
charged with attempted murder and is free on bail.
