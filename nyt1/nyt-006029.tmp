You'll also get the sometimes-depressing news here of how many
calories you're burning while engaged in various exercise
activities. That's because there's a high-tech calculator that lets
you enter the information about your exercise program and get a
fairly accurate indication of the calories you burn.
You probably know all about personal trainers. That's the rage
now at the gym. These folks help you set up an exercise plan and
health goals based on your age, weight, physical condition and
personal goals. Well, now it's time for you to meet a virtual
personal trainer that can do almost the same thing. Just head for a
site called The Fitness Zone: Fitness Profile at http://www
You'll fill out the on-screen form with the same kind of
information you'd give a real-world personal trainer and, in just
seconds, get an exercise profile and an assessment of your current
fitness level. You'll need to know your blood pressure to fill out
the form, but you should know that anyway, since a visit to your
physician is strongly recommended before starting any new exercise
plan.
Since -- right or wrong -- most of us associate a fitness plan
with losing weight, you'll want to stop by a site called Shape Up
America at http://www.shapeup
Finally, to get started on your fitness program, perform this
low-stress exercise. Reach out with your right finger, turn off
your computer and take a walk.
This Windows computer is not much bigger than a computer
magazine. The bright, sharp, 10.4-inch active-matrix screen shares
the 800 by 600 pixel resolution of the IBM 560 line, but its
smaller size gives it a better chance of being useful in coach
class seats.
The price for all this miniaturization is a surprisingly low
$2,000, but a slightly fancier model, the VAIO 505GX, is scheduled
to be introduced June 23 at the PC Expo show at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center. It increases the processor speed to 266
megahertz and adds a fast IEEE 1394 port that few users will ever
need. Those enhancements do not seem worth the extra $700 Sony will
exact for them.
Both machines will officially be available July 24. The review
units I tried came with Windows 98 preinstalled, but lacked manuals
and the very last of their software tweaks and had some problems
suspending themselves and awakening where they left off.
Nonetheless, they came as close to being portable dream machines as
any I have ever used.
The big question mark with a little machine is its keyboard. At
just under 90 percent of normal width, this one is serviceable but
not without annoyances. The right shift key is undersized, the top
row keys, including delete, are downright tiny, and the layout
takes getting used to. While you master it, you will probably be
glad for the oversized backspace key. Though the palm rest is
comfortable and helps counteract the screen's tendency to tilt the
unit backward when you use it in your lap, the keyboard lacks the
silken feel of IBM 560s.
I strongly prefer pointing sticks to the touchpads that Sony
favors, but I was able to adjust this one to be a bit less twitchy
than some I have tried. On one unit the left button was excessively
stiff and unresponsive, so I did my clicking by tapping my finger
on the pad. A compartment at the edge of the screen holds a stylus;
in collaboration with a program called Scribblepad, it lets you
write or draw on the touchpad and see the results on the screen.
That might be a lifesaver if you need to sign a digital document
digitally, but I found it tricky to use. An unlimited undo feature
helps.
