The festival's budget was $139,000 that first season; in recent
years, it has hovered around $5 million. Today, the directorial
reins are held by a triumvirate Charles MacKay, general director;
Colin Graham, artistic director, and Stephen Lord, music director but the original vision has remained largely intact.
John Going, the stage director, had some innocent fun with the
work, moving it from Italy to Buenos Aires but keeping it in the
mid-19th century. If there is no reason for the move, there is also
nothing objectionable about it, and Phyllis Mead took the new
location into account in her amusing and often freewheeling
translation. The set, by James Wolk, offers a panoramic view of
Buenos Aires harbor as a backdrop, with walls, gates and palm trees
defining Don Pasquale's estate. Liz Covey's costumes ornate for
the gentry, motley for the household staff completed the picture.
What makes this production a joy is an ensemble that is vocally
secure and adept at comic timing and interaction.
Mary Dunleavy negotiated the high-flying arias that Donizetti
created for Norina with technical ease and interpretive subtlety.
She also moved comfortably between the two characterizations
demanded of her: that of the graceful young lover and the demanding
shrew. Gregory Turay, a tenor with an attractive timbre and plenty
of power, sang Ernesto's music sensitively. Timothy Nolen played
the title role with a broader range of emotions than is typical,
and Jeff Mattsey was a suitably conspiratorial Dr. Malatesta.
These emotionally bleak stories inspired extraordinary music
from both Janacek and Gounod. When Katya is at her most conflicted,
the music conveys a great deal more about her turmoil and passion
than the libretto (heard in a translation by Norman Tucker). Gounod
achieved a similar effect in a more constricted harmonic language.
Marie Plette sang Katya's music with the intensity and dimension
it demands, and was closely matched in both vocal power and
purposefulness by Robert Brubaker, as Boris, and Sari Gruber, as
Tichon's sympathetic sister Varvara. Michael Hayes as Tichon and
Kathryn Day as Kabanicha provided the necessary texture and
familial counterpoint.
Mary Mills conveyed Marguerite's youthfulness and faith
compellingly, and sang with a touching warmth and beauty. As Faust,
John Fowler was vocally strained, particularly at the top of his
range, and dramatically overwrought, but that made him a good foil
for David Pittsinger's spectacularly agile portrayal of
Mephistopheles.
The cast also included Franco Pomponi, as the hot-headed
Valentin, and Valerie Komar, who sang nicely but tended to overact,
as Siebel, Marguerite's hapless suitor.
Training camp is less than three months away, but the Bruins
were forced to slap an early question mark over their net Thursday
when their No. 1 goaltender, Byron Dafoe, underwent surgery to
repair a slightly torn shoulder capsule.
According to club president/general manager Harry Sinden, the
27-year-old Dafoe was experiencing pain and soreness in recent
weeks while lifting weights at his offseason home in Los Angeles.
