YANKS-LEDE Two of the most eccentric owners in baseball will
go at each other again, when Ted Turner's Braves and George
steinbrenner's Yankees meet this week during a 4-game series.
Baseball people talk about both owners, their highs/lows and what
they have meant to the game. (Rosenberg, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
YANKS-COLUMN All baseball eyes turn to series between Braves
and Yankees this week because it's about the best baseball has to
offer until playoffs. (Hummer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

NEW YORK Down a cascade of steel steps in the half-basement
Chinese video store in Elmhurst, Queens, Shi Jiehua methodically
glued labels onto black plastic cases one recent afternoon as a
Chinese soap opera murmured on a small television.
This shoe box of a store has become a gathering place for some
of the greatest Chinese opera stars part of a growing diaspora of
opera performers who have come to the United States from China,
often initially to perform, but then to stay.
They come seeking freedom for themselves and opportunity for
their children. But unlike many artists from Western countries
whose celebrity follows them here, the performers from China find
themselves plunged into the austere world of new Chinese
immigrants, a world of menial jobs, Spartan housing and little
contact beyond the immigrant community.
For many Chinese, the sight of Shi Jiehua shelving videotapes or
Cai Qingling delivering takeout food is akin to the notion of
Luciano Pavarotti scrubbing pots at a pasta joint in Little Italy.
But virtually no Chinese opera star in this country can survive on
performing and teaching alone.
Still, in the last 10 years, a network of opera societies,
workshops and private patrons has evolved in cities across the
United States, especially in New York. Amateur opera buffs can
study with master teachers. Legendary singers from Shanghai, here
at the invitation of local Chinese arts centers, spend afternoons
mingling with opera greats who have immigrated. One group scours
China for talented performers, trying to lure them to live in the
United States.
Some wealthy Chinese here, evoking the practice in the late Ming
Dynasty of having individual opera troupes attached to great
households, even sponsor stars from China to come and sing for them
and their friends in intimate gatherings.
Year after year, opera stars from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
and dozens of other cities across China filter into the United
States, some through performing-artist visas, others through
defecting from visiting opera companies. So great is the influx of
talent that, unlike anywhere in China, New York regularly has
performances of China's four major opera traditions by stars of the
first magnitude.
