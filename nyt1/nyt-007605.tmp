Mandel has a built-in following from his days as stand-up comic
and actor, but the big question remains: Can a former rubber
glovehead ever be taken seriously as a daytime talk show host?
MONTREAL Despite their denials, surely they want to be a part
of it: New York, New York, then Atlanta, Atlanta. How else to
explain how listless the Braves were for most of the weekend?
Surely, they overlooked the Expos in anticipation of tonight's
Yankee biggie in the Bronx.
On Friday, facing a reclamation project named Shawn Boskie,
Atlanta was humbled 14-1, its worst loss in four years. On Sunday,
after the encouraging Saturday night return of John Smoltz, the
Braves stumbled against another right-hander with no prior success
against Atlanta. Dustin Hermanson allowed just five hits in eight
innings and, save for Michael Tucker's solo homer, frustrated
Atlanta in Montreal's 4-1 victory.
That denied the Braves a 15th straight series win over Montreal,
which hadn't taken a series from Atlanta since 1994. It also gave
Expos manager Felipe Alou his 500th career victory, who savored it
even more coming against Bobby Cox.
Neagle's now lost as many games as he did all last season when,
at 20-5, he was the NL's lone 20-game winner. The sixth-inning,
leadoff homer by Shane Andrews was the 16th surrendered by Neagle
(seventh in his last four starts), just two fewer than he allowed
last year.
But the third inning was decisive, when the Expos batted around
and scored three times. This after Neagle had retired the first
nine batters in order.
What with baby-boomers of the female persuasion wringing their
hands, furrowing their brows and working themselves up into
frenzies over the passing years and the ebb of hormones, thank
goodness Cybill Shepherd is offering advice.
