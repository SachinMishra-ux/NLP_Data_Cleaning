MONTREAL John Smoltz's return to action went perfectly and
precisely to the pitch Saturday night. Working seven strong and
pain-free innings, Smoltz gave up just an unearned run and struck
out a season-high eight as the Braves beat Montreal 5-1.
In his first start since lasting just two innings May 23 and
then going on the disabled list for the second time this season,
Smoltz displayed no pain in his pitching elbow and little for the
Expos to hit. He was much sharper than in his two minor-league
rehab assignments and got a first-inning, three-run homer from Javy
Lopez. Working on a 90-pitch limit, Smoltz (5-1) left after giving
up just four hits and registering his last strikeout on his 90th
pitch.
Lopez quickly complied. After Walt Weiss led off the night with
the first of his three straight singles and Chipper Jones singled
Weiss to second, both players advanced when Carlos Perez stumbled
in his delivery, fell off the mound and dropped the ball for a
balk. On the next pitch, Lopez crushed a two-out, three-run homer.
It was Lopez's 16th home run, a figure he didn't reach last
season until July 26th. It was also his fourth homer against the
Expos, third in eight days. And it gave him 52 RBIs, just 17 shy of
his career season high.
It also gave Smoltz an early three-run security blanket. Not
that he needed it. After the second Expo batter, Jose Vidro, lined
an opposite-field double on a good down-and-away breaking ball,
Smoltz retired the next 11 hitters. At one point, he struck out six
of eight, fanning the side swinging in the third inning.
When Montreal finally broke through in the fifth, it was an
unearned run. After Chipper Jones' booted Rondell White's leadoff
grounder for a two-base error, White took third on a flyout, then
scored on Chris Widger's sacrifice fly. But that merely cut it to
5-1.
Gerald Williams, again capitalizing on another rare start,
followed Weiss' leadoff single in the fifth with the second of his
three singles. Chipper Jones, scratched from Friday's embarrassing
14-1 loss with the flu, then doubled both Braves home.
His new left-handed rifle. A shooter depends on his eye the way
a kicker does his leg. But the freak accident forced Shank to
switch the eye he uses to sight the target and, by extension, shoot
from the left side of his body.
After a 10-month layoff, Shank returned to the sport a year ago
and placed fourth at the Junior Olympics three months ago.
Just as he had to switch from right to left, Shank also
transferred his longtime wish of attending West Point to the
reality of entering the Naval Academy, which recruited him for its
rifle team.
