The first operation was in early 1991 at the outbreak of the
Persian Gulf War. The second came in September 1995, following a
series of bombings and a bloody attack on a Jewish school in
southern France.
Perhaps nothing better illustrates security concerns regarding
the upcoming worldwide soccer extravaganza than the lengths to
which French and neighboring European leaders are going in an
attempt to avoid disaster.
Last month, the Vigipirate took part in synchronized pre-dawn
raids at 10 locations across France, arresting 88 suspected
terrorists, said to represent the Algerian Armed Islamic Group, who
officials believe were targeting the World Cup.
Traditionally, it is the ultimate quadrennial championship of
the world's favorite game, a five-week showcase of spectacular
athleticism, color and culture.
The 1998 World Cup, which is expected to draw nearly 2.5 million
people to France and attract a cumulative television audience of
more than 30 billion, begins Tuesday and concludes with the
championship game July 12 in Saint Denis, a quaint city just north
of Paris.
There will be 64 matches in 10 French cities involving 32
nations, 10,000 members of the media, every form of mass transport,
countless open-air parties and hundreds of organized events for
fans. Numerous world figures will attend, from heads of state to
international royalty to television and movie personalities.
Thus, concern about potential security problems for the World
Cup goes far beyond the typical drunkenness and soccer hooliganism.
World Cup organizers are bracing for the unknown up to and
including terrorism.
Four years ago, when the World Cup was held in the United
States, simple geography aided security forces. It was difficult
for much of the world to arrive in the United States by anything
but airplane. Since airport security forces easily dispatched or
arrested known thugs or terrorist sympathizers as they tried to
enter the country, problems were held to a minimum.
But in France, the estimated 2.5 million people expected to
watch the event will be arriving en masse from every direction,
using planes, ships, trains and automobiles.
Each national team participating in the tournament will be
protected by the elite French RAID police. Many teams, including
the U.S. team, will bring their own security personnel.
