He allegedly lied to officials at those sites to obtain access
and later to investigators in the case.
WASHINGTON President Clinton on Thursday named United Nations
Ambassador Bill Richardson as his choice for energy secretary and
tapped veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke for the U.N. post.
Flanked by his foreign policy team in the Rose Garden, the
president also called on Congress to pass legislation paying the
more than $1 billion the United States owes the United Nations in
back dues. The bill is stalled because conservatives insist on
including anti-abortion language in the measure.
Richardson, 50, a former New Mexico congressman who gained a
reputation as an international trouble-shooter prior to being the
U.N. ambassador, will become the highest ranking Hispanic in the
administration. He replaces Federico Pena who served as
transportation secretary and most recently as energy secretary.
Clinton continued to signal his emphasis on clean energy
alternatives as he emphasized the issue of climate change in
announcing Richardson's appointment.
Holbrooke, 57, brokered the 1995 Dayton Accord that brought a
restless peace to Bosnia after four years of civil war and most
recently worked on quieting the issue of Cyprus that has long
divided Greece and Turkey.
Holbrooke, his voice wavering, recalled his father taking him to
see the newly built U.N. buildings as an 8-year-old and telling him
they would become the most important in the world.
WASHINGTON As a congressman and later as the Clinton
administration's chief delegate to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson displayed a flair for missions that required a sense of
derring-do, like the time he persuaded officials in Pyongyang to
release an American who stole into North Korea to convert all its
citizens to Christianity.
Richardson's model as free-form diplomatic troubleshooter has
been as much Indiana Jones as Henry Kissinger as he has traveled to
odd and sometimes fearsome parts of the world, including Sudan,
Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and Myanmar, in addition to
North Korea. On many of those missions he has often been successful
in winning the release of hostages from governments and warlords
when traditional diplomacy had failed to do so.
In choosing Richardson to be his new energy secretary, President
Clinton has given him an assignment which traditionally carries far
less glamour and less opportunity for a high public profile. But no
one in the capital expects Richardson to recede into relative
obscurity.
