In some cities, the shift toward private home-ownership had
already begun in the last few years. Some work units began selling
apartments to workers, and stopped allocating housing to new
employees. Another factor has been the gradual spread of private
companies and foreign joint ventures, which provide far fewer
social benefits like housing to their workers.
Then, last March, in his first statement as prime minister, Zhu
Rongji declared that the longstanding system of subsidized housing
would quickly be ended altogether.
City governments and work units began hashing out rules for the
transition, including purchase prices and restraints on resale and
rental.
This week, at a closed three-day conference of public officials,
national guidelines for the change were spelled out, but provinces
and local governments were given leeway in the timing and specific
rules, according to reports Thursday in the state-run press.
Among other things, the government is pushing banks to offer
home mortgages, a novel concept here. Rents, for those who do not
buy, will multiply by several times, but subsidies will still be
given to those with the lowest incomes.
In general, purchase prices are being set at what might appear
to be bargain levels $10,000 may be typical for a two-bedroom
apartment in Beijing with deductions according to length of
service in state agencies or companies, and the age of the
dwelling.
But with many urban families earning only a few thousand dollars
a year, if that, the prices are still a strain and since March,
housing questions have preoccupied many.
Most people seem enthusiastic about the idea of home ownership,
and many have been scrambling to pull together down payments of
perhaps 30 percent.
But the relative financial merits of the offered choices have
often seemed confusing, and people are rightly worried about future
maintenance costs in poorly constructed buildings. In Beijing, an
initial deadline of July 1 for commitments to purchase at
subsidized prices had to be postponed until the end of the year.
Rao Jianhong, 32, and his wife, Li Juan, 31, both assistant
professors at Beijing Business College and parents of a 4-year-old
girl, said they were delighted to have the chance to buy their
two-bedroom apartment for just over $10,000. With their extra
income from teaching night classes, Rao said, they would just be
able to make their mortgage payments of $120 a month.
