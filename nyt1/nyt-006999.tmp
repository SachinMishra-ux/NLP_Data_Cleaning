A. The only substantial red flag I can see is that by spending
the lion's share of the educational savings on a private high
school, you will have relatively little accumulated for them by the
time they're ready for college. If you were to continue at your
$100 a month pace for each, but this time putting it in your own
name and paying any taxes the accounts accrued, you might have
$9,126 for the older child by the time of his or her freshman year,
and $11,099 for the younger at the same period. These projections
are based on an assumption of average annual returns of 8 percent,
and that might be optimistic since you correctly anticipate moving
these investments to more cautious vehicles as the time you will
require the funds draws closer.
So the first question is whether you can afford this course,
which entails either saving more now for the college years, coming
up with funds for college from other sources, or leaving the kids
largely to their wits when it comes college time -- i.e. hoping for
scholarships and grants to carry the bulk of the load. But just as
a point of reference, if you kept the current college savings pool
working until their freshman years, with the ongoing $100 monthly
contributions and average returns of 8 percent, the elder child
would have $39,279 at the beginning of the freshman year, and the
account for the younger would be $43,661.
Whatever you decide, it would indeed be wise to switch the
further savings into your own name. And if you go with the plan for
private secondary education, I agree that the portfolios would be
fairly sharply realigned. All three of your funds concentrate on
large- cap stocks (although Vanguard Asset Allocation has 40
percent of its portfolio in long-term bonds). If the funds are to
be used in the next six years, I'd suggest something like this:
retain 25 percent in Vanguard Asset Allocation and then divide the
balance between Vanguard High-Yield Corporate and Vanguard
Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury funds.
Although the current $19,000 balances are probably more than
double the amount of your cash contributions, remember taxes have
been paid on distributions each year as the accounts grew, and the
amount of those reinvested distributions increases your base cost.
Whatever the tax bill comes out to, it's probably prudent to pay
it now and reduce the risk.
If you decide against a private high school, I would still
reduce the portfolio's risk, but not as dramatically -- probably
retaining the Asset Allocation position as is and move about half
the money in the all-stock funds into a high-yield bond fund.
Q. I graduated from college a year ago and will be 23 at the end
of next month. I want to get an early start on retirement planning.
I am involved in a family real estate development business and have
a good earning potential. I plan to set up a Keough plan next year.
If I were to put $10,000 or $15,000 into this plan every year, what
kind of a nest egg would I be looking at when I am both 43 and 53
years old? My thought is to go strictly with growth funds because
of my age. What strategy would you advise if I am able to save this
much cash?
A. A 20-year investment program with contributions of $833 a
month (or $10,000 a year) would grow to $589,942, assuming 10
percent average annual contributions; bump the monthly
contributions up to $1,250, or $15,000 a year, and the sum would be
$898,417.
But it's in the next decade that the cash really begins to pile
up, taking the kitty to $1,720,378 with the lower level of
contributions, and to $2,570,578 at the $15,000 annual level.
I agree that growth funds are the ticket for a fellow your age,
but you'll want to spread your bets among various sectors of the
market. In my example, I'll cite Fidelity funds, but you could
build a similar portfolio with most other major fund families.
