It was just another moment in the odyssey of campaign finance
overhaul, an issue that has unexpectedly refused to die this year
despite the concerted efforts of Republican leaders in both houses
to block any changes that would erode their party's fund-raising
advantage.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to dispense with the matter in
March under rules that never allowed the main, bipartisan overhaul
bill to the floor. But the speaker's tactic boomeranged
politically, giving the overhaul effort new momentum.
Next he promised that the issue would come up in May.
Technically it did for several hours of debate and with no votes.
Since then, the House has been meandering through a thicket of
campaign finance proposals, usually at night.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., attributed the demise of
anti-smoking legislation in the Senate to the tobacco industry's
campaign contributions to the Republican Party.
She went on to quote from a Wall Street Journal article about
Rep. Linda Smith, R-Wash., who is running for the Senate. In that
article, Ms. Smith, first elected to the House in 1994, said she
had quickly discovered that it was common practice for Republican
leaders to hold up action on bills while seeking more donations
from interested contributors.
Probable starting pitchers: Tonight RHP Kevin Millwood (9-2,
3.73 ERA; 1-0, 1.00 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Shawn Boskie (0-0,
0.00; 1-4, 4.50 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday RHP John Smoltz
(4-1, 3.94; 10-6. 2.56 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. LHP Carlos Perez
(6-5, 3.64; 2-3, 2.98 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday LHP Denny
Neagle (8-4, 3.18; 5-6, 3.96 lifetime vs. Expos) vs. RHP Dustin
Hermanson (4-6, 3.20; 0-2, 5.40 lifetime vs. Braves).Past meetings:
The Braves have taken 2-of-3 from the Expos twice this season at
Turner Field.
Quickly: Tuesday, the Expos optioned right-hander Mike Johnson
to Ottawa and called up veteran Shawn Boskie, who spent last season
with the Cubs, Phillies and Mariners. Johnson was pounded in
Atlanta in his last outing Saturday, giving up eight hits and seven
earned runs in just three innings. . . . The Expos are the
weakest-hitting team in the majors, with a .243 average and just
221 RBIs. Only Cincinnati fields worse than Montreal, which has a
.975 fielding percentage and 67 errors.
Who's hot: Guerrero leads the club in batting, runs and hits. In
his last 14 games, he's batting .345 (20-for-58) with six doubles,
three homers and 11 RBIs.
Who's not: Rookie Vazquez (1-6, 6.00) had lost his last four
decisions and had not won in eight starts (four no-decisions) since
May 1 entering Thursday night's start against the Mets.
Didn't make any difference Thursday at The Ted. Klesko's bat
remains ablaze, but a fourth-inning base-running error, which he
later second-guessed, played a part in the Braves' 3-2 loss to the
Florida Marlins.
