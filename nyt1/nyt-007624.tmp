The attack, like most along the border, was apparently intended
to depopulate the border villages and to form an empty buffer zone
to thwart the smuggling of weapons and fighters from Albania.
Serb helicopters, while never firing directly on the frightened
groups of villagers taking shelter in the trees, hovered overhead
after the attacks and let off machine gun bursts near the clusters
of people, those in Junik said.
With most of its houses damaged and its streets empty save for
improvised log barricades and debris from the shelling, Junik looks
desolate and still. Men with assault rifles flit in and out of the
shadows, appearing in doorways of broken homes and then backing
away into the gloomy interiors. A handful of elderly people who
could not make the 15-hour trek over the mountains and two Yugoslav
army deserters from Montenegro the other remaining republic in
Yugoslavia live with the outgunned band in this beleaguered
redoubt.
The Serb snipers, to keep those bottled up in the town on edge,
fire off a few rounds a day. There is desultory mortar fire. The
fields are untended because the farmers fear being exposed to the
snipers. Electricity and phone service have been cut, and food is
growing scarce.
The noose is being tightened around the town. Serb troops mined
the routes leading from Junik into Albania a week ago, the
villagers said. They said that the troops have looted and burned
five neighboring villages Molic, Brovina, Ponosevac, Popovac and
Morina in the past few days.
Those in the village appeared not fully aware of the weight of
the Serb firepower that awaited them up the road. They vowed they
would not flee. When asked if they were members of the guerrilla
movement they were hesitant and unsure.
Billows of black smoke spiraled into a crystal blue sky from a
lumberyard that had been set alight not far from the Serb
positions. A Serb helicopter flew toward Junik and then turned in a
wide arc toward the border, the thumping of its blades gradually
fading away.
When asked what his wife said before she left for Albania he
lowered his eyes.
And he has a Web site dedicated to the 16-year-old Russian
beauty to prove it.
