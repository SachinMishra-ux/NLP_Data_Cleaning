But according to several sources, O'Malley's personal
relationship with Nomo helped shape the deal. O'Malley stressed
Thursday in a private meeting with Japanese media the importance of
his friendship with Nomo, who O'Malley helped sign in 1995.
Claire spent most of Thursday negotiating with four clubs
including Baltimore, Cleveland and Texas. The Angels, who had
expressed an interest in Nomo, were asked about closer Troy
Percival but said no.
Nomo, the 1995 National League Rookie of the Year, is looking to
get his career back on track after dropping to 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA
at the time he was designated. He is in the final season of a
three-year contract that is paying $2.8 million.
Nomo became frustrated when the Dodgers did not offer a contract
extension this winter. Last fall, he underwent surgery to remove
bone chips from his right elbow. He also had personality clashes
with Dodgers manager Bill Russell, but the lack of a contract
beyond this season was the leading reason for his unhappiness.
Claire was very close to completing a deal with Baltimore on
Wednesday, but O'Malley intervened after Nomo indicated he did not
want to play for the Orioles.
Mlicki, who will join the Dodgers this weekend in Seattle, is
making $1.25 million in the first of a two-year contract.
McMichael, who will join the Dodgers on Monday when they open a
three-game series against Oakland, is guaranteed $1.8 million this
season with a $1.95 million option for next season. The option
becomes guaranteed if he pitches in at least 31 more games this
season.
The Dodgers were hoping to get left-handed reliever Brian
Bohanon, who is earning $350,000 this year. But his 2-2 record and
2.30 ERA and the ability to start and relieve made him too valuable
to the Mets.
