SAN FRANCISCO The Treasure Island School has 460 kids in
kindergarten through seventh grade, with an eighth grade and 140
more kids to come next year. All students are bused from San
Francisco's Tenderloin, Chinatown and Mission neighborhoods.
I just adopted this school. It's on an island paradise, except
it's called Willigan's Island (as in Mayor Willie Brown, who has
kept the island off-limits to the general public). That means these
kids need help. It's either me or Quentin Kopp.
You see, the kids are fenced in on an acre of asphalt a
softball's throw from palms and playing fields. But they can't play
there without clearance from the island administration.
They plant little gardens in boxes inside the fence, keep tabs
on the robin in its nest, and the kindergartners play in a patch of
weeds they find glorious.
The only playground equipment on the school's asphalt is a
volleyball net and some balls bought by teachers, and hula hoops
donated by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, which also has
adopted the school.
A few feet beyond the fence are slides and jungle gyms in the
unused former Navy housing area on Treasure Island, a former naval
base.
This is the kind of equipment the school needs, but needs help
getting from the island bureaucracy. The principal still hasn't
gotten a response from her request last August for a piece of
playground equipment she wanted.
I love being an adoptive columnist. Unfortunately, the school
also needs a $10,000 mat to put on the asphalt under the playground
equipment.
Lord knows where the money for that mat comes from, when
teachers choked on the $70 insurance fee Conroy's office was going
to charge for two class picnics on an island field Wednesday.
