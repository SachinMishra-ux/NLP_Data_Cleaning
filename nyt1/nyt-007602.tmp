When Bebel Gilberto, his daughter, joined him for a final
encore, she showed how radical Gilberto's reticence had been. She
made phrases crest and subside; she made eye contact with the
audience. But after her father's solo performance, she seemed to be
trying too hard, creating a diversion from his unwavering purity.
ST. LOUIS, Mo. Revisiting works of the past can be a thankless
job for a composer, because listeners tend to regard an earlier
composer's thought process as sacrosanct and a later composer's
additions as intrusive.
But Mahler's Bach orchestrations raise eyebrows, and earnest
completions of scores by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Mahler
have generated reams of critical debate (or, in some cases, yawns
of indifference).
Instead, Goehr retained the lament and built his own structure
around it. Strands of Monteverdian harmonic, melodic and ornamental
style, as well as references to his instrumental coloration, are
woven through a contemporary fabric of quirky rhythms, eerie and
exotic percussion textures, brash, expressive dissonance and vocal
lines that combine declamation and gorgeously arching melody.
In Rinuccini's libretto, a weak-willed Teseo vows to make
Arianna his queen, then abandons her on Naxos. She is disconsolate,
but Venus and Cupid have conspired to send Bacchus to Naxos, where
he falls in love with Arianna and marries her. In Ocel's staging,
this finale is too much for Arianna, whose lament for Teseo was
presented only moments earlier as a wrenching mad scene. She walks
through her courtship and wedding with glazed eyes and a skeptical
look. Goehr set the text in Italian; it is being presented here in
a deftly poetic English translation by Margaret B. Stearns.
Ocel, abetted by Leslie M. Taylor's spare set and Robin
VerHage-Abrams' polyglot costuming, parodies this tale of gods and
mortals in a brilliant parade of modern stereotypes.
Among the gods, a punkish Cupid wears red leather, reads a
supermarket tabloid and carries a switchblade instead of a bow and
arrow. Venus is a tipsy, aging bleached-blond courtesan and Jove is
a doddering antique. Bacchus, looking like a paunchy Kurt Cobain,
has a retinue of Blues Brothers imitators.
Among the mortals, Teseo and his soldiers wear American Army
uniforms, and Teseo's Councilor, who persuades him to leave
Arianna, is a slick lawyer with tortoise-shell glasses and a
leather briefcase. Arianna is dressed in a bridal gown; her
confidante, Dorilla, is a frumpy 1950s housewife. Except for their
odd masks, the fishermen who convey a lot of the information in
Rinuccini's talky libretto are presented straightforwardly.
Executing Ocel's notions and Goehr's music while keeping the
ghosts of Monteverdi and Rinuccini in listeners' minds is a lot to
ask, but the singers were clearly game.
Phyllis Pancella's Arianna hit the emotional extremes perfectly:
her powerful, beautifully sung account of the lament was the
production's most gripping moment, and her sudden acceptance of her
improved situation in the work's final seconds gave the piece a
surprising, comic twist. Marcel Reijans, once he got a wayward
vibrato under control, gave a solid account of Teseo's conflicted
music. James Wood was the suitably shadowy Councilor, and Mark
Crayton, a fine countertenor, was an amusingly dissolute Bacchus.
There were also strong contributions by Dorothy Byrne, as Venus and
Dorilla, Janice Creswell, as Cupid, and Kevin Short, Jeffrey Picon
and Thomas Trotter in smaller roles.
