Davis admitted that the Rainbows do a good job at picking up
after themselves but said the sheer size of the event means the
area will be damaged.
In the camp, there is at least one dog for every three people.
Last year in Oregon, the Rainbows left behind at least 100 dogs.
Those that were caught had to be destroyed because of a parvo
outbreak, Davis said.
Aside from the forest, is what happens to the small communities
they typically invade. The twin towns of Springerville and Eagar
are home to only about 5,000 combined, and Apache is the most
economically depressed county in the state.
Many Rainbows have money and are spending it in stores, but too
many are relying on a rapidly disappearing charity system. The
Rainbows have been arriving for less than a week and already the
welcome mats have been pulled in.
Police have written dozens of citations for panhandling,
shoplifting and vagrancy, and most businesses have closed their
public restrooms.
An incident Sunday also has led businesses to lock their
dumpsters. A small party of Rainbow women went into a convenience
store and bathed in the bathroom, which is in the pantry. While
there they also urinated on several cases of beer and food, police
said. The goods had to be thrown out, and when they were, the
Rainbows were waiting, according to Eagar police.
That is one of the many tactics Rainbows have used at past
gatherings to get stores to throw away food, Davis said. Another is
poking holes in the plastic wrap on meat. The Forest Service task
force has urged stores to lock trash bins so there is no reward for
this type of behavior.
Two Rainbows were hospitalized Monday after a car accident, and
there has been a growing stream of visitors in the local hospital
emergency room for cuts, broken bones and other care.
The small hospital in Pineville, Ore., where the Rainbows
gathered last year, is still owed $32,000 in medical bills. Dave
Ross, CEO for the White Mountain Communities Hospital, expects to
face the same problem.
With Rainbows arriving from practically every state, and few
carrying insurance, it will be up to the county's indigent
health-care fund to shoulder the burden when they get hurt.
