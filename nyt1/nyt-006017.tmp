More often they're used by the military to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling and most do they're
no longer functioning.
The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.
