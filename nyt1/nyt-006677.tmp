I head for the old blond dresser's mate across the room. I pull
out a top drawer and she starts sorting.

want to be baseball's fulltime commissioner. But don't be surprised
when he accepts it. By Larry Whiteside.
Lyondell Petrochemical Co. agreed Thursday to buy ARCO Chemical
Co. from the Atlantic Richfield Company for $5.6 billion in cash, a
deal that would triple Lyondell's size and make it a major provider
of chemicals used in everyday products such as plastics, detergents
and paints.
The agreement effectively reunites ARCO Chemical with Lyondell,
itself a former Atlantic Richfield subsidiary. Lyondell will pay
$57.75 a share for the outstanding shares of ARCO Chemical, which
is 82.2 percent owned by Atlantic Richfield.
The sale was not a surprise since Atlantic Richfield, a major
oil company based in Los Angeles, has been reducing its chemical
business as part of a broader strategy to focus on oil exploration
and production.
