New York University law professor Lester Brickman calculated
that without the fee cap, the tobacco legislation would have made
billionaires out of 10 lawyers and hundred-millionaires out of 50
more.
Previous efforts to limit legal fees, first to $250 an hour, and
then to $1,000 an hour, were roundly defeated. The highest-paid
lawyers in Washington charge roughly $500 an hour.
The roll-call vote was prolonged by last-minute arm-twisting,
and the fee cap passed only when Gordon Smith, R-Ore., changed his
vote to yes.
The $516 billion tobacco bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., would raise cigarette taxes by $1.10 a pack, regulate
tobacco marketing and set up a host of new programs covering
everything from illegal drugs to child care.
The bill would also settle 40 state claims against the tobacco
companies to recoup Medicaid costs for smoking-related illnesses.
State attorneys general had hired private attorneys to help them
with the litigation. The attorneys agreed to work on a
contingency-fee basis, as is common in large cases, but that was
before anyone knew the settlement would reach into the financial
stratosphere.
Some law firms were involved in several of the state suits,
standing to collect fees in each one. Six of the 12 law firms
involved in Florida's $11 billion settlement have been disputing a
deal that would provide $280 million in legal fees. The six firms
instead want $2.5 billion, or the 25 percent contingency fee
originally agreed on.
Trial lawyers are among the top donors to the Democratic Party
and one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington. They give less
money to Republicans because of the GOP's support for limits on
product liability, but nonetheless count many Republicans among
their key supporters.
Democrats argued that the attorney fee limits were a subterfuge
intended to kill the tobacco bill, which aims to reduce teen
smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes.
The original tobacco bill would pay tobacco farmers $28 billion
over 25 years if they relinquish their right to grow tobacco. It
would leave the quota system intact.
Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, who has led the drive to end
farm subsidies, pushed an alternative that would pay the farmers
$18 billion over three years and eliminate the quotas.
