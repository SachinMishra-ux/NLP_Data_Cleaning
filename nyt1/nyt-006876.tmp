He said editors discovered the fabrications earlier this month,
while Ms. Smith was on vacation, and confronted her when she
returned.
The Globe said Ms. Smith also acknowledged inventing Jim Burke,
a worker erecting barricades at the Boston Marathon, in her April
20 column; and Claire, for whom Ms. Smith did not give a last name,
the subject of a poignant column about a woman with cancer,
published on May 11.
Ms. Smith, who began her newspaper career as a typist at The
Chicago Daily News, joined The Globe in 1990. She has been writing
a column for the Metro/Region section since 1994. This year, she
won an award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors for a
series of columns published in 1997. She was also nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. A poet, she has been
widely recognized in the Boston arts community for her public
readings.
The Globe said Ms. Smith admitted the fabrications after being
questioned by Moore. Storin said that The Globe initially had
questions about six columns and that Ms. Smith admitted to
fabrications in four of them.
SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France He wears his hair to his
shoulders. He proposed to his wife in the Pacific Ocean surf,
holding her with one hand and his surfboard with the other. Even
into last year, Frankie Hejduk struggled to determine whether his
profession would be surfing or soccer.
Eighteen months ago, this free spirit was kicked off the U.S.
soccer team for missing a team flight to China. But his searing
speed, boldness in attack and renewed dedication have won him a
place on the World Cup squad. He provided the only scoring chance
in Monday's humbling 2-0 loss to Germany, and is expected to start
Sunday's crucial match against Iran in Lyons, where the Americans
hope that goals will come in bunches, like grapes.
When given the nod at halftime on Monday, with the United States
trailing, 1-0, Hejduk (pronounced HAY-duck) searched for something
to wrest his team from its timid start. Baseball players break out
the rally caps, but soccer players don't wear hats, so Hejduk went
to his rally shorts, turning his game pants around, number facing
the back.
The night before, he had practiced his trademark reggae dance in
his hotel room, just in case he scored a goal. And nine minutes
into the second half he launched a diving header that appeared to
be a certain score, only to be thwarted by a desperate reach from
the German goalkeeper, Andreas Kopke.
Against Iran, the Americans will again need his assertive
efforts to get behind what is considered a penetrable defense. Goal
scoring figures prominently in the tie-breaker system used at the
World Cup. The Americans feel they must win by at least two goals
on Sunday and win or draw against Yugoslavia next Thursday to have
any chance of advancing to the second round.
Hejduk is expected to replace Mike Burns at right wing in
midfield, and coach Steve Sampson is considering whether to play
with two forwards instead of one. The idea is that the Americans
must be aggressive from the beginning and not lie back as they did
against Germany.
