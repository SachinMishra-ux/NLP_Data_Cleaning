The test car had no rattles or squeaks, but slight vibrations
could be felt through the floor pan, doors and steering wheel, and
the suspension was bouncy. Quick stops caused awkward shudders.
While the C70 coupe can't figure out whether it's a lady or a
scamp, the convertible doesn't pretend to be a sports machine. It's
an upscale, head-turning cruiser an impress-the-neighbors
alternative to the Chrysler Sebring. Alas, you can have two
Sebrings for the tab of one C70. 
NEW YORK Chinese authorities in Shanghai on Thursday detained
the shipment of sets and equipment for a classic Chinese opera that
is scheduled to be the centerpiece of next month's Lincoln Center
Festival, threatening to disrupt the New York event and start an
international incident.
When the criticisms first emerged this week, Lincoln Center
informally asked the State Department and the U.S. Information
Agency to follow the situation. After Thursday's action, in which
the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture refused permission for
sets from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to leave the airport,
the State Department intervened.
At the same time, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln
Center, sought help from Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of
state, who is a friend of hers. Because the production is scheduled
to move on to the Festival d'Automne in Paris in November, the
French Foreign Ministry has also become involved.
An American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that it was not clear whether the Chinese government, which is
preparing for a visit by President Clinton next week, had played
any part in the matter.
The shipment in question, consisting of all the sets, props and
costumes for the production, was ostensibly held back for an
inspection of the contents, according to Lincoln Center officials.
The authorities allowed the containers to be reclosed, Redden
said, adding that he hoped they would be shipped on the next
available flight, on Sunday. But he said the authorities still had
objections to the production that could pose further problems.
For months, cigarette-industry executives have said they would
rather fight every lawsuit filed against them than support federal
legislation like the $516 billion tobacco bill introduced by Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. With the scuttling of the McCain bill on
Wednesday, they are now likely to get plenty of practice.
Today, over 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco companies,
a figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of such cases
in just three years. And along with health-related cases brought by
individual smokers, new groups of claimants ranging from
officials of states and cities to insurers and union health plans
to Indian tribes have also jumped into the legal chase.
