That performance earned Penders the head coach's job at Texas
vacated by Bob Weltlich, who went 77-98 in six seasons and was
fired in 1988.
Penders was 208-110 at Texas, winning more games than any
Longhorns coach. Texas, which had not been to the NCAA tournament
since 1979, went eight times in Penders' 10 years. His tournament
record was 10-8.
Penders resigned under pressure less than a month after four
players complained to Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds about verbal
abuse by the coach and lack of improvement in their games. Penders
was also under heat because an academic report for freshman Luke
Axtell was faxed to radio station KVET-AM by assistant coach Eddie
Oran in violation of privacy law.
Oran took responsibility for faxing the report, saying in a
written statement that he did it of his own volition. Oran has not
been available to comment on the matter, and Penders said he had no
knowledge that his assistant was going to fax the report.
HOUSTON An hour before a recent game, Astros owner Drayton
McLane, a county judge, the mayor and even a pseudo-commissioner
gathered in the bowels of the creaky, old Astrodome for what was
described as a major annoucement to secure the team's stability.
McLane, Bud Selig and friends did so much strutting you
half-expected the buttons on their shirts to fly off into the
audience.
The officials revealed the team's signing of a 30-year, ironclad
lease for the club's new stadium with 42,000 seats, a grass field
and a retractable roof that will retract, we suppose, on the last
day of the season if the temperature dips below 90.
Of course, it will also have 63 luxury boxes closer to the
field, better amenities, charter seat licenses, a ritzy venue
attractive to free agents and, you can be sure, a new name by the
time the $229 million park opens in 2000.
The Ballpark at Union Station, its current tag, sounds quaint in
the same manner of Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Rather, it will
until McLane sells the naming rights to Enron or Compaq or anyone
else with a spare $40 mil or so.
What Wednesday's news meant, besides the fact that the Astros
won't be moving to Northern Virginia, Round Rock or anywhere else
until at least 2031, is that McLane's pockets just got a little
deeper.
