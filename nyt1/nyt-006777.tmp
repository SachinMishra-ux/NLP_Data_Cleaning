He attended Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, N.Y., where his
closest friend was David Rusk, the son of Dean Rusk, the secretary
of state in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
He joined the Foreign Service in 1962 after graduating from
Brown University, and was sent to Vietnam.
In May 1968 he was sent to Paris as a junior member of the
delegation led by W. Averell Harriman to embark on his first
negotiations with the Vietcong.
Four years later he left government to become editor of Foreign
Policy Quarterly. After President Jimmy Carter took office in 1977,
Holbrooke came back to government to became assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, the youngest person ever
to hold an assistant secretary post.
From 1985 until he was named ambassador to Germany by Clinton in
1993, he was managing director of the New York investment firm
Lehman Brothers. A year later he was recalled to Washington to
become assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
affairs a rank he held almost two decades earlier.
But in the late summer of 1995, with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher's blessing, Holbrooke was handed the most sensitive and
high-profile mission of his diplomatic career: to promote a peace
plan for Bosnia.
Holbrooke lives with his third wife, the author Kati Marton, and
her two children, Elizabeth Marton Jennings, 18, and Christopher
Marton Jennings, 15, on Central Park West.
Holbrooke said the family plans to remain in their apartment;
his official residence as U.N. ambassador a $27,000-a-month suite
atop the Waldorf Towers will be used for official functions.
For months, cigarette-industry executives have said they would
rather fight every lawsuit filed against them than support federal
legislation like the $516 billion tobacco bill introduced by Sen.
John McCain of Arizona. With the scuttling of the McCain bill on
Wednesday, they are now likely to get plenty of practice.
Today, over 800 lawsuits are pending against tobacco companies,
a figure that represents a quadrupling of the number of such cases
in just three years. And along with health-related cases brought by
individual smokers, new groups of claimants ranging from
officials of states and cities to insurers and union health plans
to Indian tribes have also jumped into the legal chase.
