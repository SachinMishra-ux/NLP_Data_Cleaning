For Turtle Bay Towers, the new loan will enable the co-op board
to make repairs and reduce monthly maintenance fees by 10 percent.
The projected monthly fees will range from $800 to $2,200 on most
apartments, though they will be as high as $2,700 on a few units.
Rockrose, among other things, also will pay its share of the
building's improvements and sell the units a few at a time to
people who want to live in the building rather than in a bulk sale
to investors.
In exchange, the co-op extended Rockrose's lease on the
commercial space, hired the company to manage the building and
agreed to the improvement program.
Rockrose filed an amendment to its offering plan earlier this
week with the New York state attorney general's office. If it is
accepted, which is expected within 30 days, sales will begin.
Tenants buying apartments, which feature 10- to 12-foot-high
ceilings and open floor plans, will be given priority, but not a
discount from the asking prices. The units are to sell at an
average price of about $250 for each square foot of space.
For example, a one-bedroom unit with 850 square feet on the
seventh floor is expected to cost $188,000. In the area, from East
43rd to East 46th streets and from First to Lexington Avenues, the
average sale price of a one-bedroom co-op, typically with 843
square feet, is $182,000, according to Corcoran Group, a brokerage.
Singleton said the units would be renovated at a cost of $10,000
to $12,000 as they became available. Ten are now vacant, and when
leases expire they will generally not be renewed.
NEW YORK State Republican leaders coalesced behind the
re-election campaign of Gov. George Pataki on Thursday, offering a
display of unity highlighted by an effusive public tribute by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani to two of his most famous rivals: Pataki and Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato.
Giuliani's conciliatory remarks the closest he has come to
apologizing for fiercely opposing Pataki's campaign for governor in
1994 were contained in what had been expected to be a routine
five-minute welcome to 406 Republican delegates assembling in
Manhattan for the Republican State Convention.
Instead, Giuliani nearly overshadowed the renomination of Pataki
for another four-year term. The mayor spoke for 29 minutes in what
was a clear effort to redeem himself with state Republican leaders
whose support could be critical to his future as a state or
national candidate.
Giuliani's remarks came as the Republican Party effortlessly and, at times listlessly voted unanimously to designate Pataki as
its candidate for re-election. The party also nominated Mary
Donohue, a New York state Supreme Court justice, for lieutenant
governor, and Dennis Vacco for a second term as attorney general.
