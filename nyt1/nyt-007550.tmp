SAN FRANCISCO You've been there before, they tell him. And
that's supposed to make Tom Lehman feel better.
Like being tied to the tracks in front of a moving locomotive is
always much easier the second time around. Or standing before a
firing squad. Or having root canal without Novocain.
This will be the fourth consecutive year that Lehman has teed
off in the final pairing of the U.S. Open, which is the golf
equivalent of going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. All you're
trying to do is make it in one piece.
You know the sad history, you know that the last three trips
have wound up with him busted on the rocks and you figure that the
night before they strap him to the rack and start the torture all
over again, Lehman would either be climbing walls or one of the
many cypress trees that help make the Lake Course at the Olympic
Club a tight, tilted, twisted mind-trip.
If it had to be a Disney flick, you might think something
starring Goofy would have been more appropriate, since that's what
blowing three consecutive chances to win the Open could make
anyone.
But Lehman doesn't look like a guy who has stayed up nights
muttering to himself in the dark, replaying the videotapes and
re-living the misery. And there is plenty of that.
In 1995, he entered the final round at Shinnecock Hills tied for
the lead with Greg Norman but faded to finish third as Corey Pavin
won the title.
In 1996, Lehman held the 54-hole lead and played the last round
as a head-to-head duel with his buddy-on-tour Steve Jones. The two
devout Christians exchanged inspirational words throughout the
round, but it was Jones who was lifted to the win at Oakland Hills.
Last year, the site was the Congressional Country Club and the
story was the same on the last day. Lehman led the field going in
but splashed his second shot on No. 17, taking himself out of
contention as Ernie Els claimed the championship.
