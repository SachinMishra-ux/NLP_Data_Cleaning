With tornado watches in effect throughout the region at least
until early Monday, Doppler radar showed a twister may have touched
down in Worcester County Sunday night, the National Weather Service
reported.
Earlier, a funnel cloud was spotted in Pittsfield, according to
Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, but there were no reports that
it had touched down.
The storm swept eastward from New York state, but spared New
England much of the devastation it had wrought there. Trees blew
through homes and houses were leveled in Mechanicville, N.Y., north
of Albany, authorities reported.
But the storm was furious in its wrath here as well:
Golf-ball-sized hail tumbled from the sky above Walpole, N.H.,
leaving cars dented, said Marc Bennett, a Weather Services Corp.
meteorologist.
In Lawrence, Mass., almost two-tenths of an inch of rain fell in
seven minutes a phenomenal amount of water, Bennett said. And
Worcester Airport recorded a 94 m.p.h. wind gust after 10 p.m.,
said Doug Cope, information officer for Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency.
In Winchendon, near the New Hampshire state line, two men
driving a pickup truck along Route 202 were killed when a pine tree
snapped and toppled onto the 1994 Toyota pickup, just after 6 p.m.
Much of the damage occurred in Franklin and Worcester counties,
where trees and power wires were downed. Greenfield reported a wind
gust of 68 m.p.h., according to Jennifer Kensy, a Weather Services
Corp. meteorologist.
At its height, Western Massachusetts Electric reported 5,287
customers without electric, mostly in Greenfield, the Pittsfield
district, and later in west Springfield. Both utilities were
working to restore power last night.
The storm, blown in from New York state after 5 p.m., first
attacked Pittsfield, then tracked more northeast, cutting a swath
of precipitation and wind across the top of the state and into
southern Vermont and New Hampshire, Bennett said.
It was part of the same system that wracked South Dakota, said
Alan Dunham, meteorologist with the National Weather Service, of
the twisters that virtually leveled the town of Spencer, S.D.,
Saturday night. The storm then raged through the midwest, killing
several people.
