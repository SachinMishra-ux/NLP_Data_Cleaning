After several days of resisting their offer, the woman
threatened to go to police, according to detectives. The couple
then beat and suffocated her, later taking her body to Hunts Point
and dumping it in the river, police said.
WIMBLEDON, England Uneasy lies the head that doesn't wear this
crown: from crass teen-agers to cranky veterans, everybody's
clamoring to be the queen of Wimbledon this year.
Continuing a tradition that began, to some degree, here at
Wimbledon when the 15-year-old Lottie Dodd won the title in 1887,
women's tennis has become the proving ground of a bevy of teen-age
celebrities. Each of them is intent on looking and playing like no
one else in the world, especially their precursors, and each of
them is already famous regardless of whether she has actually won a
tournament.
The undisputed monarch of the bunch is a 17-year-old Swiss girl
who just recently began falling for boys instead of horses. Will
Martina Hingis put business before pleasure and defend in 1998 the
second of the three Grand Slam titles she monopolized in 1997?
There are 127 others, including five of Hingis' teen-age
compatriots among the top 30 players in the world, hoping she
won't.
Although Hingis admits she fears being beaten by her
understudies far more than she frets about facing her elders, Graf
is one veteran whose designs on the 1998 Wimbledon title are all
the more passionate because she recognizes that this could be her
last campaign on these lawns. Also, Graf is the only player,
veteran or not, to own a 5-1 record against Hingis that includes
two victories at this Grand Slam event. If Hingis and Graf, a
seven-time champion, weather the seven-round collision course, they
would meet in the final.
It would not exactly be a clash of innocence and experience.
These days tennis breeds millionaires, not innocents. More
intriguingly, it would be a clash of now meets then, of Hingis'
slick all-court calculations against Graf's stubborn baseline
power.
Graf, the 29-year-old German who was ousted from her perch atop
the ranking 15 months ago by Hingis, has accumulated nearly as many
surgeries as Grand Slam titles she holds 21 but she refuses to
surrender her sport to the youngsters. This spring Graf swore she
would retire if she encountered one more physical setback. Instead,
straight from cursing out every official who worked the lines
during her petulant loss to Kournikova at Eastbourne on Wednesday,
she is here, steeling herself to outlast the competition and seeded
fourth on the strength of her past laurels despite an actual
rank of 91st.
Another Grand Slam champion on the rebound is Monica Seles, the
24-year-old Yugoslav-turned-Floridian who made a rousing sprint to
the French Open final. That Seles counts no Wimbledon titles among
her collection of nine Grand Slam victories makes her bid almost as
urgent, and equally sentimental, as Graf's.
These are two outspoken generations of women's tennis merging
just in time for Wimbledon. With the possible exception of Venus
and Serena Williams, siblings who have already announced a dual
plot to dethrone the Swiss incumbent, the sisters who belong to
this sorority are anything but sweet and sisterly toward one
another.
Blithely self-aggrandizing is more like it, and that's making
for some scintillating feuds and rivalries, along with a potboiler
atmosphere: Hingis called Graf and her contemporaries a bunch of
past-their-prime players; Serena Williams slammed a ball at Sanchez
Vicario at Roland Garros and laughed it off; Kournikova has made it
clear that she doesn't just preen better than the rest, she wants
to play better, too.
