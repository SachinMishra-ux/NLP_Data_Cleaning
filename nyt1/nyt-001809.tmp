In the mid-1980s, home schooling was embraced by Christian
fundamentalists as a means of providing family-based religious and
moral education.
Recently, there has been a boom in secular home schoolers who
are dissatisfied with public schools.
The Florida Department of Education has for years sent a crude
survey to home schoolers asking them why they withdrew from the
regular system. Two years ago, for the first time, dissatisfaction
with the public schools was a more common answer than religious
preference.
According to Mary Anne Pitman, an educational anthropologist at
the University of Cincinnati, one fast-growing group of home
schoolers is black professionals, worried by the lack of safe,
effective public schools for their children.
Two decades ago, home schooling was illegal in many states and
strongly discouraged in most others. Students were hunted down as
truants; parents were arrested and sometimes even jailed.
In Minnesota, home schoolers must register, check in regularly,
and take part in standardized exams to make sure the children are
not falling behind. In Illinois, they are virtually unregulated.
Some states have become downright accommodating. Washington and
Iowa require the public schools to enroll children on a part-time
basis if they ask for it.
In California, children can enroll in an independent study
program through a public school and then do their studying at home.
Not surprisingly, the busiest opponents of all this are school
administrators, particularly superintendents. They can be expected
to have a belief in public schools, of course, but not all their
concerns are so well-intentioned.
Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
