Bush holds a equally lopsided lead over Mauro among the state's
voters, according to the most recent Texas Poll. Published
Thursday, the poll shows Bush favored by 70 percent of the state's
voters compared to 17 percent for Mauro. Mauro says the poll is
flawed and that a Democratic pollster shows him trailing Bush but
by a narrower margin, 63-28 percent.
Early next week, Mauro has scheduled his own fund-raising
excursion to Washington, where he will be joined by President
Clinton at a $1,000-a-person reception and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton at a $5,000-a-plate dinner. Vice President Al Gore
will attend a fund-raiser for Mauro in El Paso on June 25. All
three events are expected to raise about $400,000. XXXXXXXEND OF STORY
To that end, technicians at three Cadillac dealerships are
testing a new computer technology developed by the General Motors
Service Technology Group that lets them call up reams of service
information with a spoken request. Called Smart Mentor, the system
includes a small computer that can be worn by the technician and is
equipped with software that guides him through the diagnostic and
repair process.
Because of its advanced speech-recognition technology, the Smart
Mentor is easy to master even by people who have never used a
personal computer. The technician talks to the computer carried in
a pouch attached to the waist. A portable monitor hooks to the
bumper or fender of a car. The monitor displays text, animation and
video instructions to diagnose and repair the vehicle.
James L. Roach, senior project engineer for General Motors'
Service Technology Group, demonstrated the system at the New York
auto show in April, by telling the computer that a 1997 Cadillac
Seville had an electrical charging problem. A list of symptoms
popped up on the screen, and Roach selected those that the car was
exhibiting. The computer diagnosed the problem, suggested the tools
the technician needed to make the repair and displayed a diagram of
the area to be worked on.
The hands-free system allows the technician to continue working
without leaving the job to look up information in paper manuals or
a distant computer. In addition, Smart Mentor should help
technicians pinpoint problems more precisely, reducing the
possibility that they will recur.
Not only is this good for customer relations, the shortage of
service technicians requires that they work more efficiently. Two
years ago, GM chairman John Smith told the National Automobile
Dealers Association that by the turn of the century, 60,000
technician jobs would go unfilled.
The industry is looking to the military to fill some of those
jobs. Indeed, the Smart Mentor system was developed in cooperation
with a consortium that included the Defense Department and military
contractors. The same approach will be used by the military to
repair tanks and trucks.
Compounding the technician shortage is the increasing complexity
and additional electronics of today's cars and trucks. In 1965,
GM's service manuals contained 5,000 pages of text; the manuals now
run to 120,000 pages, and are likely to reach 200,000 pages within
two years.
ATLANTA -- The Cy Young Award has been passed around for a
couple of years. Greg Maddux apparently would like to have it back
now.
