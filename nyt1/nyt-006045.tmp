Under this theory, the impact of the glitch would be felt when
one computer system that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with
another computer system that thinks the year is 2000.
The theory continues: Because computers can't think, neither
system can understand why it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to
sort out the problem, the two systems would either stop or give out
wrong information.
Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist for the North American division
of the investment firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the potential
computer failures could prove devastating for many companies.
Steven L. Hock, president of Triaxsys Research Corp. of
Missoula, Mont., a consulting firm, said that nearly half of the
nation's 250 largest companies have disclosed no information on
their Year 2000 problem.
Of the companies that did provide some disclosure, most of the
information was so sketchy that it gave no clue as to where the
firms were in solving the problem, Hock said.
Only about 10 companies gave specific details on their progress
toward fixing or replacing bad computer systems and predicted
whether they would be ready by 2000.
He suggested that Congress require all companies to answer a
standardized set of specific questions on their plans for fixing
the Year 2000 problem.
Lynn Stout, a professor of securities law at Georgetown
University, said companies would continue to avoid giving full
information unless they are forced to do so.
