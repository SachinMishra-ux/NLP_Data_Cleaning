But lately, Cisco is on a collision course with a set of new,
much bigger competitors. Companies that have made their livelihoods
selling gear to the telephone industries are intent on moving into
Cisco's market.
These companies contend that their long experience in running
dedicated-circuit voice networks gives them an edge over Cisco,
which has specialized in sending data as packets distributed over a
variety of pathways between routers, the traffic controllers of the
Internet.
The most prominent of these new rivals are Lucent Technologies,
the spinoff of ATT Corp. that includes Bell Labs, and Northern
Telecom of Canada, Lucent's chief competitor in the supply of
conventional switches and other equipment for telephone networks.
Not only do they have the heft Lucent has three times the
annual revenue of Cisco but they also have the motivation. They
realize that the market for the equipment they have been selling,
which relies on setting up dedicated paths, or circuits, for each
communication, is quickly becoming doomed.
In the future, this dedicated-circuit approach, known as circuit
switching, seems destined to be replaced by more efficient and
economical packet-switching technology on which the Internet (and
Cisco's business) is based.
To overcome Cisco's leadership in data networking, Lucent and
Northern Telecom will be counting on their ability to transfer the
characteristics of voice network technology to data networks.
Yet Lucent and Nortel are still very much newcomers. Only this
month will Lucent begin testing its first billion-bits-a-second
packet switch based on Internet protocols, which could become a
true competitor to Cisco's most advanced gear.
Northern Telecom, for its part, derived only $785 million of its
$15.4 billion in revenue last year from data networking; it has a
long way to go to be on an equal footing with Cisco.
But then, in this transition from the old world architecture of
circuit switching to the new world of packet switching, it is not
altogether certain that Cisco plans to slug it out with Nortel and
Lucent.
Cisco's chairman, John Chambers reportedly broke off intensive
talks with Lucent about some sort of partnership because the two
companies' product lines had begun to overlap too closely. Now, he
is said to be bent on concluding an alliance with Nortel, which
could take advantage of its strengths in sales and service in the
telephone industry.
