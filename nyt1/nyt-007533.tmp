Her 100-meter time of 10.72 was seventh-fastest ever, coming
after a championship-meet record 10.71 in the semifinals. About an
hour after her sprint victory, Jones went 23 feet, 8 inches on her
opening effort to win the long jump. And then, despite pulling up
with 30 meters left, followed it up with a 22.46 in the semis of
the 200 second-best in the world this year.
Today, she's a heavy favorite to seal her triple with a victory
in the 200 meters. With a sharp eye on Sydney in 2000, Jones is
talking a possible five gold medal performance (including two
relays) something never accomplished in the sport. Here she is
earning well into six-figures, more than the pro leagues could
offer. And this on top of her Nike shoe deal.
If there was any rust, Jones shed it quickly last summer en
route to winning the 100 meters at both the national and World
Championships. Track Field News was impressed enough to name her
Women's Athlete of the Year not just in America, but the world.
Forget about recent American sprinters Gail Devers and Gwen
Torrence, they couldn't touch the times Jones is putting down. She
owns the world's best performance this year in her three events 100, 200 and long jump and for the first time in a decade
Florence Griffith-Joyner's sprint records are in jeopardy. And yet
because of her awesome speed, Jones' best showing yet may come in
the long jump.
At the Prefontaine Classic last month, Jones took the long jump
with a 23-11 3/4 leap, 7 3/4 inches off the world record in only
her sixth major long jump competition. That's without much training
and with only basic technique.
Matt Kuchar's brush with immortality notwithstanding, the 98th
U.S. Open has been all Payne Stewart. If the storyline changes
today and Stewart fails to finish off a wire-to-wire performance the first in a U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970 he would be
surprised if it involves a self-destruction.
While others were struggling Saturday in fast, sun-baked
conditions that forced precision shots to find the fairway and some
luck to find the cup, Stewart remained solid with an even-par 70,
finishing at 3-under-par 207, four strokes ahead of Tom Lehman (68)
and former Marietta player Bob Tway (73), who are at 1-over 211.
Former Georgia Tech player Stewart Cink of Smyrna is tied for
eighth, remaining in contention at 4-over 214 after a 73.
Attempting to win his third major today, the champion of the
1991 U.S. Open and 1989 PGA figures he only has to maintain what
brought him to this point. Stewart, 41, started the week with a 66
and hasn't faded. He began Saturday's round with an eagle at the
first hole and hung on.
If Kuchar, who turns 20 today, were to manage it now, it would
require a miracle. Finally encountering difficulties Saturday, the
U.S. Amateur champion from Georgia Tech bogeyed four of the last
five holes for a 76 and stands nine shots back at 5-over 215.
