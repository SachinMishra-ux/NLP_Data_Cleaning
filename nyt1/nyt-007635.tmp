Details of the negotiations between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's
legal team, which appeared Sunday in The Washington Post and were
confirmed by people with knowledge of the investigation, suggest
the two sides are still far from an agreement that would lead to
her testimony.
Starr still insists that Ms. Lewinsky agree to plead guilty to
some offense relating to an affidavit she submitted in the sexual
harassment suit brought by Paula Jones against Clinton. That suit
has since been dismissed.
Ms. Lewinsky's new lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein,
longtime members of Washington's circle of elite attorneys, insist
on complete immunity for Ms. Lewinsky in exchange for testimony
that she had sex with Clinton. This deal is exactly what her
previous lawyer, William Ginsburg, had sought from Starr.
The negotiating distance between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's new
lawyers is likely to give some solace to Clinton and his legal team
at the White House. While White House officials were being careful
Sunday to say nothing in public about these newest indications that
Starr is still a long way from a deal with Ms. Lewinsky, they made
no secret of the fact that they were pleased.
A person with knowledge of the strategy of Ms. Lewinsky's
defense team said the major uncertainty concerns what evidence
Starr may have collected in months of grand jury testimony, which
continues this week.
Starr has been trying to find holes in Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit,
and may be able to establish that she failed to mention some
meetings with the president. He is especially concerned with
meetings that may have taken place as the Jones case gained
attention around Christmas, just ahead of the long Saturday
afternoon in which Clinton was himself deposed in the case.
For the deposition, lawyers for Ms. Jones asked the president at
length about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky which
subsequently prompted the president to call in his secretary, Betty
Currie, and lead her through a conversation about her own memories.
Ms. Currie was Ms. Lewinsky's main conduit as she tried to reach
the president and send him gifts and a tape.
Ms. Lewinsky may be seeking to strike a deal in which she admits
to having had a sexual relationship with the president, but denies
that there was any effort by the White House to alter her
testimony.
But on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats have said
that an allegation of an affair, without related charges of perjury
or of an effort to alter testimony, is unlikely to lead to
impeachment charges.
Moreover, additional descriptions of some of the key evidence in
the case 20 hours of secretly tape-recorded conversations in
which Ms. Lewinsky describes the nature of her relationship with
the president suggest that Starr may have difficulty proving that
Clinton or his friend Vernon Jordan sought to influence Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony.
