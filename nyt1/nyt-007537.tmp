She holds her breath each time. Before the shooting, she thought
the worse thing that could happen to one of her children would be a
car accident. She never imagined the bullet hole in her son's
chest.
Darlene, 36, is the mother all the neighborhood kids go to,
either with their problems at home or for something to eat after
school.
The family has health insurance, so Lynn's medical bills are
paid. It's not about that, she says. She simply can't believe that
one child can shoot another with no punishment.
The clusters of houses were surrounded by fields. Kids dug
trenches and played tag. They climbed trees and ate the fruit for
lunch.
The shooting has taught Mark that no matter what he does as a
father setting curfews, teaching manners and what's right and
wrong, instilling a belief in God there's little he can do to
protect his kids once they leave his house.
But this man watching Lynn hit grounders to the younger
players is not angry. He takes a drag on a cigarette.
The Andrews family is close. Mark and his wife, married for 16
years, hug and kiss their children and tell them that they are
loved. It is hard for this man who survived heart surgery just a
few months ago to understand the disregard for life that led to the
shooting.
Lynn's best friend, Eddie Gardner, 17, a sophomore at South
Mountain High, is uncomfortable talking about the day his buddy was
shot. He still sees it in his mind, especially when he is trying to
sleep.
Gardner froze when the gun was fired that day. He saw Lynn
stumble into the living room and to the floor, blood pouring from
his chest and back. He ran to the home of a neighbor for help.
Meanwhile, the girl called 911.
Gardner ran to Lynn's trailer to get his mother. By the time he
got back, paramedics and police had arrived. Gardner was out of
breath.
