But the Padres did most of their damage in a six-run eighth
inning with their bats on their shoulders.
Danny Patterson relieved Eric Gunderson with one out and nobody
on in the eighth, after the Rangers had scored three runs in the
seventh to tie the score, 6-6. Patterson faced five batters and
walked four of them, forcing in two runs. The other batter he
faced, Wally Joyner, bucked the trend and actually used his bat to
hit a single.
The walk on the wild side left Patterson with a rather ugly
looking line: Five batters faced, no outs, one hit, four walks and
five earned runs, the final ones scoring when relievers Tim
Crabtree and Scott Bailes allowed the inherited runners to score.
Patterson was not the only reliever who couldn't get the job
done in the last two innings. Crabtree allowed a hit to Mark
Sweeney that allowed two of Patterson's runners to score, and
Bailes allowed two hits that got home Crabtree's runner. Steve
Finley had four hits, including three doubles, and drove in five
runs for the Padres.
Al Levine, recalled from Triple-A earlier in the day when second
baseman Mark McLemore went on the disabled list, allowed five runs
on five hits in the ninth.
Overall, the four relievers allowed 11 runs on nine hits and
five walks in the final two innings, all after Will Clark's
three-run homer in the seventh had brought the Rangers back from a
6-3 deficit.
It was an uncharacteristic performance. The relief corps entered
the game having earned six of the team's past 10 victories and had
a 2.72 earned-run average in the past 13 games. Coming into the
game, the Rangers had the lowest bullpen ERA in the league at 3.13.
It also was an uncharacteristic performance from Patterson, who
entered the game with a 2.70 ERA. The right-hander had walked five
batters in 20 innings, and never had walked more than three in a
game.
But against the Padres, he found the strike zone with only eight
of his 25 pitches.
Even though there are no physical problems as a result of an
off-season shoulder operation, Patterson said he doesn't feel as
well as he did last season, when he was 10-6 with a 3.42 ERA in 54
appearances.
