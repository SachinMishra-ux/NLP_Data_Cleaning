In the wake of the decision last week to not trade Randy
Johnson, Mariner officials have taken a bunker mentality, refusing
to comment on what their mind-set is regarding their team and their
options.
Their final word on the Johnson situation was that they won't be
trading the lefty this season. What this means is either the M's
aren't telling the truth, or they are willing to let the Big Unit
just walk away after this season with the promise of getting
nothing for him except two draft picks.
You wonder why so much time has gone by with no action being
taken to make a fix. The bullpen has crushed the Mariners' spirit
too many times. The defense has gone from bad to worse, which is
what happens to a team that's struggling.
You would think the best time to make a change has already come
and gone, which makes you wonder why time is dripping like molasses
and Woody Woodword's feet seem so stuck in all the goop.
Does ownership think Woodward and Piniella have the players they
requested in the offseason, so it's up to Woodward and Piniella to
get the job done now with the personnel in hand?
Are Piniella and Woodward, the team's vice president of baseball
operations, frustrated at what may have ultimately been an
ownership decision to not trade Johnson, since perhaps someone
keeps hoping the old Randy Johnson will just come out every fifth
day and pitch his brains out?
Is there such a split between Mariner ownership and the baseball
side of the organization that the franchise is now incapable of
arriving at a decision about what changes to make?
Although Piniella would not talk specifically, it seems as if he
and Woodward have determined what changes they need to make. Now,
the urgent question is when and if those changes can be made.
Meanwhile, evidence for the need of a shake-up keeps mounting.
After a four-error loss to the Dodgers Saturday, Piniella promised
some changes for Sunday's game. But when he wrote up the day's
lineup card, everything remained status quo.
Joey Cora was back out at second base. Russ Davis was on third.
The two biggest culprits in the Mariners' American League-worst
defensive department were sent back out to do the jobs they were
hired to do.
