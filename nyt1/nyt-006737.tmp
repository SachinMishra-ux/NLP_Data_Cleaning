The warning by the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
contained in a memorandum apparently sent to State Department
officials, was made public at the House hearing. The memo undercut
one of the White House's fundamental reasons for granting waivers
to allow satellite exports to China despite a ban imposed after the
1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square.
But the agency's advisory was not included in the State
Department's official recommendation to the White House earlier
this year. President Clinton approved the waiver last February,
despite objections from the Justice Department that it would
undermine an ongoing criminal inquiry into whether two satellite
makers divulged sensitive information to Chinese rocket scientists.
In an afternoon Senate hearing, Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., became
one of the first Democrats to openly criticize the shift of
licensing authority for commercial satellites to the Commerce
Department from the State Department in 1996.
The back-to-back hearings featuring the administration witnesses
capped a frenzied day on Capitol Hill over the wide-ranging China
accusations, which comes just a week before Clinton visits China.
George Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, updated the
House Intelligence Committee in a closed, 2-hour 30-minute briefing
on a series of conflicting government assessments as to whether two
satellite makers who are the focus of the Justice inquiry Loral
Space Communications and Hughes Electronics jeopardized
national security by discussing the results of their independent
review of a failed launch of one of their satellites on a Chinese
Long March missile in February 1996.
With little dissension, the House on Thursday approved a
resolution, 409-10, to create a special select committee to lead
the House inquiry into the China accusations. The 10 who voted
against the resolution were Democrats.
Despite the resolution's bipartisan backing, Democrats
criticized Republicans during the debate for spending too much
money on duplicate investigations of Clinton and Democratic
fund-raising practices.
And they expressed concern that the work of the select committee
would fall captive to what they called a Republican witch hunt to
tarnish Clinton and curry favor with conservative voters.
And by transferring commercial satellite licensing authority to
the Commerce Department, the Clinton aides said, the administration
was completing a shift that Bush started in late 1992. In a
nutshell, the State Department considers national security
implications for sensitive exports, while the Commerce Department
also weighs American commercial interests.
The General Accounting Office said this shift in licensing
authority had loosened controls of satellite exports. But Reinsch
disagreed, saying the administration had added safeguards,
including a broader role for the Pentagon and intelligence agencies
to review export applications. Critics say these protections still
fall short of the State Department's regime.
