Lasorda's relationship with Claire never was very good. Russell
used to be a loyal servant and late-night eating buddier once said
left-hander Omar Daal could be the next Mike Cuellar. Just more of
that Greg Brock/Duke Snider nonsense.
But Didier, now director of player personnel for Arizona, might
be on to something with Daal, the former Dodgers farmhand, although
Cuellar won 20 games four times with Baltimore and the 1969 Cy
Young Award.
Daal, who starts for Arizona today at St. Louis, had a
career-high nine strikeouts and a shutout through eight innings in
a 5-1 victory Tuesday night at Cincinnati, his first career
complete game. In his previous start, he beat the Angels 4-1 on
four hits in eight innings.
Daal's 2.82 ERA would be tied with the Mets' Mosato Yoshii for
No. 10 in the National League, but he was 101/3 innings short of
qualifying.
The Diamondbacks selected Daal in the second round of the
expansion draft as a starter, but he could not beat out Joel
Adamson in the spring and began the season in the bullpen, entering
the rotation May 5 after Adamson suffered a shoulder injury.
Arizona is 5-3 in his eight starts.
Daal has taken awhile to get here, going 10-2 in the winter
league in his native Venezuela in 1995-96 and 9-1 in 1996-97 as a
starter. Before this year, he had nine previous career starts in
parts of six big-league seasons with the Dodgers and Montreal
Expos.
Reed can't be replaced: Under normal circumstances, Mets
right-hander Rick Reed would be an easy All-Star selection for
Marlins manager Jim Leyland, especially after Reed had a perfect
game for six innings Friday against Florida.
But the issue isn't his numbers. It's the lingering memory of
his role as a replacement player with the Cincinnati Reds in 1995.
Reed is 8-3 with a 2.38 ERA, fourth-best place in the NL,
although those aren't even his best numbers. Reed is second in
batting average against (.205), walks per nine innings (1.6) and
on-base percentage against (.243). He trails only Greg Maddux and
teammate Al Leiter in slugging percentage allowed with a .307 mark.
Reed is second in hits per innings (.74) and baserunners per nine
innings (8.3 to Maddux's 8.1).
His strikeouts-to-walks ratio is 3.94 (67:17), which is third
behind Maddux and Curt Schilling, and in walks per nine innings
he's fourth at 1.64.
