Jeter, perhaps the Yankees' best player in the first two months
of the season, was placed on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with
a strained abdominal muscle, an injury he sustained while taking a
swing in Wednesday night's game. In his absence Thursday night, the
Yankees (41-13) pummeled the Devil Rays' Dennis Springer, who has
nine losses since April 7 the same number the Yankees' entire
team has in the same period. Hideki Irabu allowed only six hits and
one run in 7 1/3 innings, and Bernie Williams had three hits and
two runs batted in.
Jeter is hitting .325 with eight home runs and 34 RBI. He has
scored 52 runs, the most of any player in the major leagues, and
before his injury he ranked eighth in the American League in
batting average, second in hits, seventh in multihit games, seventh
in stolen bases. Many in the game believe that if the season were
to end today, Jeter could be the American League's most valuable
player.
Jeter, 23, swung and missed in the fifth inning of Wednesday's
game and immediately stiffened with pain. Jeter tried some practice
swings, pronounced himself fit and continued his at-bat, grounding
out. But after trying some throws before the next half-inning,
Jeter walked off, replaced by Luis Sojo, and was found to have a
mild abdominal strain. Torre said he expected Jeter to be ready by
the end of the 15 days on the disabled list, but noted the
sometimes indefinable nature of abdominal strains. Sometimes an
abdominal injury heals quickly, sometimes it lingers, and this
early in the season, the Yankees want to be sure.
Sojo, who after Thursday night's 0-for-4 is batting .174 in
limited action, will start in Jeter's place, with Scott Brosius
moving from the bottom of the order to fill the No. 2 slot where
Jeter has batted all season. The Yankees are somewhat vulnerable,
however, because their Class AAA shortstop, Gabby Martinez, is out
of action because of personal problems.
Lessening the blow, however, is the fact that the Yankees are in
a stretch of games against truly bad teams. They beat the hapless
Chicago White Sox on Monday and Tuesday, play host to the
dismantled Florida Marlins in a three-game interleague series
beginning Friday night and then travel to Montreal for a three-game
series next week.
And they completed a two-game wipeout of Tampa Bay Thursday
night. Orlando Hernandez mesmerized the Devil Rays on Wednesday,
and Irabu (5-1) overpowered them Thursday night, striking out six.
He struck out the side in the fourth, whiffing Fred McGriff, Paul
Sorrento and Bobby Smith in order. Graeme Lloyd finished the last
inning and two-thirds.
The Yankees jumped on Springer early, effectively deciding the
outcome in the first three innings. Springer walked Tino Martinez
to open the Yankees' second inning before Williams hit the first of
his three singles. Darryl Strawberry then blooped a hit over
shortstop, and when the ball skipped past left fielder Dwight Winn,
Martinez scored. Williams scored later in the inning.
Williams, who was named the AL player of the month for May,
slapped a two-run single in the third inning, giving the Yankees a
4-1 advantage; Williams has 26 RBI in his last 23 games. Paul
O'Neill capped the Yankees' scoring in the seventh with a solo home
run.
These Yankees continue to play on the fringes of history: The
best 54-game start in club history was achieved by the 1939
Yankees, who were 43-11. They lead second-place Boston by 10 games
in the loss column in the AL East; Baltimore, in fourth place, is
15{ games behind. The Yankees could win just half of their
remaining 108 games and finish with a 95-67 record, and that, in
itself, probably would be good enough to qualify for the
postseason.
The Yankees traded pitcher Willie Banks to the Arizona
Diamondbacks for a right-handed reliever, Scott Brow, and a minor
league pitcher, Joe Lisio. Brow, 29, flew across country and was
activated for Thursday night's game to replace Derek Jeter on the
roster. Brow, 29, had a 7.17 earned run average in 17 appearances
for the Diamondbacks. Banks, 29, went 1-1 with a 10.05 ERA in nine
appearances this season before being designated for assignment last
week. Lisio is being assigned to Class AA.
