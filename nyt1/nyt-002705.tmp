It didn't look like it would come down to Patterson and the
bullpen when the Padres erased a 3-2 deficit with four runs in the
fifth. The big blow was a three-run homer by Greg Vaughn on a
belt-high, hanging slider by Rangers starter Bobby Witt.
The Rangers got back in it with Clark's three-run homer to
center off Dennis Reyes, who was pitching in relief of Padres
starter Mark Langston. But Dan Miceli then came in for Reyes, and
held the Texas batters in check.
 BOSTON In the good times and bad, lefthander Steve Avery
always insisted he was a better pitcher than his time with the Red
Sox indicated. Finally, it's starting to happen for him.
What he did in his fourth start of the year, a 5-0 victory over
the New York Mets Sunday night at Fenway Park, was something the
Red Sox have wanted to see for a year and a half. He had prime-time
stuff, using a revised motion. Twice he snuffed out New York
rallies in situations where in the past he has folded like an
accordian.
When Jimy Williams sent Avery out for a start last September, it
triggered an option year in the pitcher's contract. The move was
controversial, and the Sox had to hope he would overcome health
problems and turn into a hurler who could give them some quality
starts and innings. Sunday night, he gave them his best outing
since a 3-1 victory over Cleveland last July 21, a seven-inning
stint that helped Boston salvage the final game of a three-game
series.
When he went 7 2/3 innings against the Indians, Avery was an
over-the-top fastball pitcher. Sunday night, using a new release
point, he was more a crafty veteran. In the fourth inning, just
minutes after his teammates had just given him a 4-0 lead, Avery
put runners on first and third with none out. He escaped. In the
seventh, he put two runners on with one out, and again New York
failed to score. He left after throwing just 84 pitches.
Avery's changeup and curve are more effective when his fastball
is better. He threw 24 changeups, 18 for strikes. That's big for a
guy who decided to give the new motion a try only last Tuesday in
Toronto.
Avery retired the first nine batters he faced. Then, in the top
of the fourth, he gave up a 420-foot triple to Brian McRae and an
infield single to Edgardo Alfonzo, McRae holding. But Avery got
Bernard Gilkey to fly to short right, with both runners holding.
And as John Olerud struck out on a 3-2 pitch, Hatteberg not only
caught the foul tip but threw a bullet to second base, cutting down
Gilkey for a double play.
The Sox put it away in the third, sending nine batters to the
plate against Masato Yoshii, the veteran Japanese hurler. All four
runs scored after two were out.
Darren Lewis started it with a line single off the Wall. Lewis
stole second and scored on a single up the middle by Reggie
Jefferson. Nomar Garciaparra doubled into the left-field corner,
sending Jefferson to third. After a walk to Vaughn, Troy O'Leary
followed with a base hit to center, scoring Jefferson and
Garciaparra and sending Vaughn to third. Then John Valentin doubled
to right, scoring Vaughn.
