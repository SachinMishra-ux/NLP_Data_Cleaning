Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.

A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
