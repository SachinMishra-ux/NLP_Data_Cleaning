You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
