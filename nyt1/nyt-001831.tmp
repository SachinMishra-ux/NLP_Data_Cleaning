Almost everywhere you turn, the financial services industry is
offering free software to analyze whether you should convert your
traditional Individual Retirement Account to a new Roth IRA, which
allows tax-free withdrawals.
Say you have $100,000 in your IRA and expect to stay in the 28
percent tax bracket, that you anticipate 8 percent annual pretax
growth and that you will take all your money in a lump sum 20 years
from now.
The analyzer disk distributed by T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore
mutual fund company, calculates that after you have paid taxes up
front to convert to a Roth, you will have $466,096 to spend in
2018. That is a hefty 12.4 percent more than the $414,649 after
taxes at withdrawal if you stick with a traditional IRA.
But plug the same facts into the Roth analyzer from Merrill
Lynch and it calculates that you will have far less, no matter what
you do: $390,843 if you convert to a Roth and $335,589 if you do
not.
The calculator of Strong Funds, the mutual fund company based in
Menomonee Falls, Wis., generates the same figure as T. Rowe Price
if you convert and the same as Merrill Lynch if you don't.
Not everyone can convert: To qualify, you must have less than
$100,000 of adjusted gross income (the last number on the front
page of your Form 1040 tax return).
If you convert this year, Congress has a special deal the
taxes due at conversion must be paid in four annual installments,
which amounts to a slight discount on the tax bill. People who
convert in future years must pay the taxes all at once.
The multitude of Roth analyzers, even when they use the same
methodology, often generate slightly different figures because of
subtle differences in their programs, like whether earnings are
compounded annually or daily, and whether the taxes are assumed to
be paid on Jan. 1 or April 15.
If you expect your tax rate to be higher when you retire than it
is now, switch to a Roth. But if you expect your tax rate to fall,
the decision gets complicated, depending on how much your tax rate
drops and how many years will pass before you retire.
The T. Rowe Price, Merrill Lynch and Strong calculators come up
with different figures because each treats taxes differently especially the upfront payments to be made when converting a
traditional IRA to the Roth version.
