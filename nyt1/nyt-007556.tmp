Phil Stewart was a good enough golfer to compete as an amateur
in the 1955 U.S. Open on the same Olympic Club course Stewart has,
to this point, hog-tied. The elder Stewart didn't fare nearly as
well, shooting rounds of 83 and 88 to miss the cut.
Of course, as Bee Stewart felt compelled to point out to her son
Saturday, the rough 43 years ago was knee-high, instead of ankle
deep. Given that Stewart missed seven of 14 fairways Saturday, he
should give thanks for small blessings.
While he is at it, Stewart should kiss his putter; aside from
the most-replayed putt of the tournament (his 3-putt on the
diabolical 18th Friday), Stewart has been able to conquer all the
greens in two strokes or less.
He vowed to play the course the same way today as he has all
week. He'll leave the prevent defense to his beloved Dallas Cowboys
and aim for the flag, but only when there's a clear opening. That
was the case on No. 1 when he hit a driver off the tee, a 5-iron
second shot to 20 feet and made the putt.
Lehman has beat himself up over his near misses some, but not
much. He, more than most, has a firm grasp of what's really
important, which is why he could be found after his round on the
practice range, stopping between swings to watch his 8-year-old
daughter Rachael hit golf balls with his 5-iron.
ANAHEIM In the posh new visitors' clubhouse at Edison Field, a
side door leads to a well-appointed gym. In there, among other
fitness equipment, is a bench-press rack with 45-pound disks, a
curling bar, some enormous dumbbells and the requisite mirror
covering an entire wall.
(For some strange reason, all of this lies just beyond one table
laden with doughnuts and another heaped with a decadent array of
candy.)
When the Texas Rangers hit town this weekend, several players
puffed and sweated in the room in the mid-afternoon, but Juan
Gonzalez, breaking from one-time routine, wouldn't step near it. He
remained at his locker, lifting nothing more than the corners of
his mouth.
Texas has played 73 games this season and Gonzalez has appeared
in each and every one of them, along the way rifling bullets to all
fields and driving in 88 runs, a major-league lead that even Mark
McGwire can't touch. If Gonzalez can maintain that pace for 158
games this year, he would break a major-league RBI record that has
stood for 68 years since Hack Wilson of the Chicago Cubs drove in
190 in 1930.
In the past, any such bid was always foiled by a lengthy absence
to injury. Gonzalez has not reached the 135-game mark in any of his
last four seasons. Why, even when he won the American League Most
Valuable Player award in 1996 he missed 28 games because of injury which is an indication of just how thoroughly he can savage
pitching when he is sound.
