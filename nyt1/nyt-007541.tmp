Government statistics say domes tic violence is underreported by
10 to 1. Having experienced more than 40 physical assaults, with
only four resulting in arrest and conviction of the batterer, I
guess I fit the statistic.
But I am not a statistic. I am a woman, with a name, a life, a
family. Please remember that be yond statistics are real people somebody's mother, daughter, sister and friend.
In domestic violence, abuses oc cur mainly in private. Good
people do not seem to be able to compre hend that a man is abusing
his wife and family.
But that also seems to be the case even when the abuses are
witnessed. While I was separated from my husband, he learned I had
gone to church without him. He demanded to know who I sat next to,
who were the men there.
I didn't answer, and he began pulling me into the car, twisting
my hair around his fists, pulling and pushing me back and forth
over the 18-month-old sitting on the seat next to him who, of
course, began to scream.
My head was slammed into the door frame, my leg bruised by my
trying to use it to brace myself. In the blur of it all, I managed
to get the baby out of the car and into the house before the abuser
sped off.
People pass off domestic violence as the responsibility of the
system. But the justice system did not stop the assaults against
me. This time a third assault conviction the abuser was allowed
to avoid the court order to attend treatment. I came to realize
there exists what I've come to call the chain of discretion.
At any point in this chain the police officer, then the
prosecutor, then the judge an abuser is likely to talk his way
out of it.
Of all the women I've known whose abusers were arrested and
prosecuted, I have never known a judge to impose a maximum sen
tence.
Imagine trying to regain nor malcy while living in an unfamiliar
place in close quarters with people you don't know. The intimacies
of life's private tragedies are lived out in full view of one
another; children disoriented, the hourly tensions, the crying.
