Bob Habush, a lawyer who represents the state of Wisconsin, said
that while some states have lost ground waiting to see what
Congress would do, others like Wisconsin have been proceeding
actively.
Some initial settlement efforts have been made to try and
restart settlement negotiations between the industry and some state
attorneys general, but one industry lawyer called the talks very
preliminary.
Ms. Aronson and other legal experts added that while they
believed the industry could overcome many of the claims filed
against it, the legal landscape remained troubling for producers.
They pointed out that new claimants like health insurers and
union health plans were assaulting cigarette makers for the first
time. And while those actions might not initially succeed, the
success of one could open the door for others.
In addition, the outpouring of secret industry documents and the
steady drumbeat of negative articles and television programs about
tobacco producers was likely to have an impact on jurors, Ms.
Aronson and others added.
NEW YORK With less than three months left before 14,000
4-year-olds are supposed to begin new prekindergarten classes
established by the state, New York City's overcrowded public school
system is planning to enroll a third of those children in private
and parochial preschools.
Unable to squeeze the preschoolers into public schools ripping
at the seams, officials expect to use public funds to educate about
5,000 children in private schools. It is a rare example of the
city's public school system relying on the private sector for basic
academic services; the only precedents are smaller programs in
counseling and tutoring.
The state law that established prekindergarten classes
encouraged local school districts to draw up contracts with private
preschools. The law requires each district to devote at least 10
percent of its funds to contracts with private agencies, and
education officials in Albany said the requirement was added
because they knew many districts would be unable to find the space
or the qualified teachers on their own. The private preschool
industry, worried about losing business, also lobbied heavily in
Albany.
When state lawmakers enacted the law establishing the $500
million program last summer, they allocated money for teachers and
aides, but none for construction, despite the space problem.
Since then, translating the language of the law into reality has
flummoxed school officials across the state, especially in New York
City, which now expects to be spending 35 percent of its state
allocation for the program on private and parochial schools.
