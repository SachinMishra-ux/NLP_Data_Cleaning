So, here's my suggestion: The Pataki administration not to
mention the administrations of other states around the country should offer the state prison system and the local jails the same
sort of bounties for jailed welfare cheats that the feds are
offering for jailed Social Security cheats. The worst that can
happen is that jailers won't catch any extra cheaters.
Need I say Woods? Need I say the most famous sports hero in the
world, even for those who don't quite consider golf a sport?
The only break you get from hearing his name is when the
marshals hush the crowd before a shot, and thank God for that bit
of etiquette.
Etiquette crumbles somewhat when the Tiger stampede starts. When
it's coming at you, you know how Custer felt when he saw the Sioux
nation coming.
Except this nation comes in all races, ages and color of polo
shirts, and you don't die, except maybe of boredom. This is golf,
after all.
It starts with the tiny figure of Tiger Woods swinging a club
far in the distance. Before the ball finishes rolling 290 yards
toward you, the horde of uncountable thousands is coming your way
along the sidelines.
Tiger Nation isn't quite what you'd think it is. Most Tiger
stalkers were like most golfers older white guys who'd look right
in a Lexus. Tiger is a golf phenom, not an ethnic phenom.
Sure, there were a lot of young people. At 6:30 a.m. high school
students Nancy Luu and Jason Cunningham already had staked out
seats in the top row of the bleachers at the 18th hole.
The complexion of the crowd at the U.S. Open had changed quite a
bit since the last time it was at the Olympic Club in 1987. There
were hundreds of African Americans, Asian Americans and Asians.
Shinichi and Chikako Saito came all the way from Osaka, Japan, to
watch the tournament in their new Stanford University sweat shirts,
and yes, watch Stanford's most famous alumnus.
I saw a teen-ager in a Tupac Shakur T-shirt and baggy pants,
which led to the most interesting clothing clash on the course all
day.
