But this time, he will play the role of the hunter instead of
the hunted. Lehman, at 1-over par, stands four strokes behind
leader Payne Stewart, who remains the only player under par (3
under) through 54 holes at the 6,797-yard, par-70 layout.
The role reversal, he said, could prove beneficial. But Lehman
downplays suggestions that he is overdue to win an Open after
finishing third, second and third, respectively, the past three
years.
Instead, Lehman relishes the chance to be the one playing with
nothing to lose during the final round at the Open while someone
else handles the mounting pressure of maintaining a lead.
It proved to be more than Lehman could handle at Shinnecock
Hills Golf Club (1995), Oakland Hills Country Club (1996) or
Congressional Country Club (1997), where the former Colonial champ
burst from the pack with third-round efforts of 67, 65 and 68,
respectively. Factor in yesterday's effort and LehmanUs third-round
scoring average for the past four years is 67.
His average final-round score for the past three years, on the
other hand, is 72.7. Playing without pressure, Lehman hopes, will
help him close with an effort more like the one he turned in
yesterday.
Lehman started with three consecutive birdies, all after
approach shots inside 15 feet. Over the next three holes, he
surrendered all three strokes, taking bogeys after drives into the
rough. But he rebounded with a chip-in birdie at No. 14, followed
by a six-foot birdie putt at No. 18.
That one, he said, was especially crucial from a mental
standpoint after four-putting the 18th green to conclude his second
round.
When Robinson's crosschecks of voter registration records,
telephone databases, the Registry of Motor Vehicles and other
sources did not turn up some individuals mentioned in the columns,
top editors decided it was time to discuss the matter with Smith.
So Moore set up a lunch at 1:30 p.m. last Wednesday at the Royal
Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge.
In the course of two hours, Moore said, Smith went from
defensive to silent and finally to reflective. She admitted that
four of the people were figments of her imagination.
The four fabricated characters include: the cancer patient
Claire; a worker named Jim Burke who was erecting barricades for
the Boston Marathon; a cosmetologist named Janine Byrne, who was
commenting on the case of kidnapping defendant Stephen Fagan; and a
woman named Dorothy Gibson whose young daughter was getting a
painful hair makeover for Easter. Burke and Byrne are basically
supporting characters in those columns, but Claire was the heart of
the column and the fact that Gibson didn't exist cast doubt on the
entirety of that column. All four columns were published in April
and May of this year.
