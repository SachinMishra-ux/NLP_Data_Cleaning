These are the sounds of Broadway, which is on a roll after years
of hand-wringing. Tonight, with the annual Tony Awards celebration,
Broadway officially closes the book on its most successful season
in history.
Preliminary data from the League of American Theatres and
Producers indicate that more than 11.3 million people saw a
Broadway show this season, breaking the previous attendance high
notched in 1980-81.
Box office income reached an estimated record high of $545
million, a 9.2 percent increase over last season. In December, 23
musicals were running on Broadway the most at any time in modern
history. And the top ticket price for musicals spiraled to $75, a
$5 increase.
Actually, some ticket prices rose even higher. Livent Inc.,
which produces Ragtime, added a $1 surcharge making its tickets
$76 to defray the construction costs of its new Ford Center for
the Performing Arts. Then it established a $125 ticket that
includes entry to a VIP lounge at intermission, refreshments and
free coat check. Who says elitism is dead on Broadway?
Another factor in the attendance and sales records is the way
the theater district is cleaning up its act. Two renovated and
restored, state-of-the-art theatrical palaces have opened along the
formerly tacky, now tourist-friendly, neon-bright 42nd Street
corridor.
Still, it was a bullish year on Broadway. But will this brisk
business spill over into upcoming seasons, or is it a mere fluke?
It seems aggressive marketing from the League of American
Theatres and Producers is working, with Broadway trumpeted through
syndicated television specials and upbeat Web sites. (To see how
they crow about the season, click on http://www.broadway.org.)
In time, the reasoning goes, theater-going habits may take root,
and Broadway could have new patrons for life. So not only is
Broadway not dying, it is sprucing itself up, preparing to sprint
into the 21st century. HAP'S PICKS
Here are my predicted winners of this season's Tony Awards. Tune
in Sunday night to see instantaneously how far off I was.
The canvas is vast and the results are epic, as director Frank
Galati deftly balances so many story lines, and Graciela Daniele's
nimble, musical staging shows the clash of cultures in movement. In
the huge cast are such Tony-worthy performers as Brian Stokes
Mitchell, powerfully towering above the fray as firebrand Coalhouse
Walker, and the ethereal Audra McDonald as his washerwoman lover
reaching out to grab the American Dream. Peter Friedman is fiercely
protective of his daughter and later amusingly aristocratic as
upwardly mobile Tateh. And the delicate Marin Mazzie strikes a
personal chord with her soaring soprano, turning Mother's journey
of self-discovery into the spine of the show.
