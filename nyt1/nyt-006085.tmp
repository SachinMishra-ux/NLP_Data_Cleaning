You don't have to be Italian or have roots in Brooklyn to enjoy
peering through this window of life into the Italian ghetto of
Brooklyn at the beginning of this century. Raised in a house where
Grandfather did the cooking, Schiavelli writes of a world where the
families were Sicilian first, Brooklynites second and Americans
only a distant third. He writes of their rituals of life that give
meaning to the food, and the recipes. Chicken soup is not just
soup, it is the specific meal served to the family taking care of
children during a funeral service. Veal cutlets were the staple at
the Men's Club and fried fish the essentials of Christmas Eve in
Bruculinu . It is a book with soul.
For a slightly different look on the world, pick up Mangia,
Little Italy! Secrets from a Sicilian Family Kitchen , by Francesca
Romina (Chronicle, $18.95 paperback), which is based in lower
Manhattan's Little Italy section, adjacent to Chinatown. Romina
also interweaves stories and family recipes.
From my view, Reichl is the most talented writer among newspaper
food critics, so this is a good read. Just don't expect insights
into the restaurant or reviewing businesses. A few recipes are
scattered through the memoir, none of them her mother's.
E The Perfect Recipe : Getting It Right Every Time, by Pam
Anderson ($27, Houghton-Mifflin) is a good choice for serious cooks
who have yet to subscribe to Cook's Illustrated magazine. Anderson
is is executive editor of the magazine known to foodies for its
exhaustive testing, revising and retesting of recipes, with
perfection in mind. Much of the material appeared in Cook's, where
they kitchen trials range from roasting 40 turkeys or 20 prime ribs
just to find the answers. Readers will find out why brining a
turkey produces the best Thanksgiving bird, and why the milk goes
in before the butter for perfect mashed potatoes.
E Great Pies and Tarts, by Carole Walter (Potter, $35). Don't
just cut to the recipes. Even if you are confident of your
pie-baking skills, be sure to browse the first 100 pages of this
book, particularly the chapter devoted to technique.
The tips alone from this respected cooking teacher are worth the
price of the book. Did you know that old eggs separate more easily
than fresh eggs? That cream close to the expiration date will whip
better than very fresh cream? That a sifter should never be washed?
That citrus zest that has been finely grated will be more pungent
than zest that has been minced?
The first part of the book is fairly encyclopedic but then come
the recipes. The array of pastry recipes is tempting, from toasted
coconut pie pastry or pine nut pastry to cookie-and-nut crusts made
with everything from biscotti or amaretti to ginger snaps. Basics
such as apple and lemon meringue pie are included, but this teacher
stretches the pastry imagination to put a sweet risotto filling in
an almond crust. Very precise instructions make it easy for even a
novice to succeed with the recipes.
E Born to Grill, An American Celebration by Cheryl Alters
Jamison and Bill Jamison (Harvard Common Press, $27.95) is the one
major grilling book of the season, and it's one of the best choices
if a collection of recipes is all you're after.
Moving from the world of slow, wood-smoked barbecues in their
bestselling Smoke Spice , the authors now explore the realm of
open fire grilling. Big flavors dominate the recipes in this book.
It's a good choice for a last minute gift for Father's Day. Maybe
he'll read it and have something new for the Fourth of July.
AUSTIN Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed as much for
marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one of the
inventors of the Johnny-Light.
