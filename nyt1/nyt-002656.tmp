But aides to Peter Vallone, the Council speaker, said Sunday
night that the Council had another response up its sleeve. It will
meet Monday morning and, turning to an arcane section of the city's
property tax law, draw the $251 million from a reserve fund that
covers property tax shortfalls, the aides said. Taxes will not go
up, they insisted.
The escalating fight over $251 million which represents
seven-tenths of a percent of the $34.08 billion budget underscored yet again how political hostilities have complicated
the annual budget negotiations between Giuliani and Vallone, who
until now shared harmonious relations and, in the recession of the
mid-1990s, were able to agree on deep cuts in services in almost
every area of the city.
In a normal year and especially this fiscal year, which is
expected to end June 30 with a record $2 billion surplus budget
officials from both sides might have settled such picayune
differences over drinks at one of the many bars near City Hall. And
the agreement would have been announced at a carefully orchestrated
photo opportunity, with Vallone and Giuliani flashing smiles at
television cameras, shaking hands and slapping backs.
But budget talks collapsed last Monday amid much chest-beating
and a political deadlock. The mayor, who wants to use city money to
help build a new home for the New York Yankees, possibly on the
West Side of Manhattan, wanted Vallone to drop his call for a
November referendum on the issue. But the speaker refused, saying
the referendum had nothing to do with budget talks. Vallone, who is
seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, has a political
base strongly opposes any suggestion of moving the Yankees out of
the Bronx into Manhattan; what's more, in a general race against
Gov. George Pataki, a referendum on the November ballot would
increase voter turnout in Democratic strongholds like the Bronx and
Manhattan.
NEW YORK For The Daily News, the rainbow of new color pages is
still somewhere over the rainbow, and the search for the best way
to keep the color inks free of water continues, but the lawsuit
that the paper's parent company filed against the company that
supplied the balky newsliner presses is over.

ASIA-ECON (Ban Wan Yai, Thailand) In the 11 months since the
economic crisis exploded in Thailand and began spreading through
the region, the most prominent victims have been the humbled
tycoons in the big cities, and they have fallen farthest. But the
worst off are those who were already at the margins of society those who had almost nothing before and who now, somehow, have even
less. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
ITALY-POMPEII (Pompeii, Italy) There are two Pompeiis on the
bay of Naples, and it is not always clear which is the dead city.
One, crawling with tourists, guides, workmen and archaeologists,
hums with activity. The other, where the unemployment rate is 30
percent, boasts crumbling buildings, faded hontytonk signs, old
people and stray dogs sleeping in the sun. A journal by Alessandra
Stanley.
KOSOVO-REBELS (Tropoje, Albania) The rebels who escort
refugees across the border into Albania boast proudly that they are
holding a stretch of road near Pec against Serbian soldiers. But
none are able to explain how dying for this piece of asphalt
advances the rebel cause. By Chris Hedges.
EXCLUSIVE-WARMING-CLIMATE (Undated) The White House will
announce on Monday that according to an analysis by government
scientists, El Nino joined the Earth's continuing overall warming
trend to break global temperature records in each of the first five
months of 1998. By William K. Stevens.
