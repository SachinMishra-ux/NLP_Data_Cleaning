Once the SEC drafts a 12th school, big-time college athletics
would be found in five 12-team conferences: ACC, Big Ten, SEC,
Pac-10 and Big 12.
And there would again be peace in the collegiate valley. At
least until those five conferences get fed up with the NCAA's
meddling and decide to form their own association.
TENDEX is a rating system originated in 1960 that blends 10
statistical categories into a formula to show the number of points
per minute a player is worth to his team.
The formula regards each possession as worth about one point.
Everything that contributes to scoring and getting the ball
(points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks) is measured on the
plus side. Everything that results in loss of possession (missed
shots and turnovers) is a minus.
After computing the statistics, adjustments are made based on
the pace of play and strength of schedule.
Game-pace rating is determined by considering all of the
statistics for a team and all of its opponents to come up with a
number that serves to balance the ratings of players on
high-scoring offensive teams with those of players on conservative
offensive teams.
Because it's easier to rack up big statistics against weak
opponents, a strength-of-schedule factor is added to make all teams
equal.
The result is a three-digit TENDEX rating, not unlike a batting
average in baseball. This is then given a plus or minus rating
comparing that player's rating to the average rating for that
position. The best players are the ones whose ratings are highest
above the positional average.
Step 5: Figure Oregon State's team game-pace rating by computing
the pure stats total for the entire team and multiply that by .8,
which is .9111. Divide .7072808 from above by the team's game pace
(.9111) to get .7762932.
Step 6: Figure Oregon State's strength-of-schedule rating by:
adding the conference rating for each opponent and dividing by the
number of games in the season. For example, say there are 30
conferences rated 1-30 and all opponents for that season are from
the Big 12, which is rated No. 1. That would be 30 divided by 30
games, which would be a strength of schedule rating of 1.000.
Oregon State's strength of schedule rating is 1.088. Divide
.7762932 from above, by the the strength of schedule rating (1.088)
to yield Benjamin's final TENDEX rating of .713.
