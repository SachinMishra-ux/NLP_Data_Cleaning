The different look has not been in the explosive offense alone.
Galarraga gives the Braves a right-handed threat in the middle of
an order once top-heavy with left-handed hitters and therefore
vulnerable to left-handed pitchers.
Left-handed relievers could be brought in to force a
switch-hitter like Chipper Jones to his less potent right-handed
side, then dominate left-handed swingers like McGriff and Ryan
Klesko, as the Yankees' Graeme Lloyd did so memorably in the '96
Series. Now Galarraga sits nestled between Jones and Klesko and the
effect is trickling up as well as down.
While Galarraga and shortstop Walt Weiss are the most notable
additions, the Braves also shored up their once questionable
supporting cast, which, like the bullpen, paled in comparison to
the Yankees' waves of onetime all-stars in October 1996.
The Braves still don't have the likes of Darryl Strawberry,
Cecil Fielder and Tim Raines coming off the bench, but they have
added some experience in the form of Gerald Williams, Curtis Pride
and Ozzie Guillen.
Williams, a former Yankee reserve outfielder and onetime regular
in Milwaukee, has played sparingly. But a pair of doubles and two
RBI in a spot start against Florida last week were indicative of
the contributions he and other substitutes are making.
The Braves have not only added offense and depth since last seen
by the Yankees. They eradicated some concerns over the defense up
the middle. Not only did the Braves add the smooth-fielding Weiss,
but they also said goodbye to center fielder Kenny Lofton. The
former Gold Glove winner inexplicably failed to impress afield in
his one season in the National League.
In Lofton's place stands the young Andruw Jones, who first
turned heads when at age 19 he hit two dramatic home runs in Game 1
of the '96 Series.
While these added elements bring a new dimension to a now
entrenched 1990s rivalry, the Yankees will find some things about
the Braves a time-honored continuum, namely Maddux, Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz.
Millwood, Andruw Jones, Javier Lopez and Chipper Jones stand as
proof that the Braves, much like the Yankees, grow quality players
as well as buy them. And like the Yankees' Andy Pettitte, Mariano
Rivera and Derek Jeter, the young Braves show a certain maturity by
welcoming the veterans' input.
After the two games in New York and the two in Atlanta are over,
both clubs will have a measure of how they match up, important
because this is more than an interleague curiosity piece. The
Yankees and Braves are providing hints of what might come in a
World Series rematch many believe is as inevitable as it would be
intriguing.
