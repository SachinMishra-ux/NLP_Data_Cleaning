The Mexican Workers Confederation known by its initials in
Spanish, CTM which Velazquez headed, is still Mexico's largest
labor body by far, representing some 10 million workers. But last
year Ms. Barrales helped found a rival federation, the National
Workers Union, which now represents some 1.5 million members and
appears to be growing fast.
During the first decades after Velazquez helped forge the
postrevolutionary labor movement in the 1930s and 1940s, his
official federation, which forms one wing of the long-governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won important
improvements in wages and working conditions in exchange for
turning out the vote on election day.
But after 1982, the year of a watershed debt crisis, Velazquez's
official unions worked mainly to discipline workers into tightening
their belts as inflation and devaluations cut into real wages.
Sidney Weintraub, an economist at Georgetown University's Center
for Strategic and International Studies, cited government
statistics in a recent article outlining the extraordinary erosion
of Mexican wages. In 1980, he said, Mexican manufacturing workers
earned 22 percent of what their U.S. counterparts earned. By 1996,
Mexican wages had fallen to 8 percent of U.S. wages, he said.
Few groups of workers have felt this decline more painfully than
the country's airline employees. In the wake of a 1988
privatization, two-thirds of Aeromexico's 12,000-member work force
were eliminated, and workers who managed to keep their jobs lost
pensions, seniority rights and virtually every other benefit.
If some Aeromexico workers viewed the sacrifices as an
investment in the company's future, the altruism soured in 1994,
when Aeromexico's high-flying chief executive suddenly fled Mexico
after government accusations that he had embezzled $72 million from
the airline. He, in turn, through his lawyers, accused PRI
officials of shaking the airline down for $8 million in
election-year contributions even as the company was sliding into
bankruptcy.
Since Ms. Barrales was elected president of her union in 1995,
she has been watching Aeromexico's balance sheets, which have been
improving. She said the company earned nearly $100 million in
profits last year. An Aeromexico spokesman declined to divulge the
official figure.
Before the strike, Aeromexico's most senior flight attendants
earned about $7,400 a year, compared with about $42,000 on U.S.
airlines, according to union statistics. Saturday's agreement will
raise salaries by 18 percent and establish a retirement plan.
The explosion occurred a little after 4 a.m. near Khairpur, in
the southern province of Sindh, as the Khyber Mail train was making
its run from Karachi to Peshawar.
The blast went off under a seat in the middle of a crowded
economy-class passenger car, wounding about 32 people in addition
to the 23 who were killed, Pakistan Railway officials said. The
dead included four women and two children
