Trump plans to convert the estate into a golf course and build
10 mansions, he said, and a 38,000-square-foot limestone mansion,
built in 1917, will be converted into a clubhouse. It will include
three dining rooms, a bar and lounge and men's and women's locker
facilities.
The Trump project furthest along in the approval process is the
reconstruction of the Briar Hall Country Club in Briarcliff Manor.
Trump purchased the property and adjacent parcels around it a
total of 146.5 acres in 1996.
Trump plans to build 87 residential units in Briarcliff Manor,
30 of which will be in a four-story building adjacent to the
clubhouse. The remaining residences will be clustered in 22 two-
and three-unit town houses to be built near the clubhouse.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. The J.C. Nichols Co. board of directors on
Friday dismissed a rival offer of $70 a share for the company made
late Wednesday and urged shareholders to vote for the merger with
Highwoods Properties Inc., which has offered $65 a share.
Nichols said the higher offer, made by Blackacre Capital
Management of New York, paralleled what Nichols called similar
empty overtures made since the Highwoods deal was announced in
December.
Nichols included an extra ballot in the letter so shareholders
who have not voted could cast their vote immediately.
Officials with Blackacre said they would decline to comment
until they saw the Nichols letter.
Blackacre, which owns 14 percent of Nichols, made the offer
contingent on several conditions. One centered on Nichols breaking
the Highwoods deal and only paying $2.5 million in termination fees
instead of $17.2 million.
Nichols could only pay that fee if shareholders vote down the
merger, Nichols said. And because Blackacre's offer extends only to
July 2 one day after the Nichols special meeting to consider the
Highwoods merger there's no guarantee that Blackacre would make
an offer, Nichols said.
Nichols also downplayed Blackacre's stated intent to exercise
appraisal rights in the Highwoods deal and the effect it would have
on other shareholders.
