Jaret Wright angered the Yankees in spring training when he hit
Luis Sojo with a pitch, breaking his hand and spurring their belief
that he threw at Sojo intentionally. But Wright confirmed his place
on the Yankees' most hated enemies list Friday night, when he hit
Paul O'Neill with a pitch and then appeared to glare at the Yankee
outfielder.
O'Neill yelled at Wright as he walked to first base, with Umpire
John Shulock escorting him most of the way, to keep O'Neill calm.
Of course, they could always get an intriguing late trade offer,
like the one last week from Milwaukee Bucks general manger Bob
Weinhauer, who was shopping former All-Star point guard Terrell
Brandon or one of two first-round picks for a move up the selection
ladder.
Barring an unexpected trade or meteoric rise from a surprise
prospect such as Michigan's Robert Traylor, the Mavericks have
targeted their Final Four.
They are planning to select either Saint Louis guard Larry
Hughes, Kansas forward Raef LaFrentz or one of two North Carolina
teammates, forward Antawn Jamison and guard Vince Carter, with
their No. 6 pick. Nelson brought only those four players in for
private workouts and seems content to add one of them most likely
Carter or LaFrentz to a team that last season went 20-62 and
missed the playoffs for a league-high eighth consecutive time.
In what is becoming a consensus scenario among NBA personnel
types, Arizona guard Mike Bibby, Pacific center Michael Olowokandi
and Kansas forward Paul Pierce are expected to go 1-2-3 in some
order. That leaves the Mavericks third in line for the four players
that round out the draft's top tier. Hughes is one of the draft's
fastest risers and Jamison is considered a top-five pick, possibly
leaving Dallas with a choice between the athletic-but-raw Carter
and the polished-but-soft LaFrentz.
The Mavericks, who also have the 30th, 35th and 53rd picks,
enter the draft seeking a pace-pushing point guard and a bulky
backup center. But as for the four players who could slide to No.
6: VINCE CARTER 
At 6-foot-7, 215 pounds and possessing an unmatched first step
and leaping ability, Carter was one of the nation's best finishers
as a junior last season. He averaged 15.6 points per game, but was
never forced to consistently knock down the open 15-footers he will
have to bury as an NBA shooting guard or small forward.
During workouts for Vancouver, Golden State, Denver and Dallas,
Carter impressed with his shooting form if not his results.
With the Mavericks, Carter could play shooting guard, sliding
Michael Finley to small forward in case Nelson remains pessimistic
of re-signing free agent Cedric Ceballos. RAEF LaFRENTZ
