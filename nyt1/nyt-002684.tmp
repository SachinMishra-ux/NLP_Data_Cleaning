is called NBA.cam, which allows computer users to watch the NBA
Finals through one of four small robotic cameras placed in the
Delta Center in Salt Lake City and the United Center in Chicago. If
someone else is already playing with the cameras, you get to see
what they're looking at....
There is England the remarkably successful self-described
keeper of the sport where controversial decisions and rabid fans
are as abundant as ever.
There is Colombia, a soccer hotbed of South America, where
passions run so deep that four years ago a player was killed,
reportedly by mobsters, after an own-goal against the United States
led to the Colombians' ouster from the tournament.
There is Romania, a classic Eastern European side with
experience, talent and flawless execution. And there is Tunisia, a
group of creative North Africans with a style all its own.
It stands to reason, then, that picking a winner out of this
group has proved more difficult than last December when these
nations were drawn together.
After the World Cup draw, England was penciled in almost
immediately as the team to beat in Group G. But not so fast. After
playing well throughout qualification last year, obviously
determined to make up for failing to qualify for the World Cup in
1994, the English side has since struggled on the field and made a
hugely controversial decision off it.
Paul Gascoigne, a popular player whom many consider the greatest
midfielder in England's history, was cut from the World Cup roster
late last month by coach Glenn Hoddle. The move stunned the nation
and spawned numerous debates across England and within the team.
Gascoigne was the only player on the English roster with World Cup
experience, from England's semifinals appearance in 1990. He also
was considered the only true playmaker.
But on top of ankle and groin injuries that slowed Gascoigne
during World Cup training, he was a well-known carouser and
admitted hard drinker who regularly found himself on the cover of
the British tabloids.
That much became clear during recent English exhibition matches.
After only one half of a game against Belgium last month, Gascoigne
asked to be removed from the field, citing a leg injury.
