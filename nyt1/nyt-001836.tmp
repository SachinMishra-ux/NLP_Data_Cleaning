While others scramble to divine the stock market impact of, say,
a nuclear test on the Indian subcontinent, the folks who run the
Calvert World Values International Equity fund spend much of their
time on a broader question. Is the nuclear testing right or wrong?
The first thing investors should know is that the ethical
compass used by Calvert World Values differs from of domestic
Calvert siblings a difference that the company readily
acknowledges.
For example, Calvert expects its American companies to derive
virtually none of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol. But
Calvert World Values can invest in companies that derive as much as
10 percent of their revenues from tobacco or alcohol.
The fund cannot buy shares of companies that earn more than 10
percent of their revenue from weapons contracting, which is the
same restriction its parent applies in the United States. But in
America, Calvert applies extra screens, for example, knocking off
all companies that net the top 85 percent of the Defense
Department's weapons contracts.
There are some absolutes. The fund will not buy shares in
companies that use child labor or forced labor. And because their
countries are on Calvert's short list of human-rights abusers, the
fund would be hard-pressed to own shares in companies based in
Burma, China or Nigeria.
How does the fund work? The portfolio is managed by Andrew V.
Preston, director of Murray Johnstone International, based in
Glasgow, Scotland. Preston starts with a top-down approach,
searching for markets that are relatively undervalued. Then, he and
seven Murray Johnstone analysts search for stocks with good
earnings-growth potential and reasonable valuations.
After Preston has selected a list of likely stocks, he goes
through the social criteria prepared by Calvert and tosses out
those that don't make the grade. (Calvert won't say how many.)
When the fund decided that Germany was looking attractive, it
zeroed in on Daimler-Benz. That automaker did not fit its social
criteria Calvert won't say why so the fund bought Volkswagen
instead.
Since its inception in July 1992, Calvert World has returned
10.8 percent, annualized, compared with 11.5 percent for the
average foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago. But through May 29, its three-year
average annualized total return was 14 percent, versus 12.5 percent
for its average peer fund. For the 12-month period, it returned
15.2 percent, versus 13.8 for its average peer.
As for the fund's biggest current holdings, there are a lot of
staid financial firms: Zurich Insurance of Switzerland, Banque
National de Paris and Fortis, a Belgian insurance company.
