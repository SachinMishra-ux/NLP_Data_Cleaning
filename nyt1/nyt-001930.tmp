Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
More than 100 apple trees some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
