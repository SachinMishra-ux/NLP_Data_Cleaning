And if not exactly high fashion, they are stylized in a variety
of trendy shapes. Liz Claiborne is doing them in three silhouettes
for women. The Gap ad shows wide legs and hip riders.
But are they cutting-edge? Hardly. Khakis date to mid-18th
century British armies and colonialism. The World War I soldiers
liked them enough to tote them home with them from battle.
Part of the appeal in a busy world today is probably the
versatility. They look good with a white T-shirt, a navy blazer, a
button-down or silk shirt.
Skip them for most weddings, fancy parties, executive board
meetings or a reunion of beatniks, but if you don't know what to
wear otherwise, keep khakis handy.
The next time you're scrounging through your crowded closet in
search of, say, your best white pants, it's OK to feel a touch of
envy toward singer Mariah Carey.
Pity the poor dear. She has to put on a robe and ride the
elevator down, just to get dressed.
UNDATED: Perhaps you find the ups and downs of hemlines
confounding. Maybe the blimp-shaped shoe-topping skirts and fuzzy
high-necked sweaters from fall fashion runways unnerve you. Or with
all the choices, you simply don't know what to wear.
It has made an impressive return to fashion's front ranks this
year after dawdling for a time in the shadows behind the T-shirt,
tank top and turtleneck sweater.
Indeed, the white shirt is easy to understand and it's
appropriate almost anywhere. Ask actress Sharon Stone, who skipped
beaded designer gowns to wear her husband's white shirt with Vera
Wang's silk wrapped skirt at the most recent Oscar presentations.
Draped nonchalantly, with the top buttons left casually undone,
the shirt remains one of the sexiest garments ever, showing coyly
from beneath a pinstriped trouser suit or topping well-worn jeans.
