ON LINE A new magazine, Online Investor, is aimed at those who
use the Internet for financial research and investing. It is
published every other month by MVP Media in Chicago. Jan Parr, the
editor, said it might go monthly early next year. Money.com, a
one-time special issue by Money magazine on the same subject, will
be on newsstands until Aug. 10. A Money spokeswoman said it could
become a regular publication.
Funds are closing at a record rate this year. But according to a
new report issued by the Kobren Insight Group a lot more of them
should be slamming their doors.
Kobren Insight, an investment management firm in Wellesley
Hills, Mass., lists 11 funds that for various reasons it said
should be closed to new investors.
The reasons cited in the report run the gamut from a fund's
ability to maneuver quickly to over-diversification. What's
surprising is the number of high-performance, high-profile funds
that make the list, among them Janus, Vanguard Windsor II, Fidelity
Equity-Income and Mutual Discovery.
Fund companies are often loath to close even those funds that
have swollen asset bases because the fees they receive are figured
as a percentage of assets under management. The larger the fund,
the bigger the fund company's pay check.
Warburg Pincus holds less than $1 billion, which gives manager
Brian S. Posner, who used to manage Fidelity Equity-Income II,
opportunities that the Fidelity fund is just too large to grab. The
strategies are similar, although the Warburg fund is slightly more
value oriented than the Fidelity fund, Goldfarb said.
Goldfarb said investors should not scramble to buy shares if
these funds announce they will close to new investors. He added
that there's no point in dumping shares, either, if you hold them
in a taxable account and you have large unrealized gains.
Twentieth Century Ultra uses an earnings momentum strategy that
often requires the fund to trade quickly in response to earnings
disappointments or rejiggered forecasts. At $26 billion, it may
soon be too large to move nimbly, Goldfarb said.
Gunnar Hughes, a spokesman for American Century, which runs
Twentieth Century Ultra, said the fund has more good investment
ideas now than the money to buy them, and has experienced no
liquidity problems.
The $22 billion Janus fund is not only a giant in its own right,
it also owns many of the same stocks as other Janus funds. In the
aggregate, then, Janus managers may have trouble moving large
blocks of stock without pushing up market prices, Goldfarb said.
