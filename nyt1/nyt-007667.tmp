The vote was as much an attack against Khatami as it was against
Noori, and it is part of a wider campaign led by conservative
members of the clergy to discredit officials loyal to the
president.
The parliamentary session was broadcast live on radio and later
on television as millions of Iranian viewers were awaiting the live
broadcast of the World Cup soccer match between the United States
and Iran at 11:30 p.m. Both opponents and supporters of Noori
stepped up to the lectern in the center of the modest parliamentary
hall to air their views.
Noori was reflecting the position voiced repeatedly by Khatami
and his supporters that what is at stake is nothing less than the
soul of the nation. According to this line of thinking, unless Iran
becomes freer at home and more open to the outside world, it will
lose the allegiance of the generation that has been born in the 19
years since the monarchy was overthrown.
But Khatami is fiercely opposed by those clerics and their
followers who believe that the core beliefs of the revolution are
being sacrificed.
Nateq-Noori had been the front-runner for president and lost in
an upset to Khatami.
Noori, 49, a mid-ranking cleric from Isfahan, has been an
outspoken proponent of Khatami's commitment to impose a rule of law
and has come under fire for issuing permits to allow groups to
conduct peaceful demonstrations.
Under the constitution, the country's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and not the president, controls the
judiciary, as well as the military, radio and television and the
intelligence and security services.
But Khatami has encouraged Noori to challenge decisions by the
judiciary particularly the arrest of Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karabaschi, who is on trial on corruption and embezzlement charges.
The trial is broadcast on television in the evenings.
Noori has also strongly supported Karabaschi and has openly
criticized the chief of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi,
for arresting the mayor in April without telling Noori.
In another sign that he had no intention of surrendering to
Parliament, Khatami appointed Mostafa Tajzadeh, a deputy minister
of the interior, as the acting minister. Tajzadeh, a staunch
supporter of the president, was also criticized Sunday by some
members of Parliament.
