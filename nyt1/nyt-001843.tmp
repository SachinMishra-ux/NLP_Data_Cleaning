BUFFALO, N.Y. For the first time in their 24-year history, the
Washington Capitals are going to the Stanley Cup finals. They
earned their berth Thursday night by beating the Buffalo Sabres by
3-2 in overtime to clinch the Eastern Conference finals, 4 games to
2.
Washington's Joe Juneau scored the winning goal at 6 minutes 24
seconds of overtime when he charged toward the crease and knocked a
loose puck over the goal line after Buffalo goalie Dominic Hasek
failed to cover it. The play was fashioned by Brian Bellows of the
Capitals, who stickhandled around the defense on the left side and
fired the first shot against Hasek. Hasek was sprawled in his
crease and reaching with the glove on his left hand when Juneau
knocked it in.
The Capitals will face either Detroit or Dallas in the
championship round, which will begin Tuesday night in the arena of
the Western Conference winner. The defeat ended the brilliant
season of Dominik Hasek, the Buffalo goalie who led the Czech
Republic to the gold medal in the Olympic Games last February.
Although Hasek and his teammates are through for the season,
Hasek is a finalist for both the Hart and Vezina trophies, given to
the league's most valuable player and its best goalie. Despite
Hasek's great efforts this season, the Capitals are also led by a
good goalie: Olaf Kolzig. Born in South Africa, raised in several
places in Canada and an international player for Germany, Kolzig
has been, consistently, the best goalie remaining through the first
three rounds of the tournament.
The teams exchanged goals in the second and the third periods.
Playing in his first postseason game this spring, Paul Kruse of the
Sabres scored at 7 minutes 40 seconds of the third period to break
a 1-1 tie. After a long shot by defenseman Bob Boughner, Kruse and
his linemates charged and created congestion in front of Capitals
goalie Olaf Kolzig. The puck may have hit Kruse as it passed
through.
Washington evened it at 2-2 at 14:01 on a power-play goal by
Peter Bondra. Geoff Sanderson was in the penalty box for
interfering with Dale Hunter of the Capitals, a call that was
bitterly protested by the Sabres and their fans. Bondra, uncovered
in front of the net, knocked the puck past Dominik Hasek as the
goalie tried to scramble back into position, from left to right.
After playing a scoreless tie for more than 33 minutes, the
teams exchanged even-strength goals within a span of 22 seconds,
and the score stood at 1-1 going into the third period. Scoring for
Buffalo was Michael Peca, who slapped the puck past Kolzig at 13:04
after a pass from Dixon Ward. The goal finished a rush that formed
at the other end after Washington had maintained pressure for an
entire shift. The Capitals got the goal right back at 13:26 when
Esa Tikkanen, uncovered next to Hasek's crease, turned in a shot by
Mark Tinordi.
The Sabres came into the game with the momentum of a 2-1 victory
in Game 5 in which they were out-played and out-shot by 35-16. The
difference in that one was Hasek, who emerged from a mini-slump to
perform brilliantly in what may have been his most important and
impressive victory since he lead the Czech Republic to a gold medal
in the Winter Olympics in February.
The Final Four round, both East and West, has been a goalie
story. Except for Kolzig the netminding has been erratic and, in
some cases, below standard. In the West, where Detroit holds a
three-games-to-two edge over Dallas, Chris Osgood of the Wings and
Ed Belfour of the Stars have taken turns making major mistakes.
He redeemed himself in Game 5 while his young teammates were
being overwhelmed. That was not the case in the first period
Thursday night. It ended scoreless, but the Sabres had played
better and had a 16-10 edge in shots. Both coaches started their
muscle lines: Chris Simon, Hunter and Craig Berube for the
Capitals; Rob Ray, Kruse and Wayne Primeau for the Sabres.
