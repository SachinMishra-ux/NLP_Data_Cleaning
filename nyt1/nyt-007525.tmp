SAN FRANCISCO It's a story that Boys' Life would not publish.
It's fiction so far-fetched, you'd send the Hardy Boys into
gut-breaking laughter. Surely, the schmaltz police would surround
you.
OK, just for laughs, can you run that by me again? You say the
kid, a gangly golfer who grins more than a guilty politician, turns
20 on Father's Day while he's playing in a U.S. Open as an amateur
and beating many of the world's best players? Are you serious?
Granted, he's the U.S. Amateur champion from Georgia Tech and
arguably the best college player in the nation, but what's that? A
final round on Father's Day, with his father, Peter, on his bag?
As a rule, Kuchar had been following double-bogeys with birdies,
and staying cooler than the ocean breeze. As a matter of fact,
after playing two days with Kuchar, defending champion Ernie Els
was ready to say the kid would be right there today, with a
mind-boggling reason to remember a 20th birthday and Father's Day,
1998.
It's no surprise that Kuchar proudly defends his father. Peter,
the insurance and investment man from Lake Mary, Fla., is living
every dad's dream, having caddied for his son during an Amateur
victory and now in two majors. While Kuchar obviously draws
inspiration and finds a calm from his presence, it's Dad who gets
so demonstrative by cheering, jumping and college-type high-fives
that he occasionally disturbs fellow caddies and players.
That a son doesn't care to rob his father of a lifetime thrill,
regardless that he gets carried away, only adds to the son's
character.
Fun is the optimum word for both Matt and his Dad. It is costing
Peter about $30,000 to play around the world this summer they are
in Scotland for the Loch Lomond Invitational in two weeks, followed
by the British Open in England but surely it will return to the
family kitty in the near future. How near is the real question. For
the first time, Matt is waffling a bit when asked about the pro
issue. College is fun, yes, and he has two years remaining. But a
lot has happened lately. It's obvious he can play with these guys,
or outplay them. He began the third round seven shots ahead of
Tiger Woods.
The death of Professor Jonathon William Faulkner was accompanied
by a curious inheritance left to his students: $1 million for the
one who could solve a mystery hidden in his 10-room mansion.
With that fictional premise, a Scottsdale company lured
thousands of computer sleuths into buying a $50 game and
competing in an arduous contest that promised $1 million to the
real-life winner.
The twist has sent angry players of the Treasure Quest software
game on a new mission trying to find out whether the
award-winning games is as bogus as Professor Faulkner's will.
