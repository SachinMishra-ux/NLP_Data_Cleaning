No one knows this more than his fighters, to whom he's
passionately devoted. So many have become part of the Main Events
and Duva family.
Mismatch?: Rafael Ruelas will be a significant underdog when he
faces Kostya Tszyu in a title-elimination bout on Aug. 15.
Many observers have rolled their eyes at the prospect of the
matchup. Prevailing wisdom says Ruelas, with 55 fights, has
deteriorated as a fighter and couldn't possibly contend with
Tszyu's skill and power.
Well, if anyone can pull a surprise under these daunting
circumstances, it's Ruelas, who rose from two knockdowns to beat
Freddie Pendleton and win the IBF lightweight title in 1994.
When John Sykes took over as president of the cable channel VH1
in 1994, he had a theory:
The channel started in 1985 with the purpose of staving off
competition for MTV. That year, Ted Turner had started a competing
music channel, so MTV Networks offered VH1 free to cable operators,
killing off the threat. But the channel's identity as a separate
music network was never firmly established.
In the four years since Sykes took over, VH1 has found a formula
that has significantly increased its ratings and driven up profits.
Indeed, VH1 has the highest concentration of advertisers' most
desirable viewers, those 18 to 49. As a result, advertisers from
American Express to Lexus have added VH1 to their buying plans.
Indeed, the United States' largest cable operator,
Tele-Communications Inc., had already dumped VH1 from more than one
million homes to accommodate several channels in which it owned a
financial interest, including Fox News, Animal Planet and Home and
Garden. Fortunately, Sykes said, VH1, with its new adult-music
format, had managed to build up some loyal fans by then, both in
the television audience and in the music industry.
The reason this somewhat startling development can be true is
that neither CBS, ABC nor Fox earned much money if any this
year. So the $42.5 million in profit for VH1 for 1998, as estimated
by Paul Kagan Associates, looks good by comparison. The results for
MTV shows the potential for a cable channel, with the channel
making about $250 million during the same period.
But VH1 is looking good by comparison in several areas,
including its overall appeal to viewers between 18 and 49, the
favorite group of most advertisers. According to Nielsen Media
research, VH1 has the highest concentration of those viewers about 88 percent of its viewers fall in that range in all of
cable.
