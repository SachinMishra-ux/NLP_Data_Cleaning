TRENTON, N.J. In less than a minute, the New Jersey Assembly
passed legislation Thursday that would enable Prudential Insurance
Co. of America to convert from a mutual company, owned by
policyholders, to a publicly traded one.
The bill provides a framework for compensating Prudential's 11
million policyholders in the form of stock. Consumer advocates have
praised the company for its pledge to return its full value to
policyholders but say the bill contains loopholes that could
shortchange consumers. The bill does not limit executive
compensation and does not detail how the value of the company will
be determined.
The Senate is scheduled to vote on an identical bill on Monday.
Elizabeth Randall, the state commissioner of banking and insurance,
must approve the company's final reorganization plan.
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico More than 6,000 telephone workers went
on an island-wide strike Thursday to try to stop the sale of a
controlling stake of the government-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
to a consortium led by the GTE Corp.
The strike began with several confrontations between picketers
and the police on the same day the Puerto Rico Senate approved the
$1.8 billion sale. The House was expected to do the same by
Saturday.
But the sale, in which GTE has agreed to buy a majority stake in
the telephone company 50 percent plus one share for $375
million, is not expected to be completed until the end of the year,
pending regulatory approval, including that of the Federal
Communications Commission.
Many countries where telephone companies have been state
monopolies, particularly in Latin America, are privatizing the
concerns. But the government here has faced heated public
opposition to selling what many view with nationalistic pride as a
profitable public asset that could compete in an open
telecommunications market. Workers also fear massive layoffs from
Connecticut-based GTE, which has said it would honor existing labor
contracts and would not dismiss any employees for at least one
year.
Michael Masin, vice chairman of GTE and president of
international operations, said the company had yet to assess
whether dismissals would be required. But he added that the company
planned to offer financial inducements for workers to leave
voluntarily if necessary within the first year.
The strike's first day began on a violent note when shoving
matches broke out broke out between riot police officers escorting
managerial workers to their offices and striking workers who tried
to block their way at several buildings here. In a chaotic
early-morning scene captured by television cameras, police officers
hit and jabbed workers with nightsticks as they clung to an
entrance gate to prevent anyone from entering.
About 1,400 of a total of 1,800 management employees made it to
work on Thursday, the telephone company said, with some ferried by
helicopters to the roof of the telephone company's headquarters
here. Others rushed through picket lines with food and pillows.
Superintendent Pedro Toledo of the police department recommended
long stays for those working to minimize confrontations.
