Wednesday, her body, with more than 10 stab wounds in the back
and neck, had been found in the kitchen of the apartment they
shared on the banks of the Hudson in this suburban village, which
had not seen a murder in 20 years.
A short time before the body was found, Laudor's mother, Ruth,
concerned about a conversation she had had with her son, had called
police and asked them to check on the welfare of her son and Ms.
Costello in the apartment.
Laudor, 35, was arrested at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.,
a place where, as a teen-ager, he had taken a summer program for
gifted students. For inexplicable reasons, he had fled to Cornell
on Wednesday afternoon, driving Ms. Costello's black Honda to
Binghamton and then catching the 10:15 p.m. Shortline bus to
Ithaca.
At Cornell, he flagged down a patrol car and told an officer
that he had hurt his girlfriend and possibly killed her, said
Simeon Moss, director of the Cornell News Service.
Taken into custody, he was alternately calm and agitated and, at
one point, struck a Cornell police officer, who was be treated at a
local hospital.
Thursday afternoon, Laudor, a tall, husky, bearded six-footer
dressed in a blue Ithaca City Jail jumpsuit and bedroom slippers,
was returned to the Hastings police station, next door to where he
lived and visible from his balcony. There, he was formally charged
with Ms. Costello's murder. He had no prior record for violence.
Friends spoke of two setbacks that seemed to weaken him in his
fight against schizophrenia. In 1995, his father, Charles Laudor,
an Adelphi economics professor who often talked him through the
hallucinations and was a stabilizing influence in his life, died of
prostate cancer. In recent months, the antipsychotic medications he
had been taking no longer worked as well and doctors struggled
futilely to find the right prescription.
As a result of his recurring mental illness, he was withdrawn
and depressed and making little progress in writing the life story
on which the lucrative movie was going to be based, friends said
Thursday. They said they believed that the pressure of writing,
even as he was unable to land a job as a law professor, contributed
to his decline.
Advocates for the mentally ill tried Thursday to ward off any
public conclusions that people with schizophrenia needed to be
feared.
Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill in Washington, said that dramatic shifts in
behavior occurred when people stopped taking their medication.
