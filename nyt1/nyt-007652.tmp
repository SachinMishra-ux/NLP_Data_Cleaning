While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the
Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the
Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a
cookbook emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not
to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a
broad public fascination with the developments of modern science,
including advances in nutritional understanding.
When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down,
Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's
science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of
recommendations that finally led Michel to the 23-year-old Miss
Mathiot, who said yes.
Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of
French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an
immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books
on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.
In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books
appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs
down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.
A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with
millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate
survivors, never took anything for granted.
Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end
had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the
oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant
moment, would have one more instruction: Turn off the oven.
He knows that they know much more than anyone about the
penetration of the White House by Asian fronts for Chinese
intelligence. They have all the details about Indonesia's Riady
family's long-term investment in his career, and probably of
instructions to influence his post-election change of trade policy.
Clinton must assume it is in China's interest to provide an
escape hatch for 50 fleeing witnesses, to deny being the source of
millions in campaign contributions and to keep secret Democratic
money laundering done by Hong Kong and Macao banks. China will want
to conceal from the Justice Department and Congress the illegal
donations to, and policy penetration of, the White House and DNC.
In obstructing any investigation, the interests of China run
parallel to those of this compromised U.S. president. Both Clinton
and the Chinese want nothing further to come out. Accept, if you
wish, the protestations of Clinton defenders that his campaign
organization was duped by John Huang, Charlie Trie and Maria Hsia,
and was ignorant of the source of the Asian funds solicited from
Johnny Chung. Buy, if you like, the notion that the payments had
nothing to do with flip-flops on trade and the technology-transfer
triumph over the Pentagon by anything-goes Commerce.
Would they use this illicit leverage to gain a concession? Of
course not; Chinese diplomacy can be exquisitely subtle. No winks
of understanding will be needed.
