Today, Cohn, managing director of the Crowne Plaza Hotel in
downtown Phoenix, stands by those words and says the city's
convention center could be headed for even tougher times.
Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio said the Civic Plaza is
vulnerable, not only to the East Valley's plans but to those in
other cities around the country.
Cohn points to an exhibit hall list that placed Phoenix at No.
13 in 1990, ranking the size of the country's convention centers.
By 1993, Phoenix slipped to 34 and reportedly has fallen even
lower.
The prospect of a new convention center that competes with and
takes some business from the Civic Plaza is something Phoenix
officials are watching closely.
Cohn noted that the problem for Phoenix officials is not just
what is happening down the road in the East Valley.
He said the size of the Civic Plaza doesn't compare to other
centers in the larger cities, but a look at the whole package shows
downtown amenities from sports arenas to museums within walking
distance and a recent $32-million face lift. Two planned downtown
hotels should help, he said.
But, like Krietor, he said there are other factors to make up
for that disadvantage.
Local convention figures show 50 conventions booked into the
Civic Plaza in fiscal 1997-98, which ends June 30. That would
compare with 43, 49 and 62 in the previous three years.
The city already purchased more than eight acres at the old
Phoenix Union High School campus. One of the reasons: to possibly
use it for expansion of the Civic Plaza.
If 200,000 or 300,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space
were built at the old campus at Seventh Street and Van Buren,
Krietor said the plaza could double-book, hosting some events at
the plaza and some at the nearby campus.
