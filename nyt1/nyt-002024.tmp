After everyone was seated, the show (inspired, of course, by
Casanova) began, and it was worth the wait. Galliano's standouts,
produced for Dior by Stallion Inc., included sheared minks in black
and white inlaid geometric patterns; silk kimono coats with silver
fox collars and cuffs, Poiret-inspired sable day coats lined with
handmade silk roses; pastel-colored chinchilla wraps, and broadtail
lamb wasp-waisted suits. In the new tradition of fur for the
fashion-forward, many were casual and light enough to wear when
chasing fur protesters or paparazzi down the street.
Some of the coats, which Galliano said he designed to reflect
romance, not wealth, were worn over lingerie. As usual with a
Galliano show, half the fun was in the presentation. To show the
coats, models passed through, fanned themselves and flounced about,
taking tipsy, uncertain steps, as if they were in an absinthe
stupor. They didn't seem to be straining for effect. Neither did
the male models who traipsed around caressing both the furs and
women and occasionally licking frosting off their fingers.
