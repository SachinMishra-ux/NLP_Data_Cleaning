Somewhat obscured by the furor over the vetoes was the
Democrats' achievement of some of the things they wanted most this
year, including a large increase in basic school aid, expansion of
the state's health care program for poor children, and a process
for people to appeal when their health insurance companies deny
coverage for certain treatments.
The Assembly passed a criminal-justice package that included the
governor's proposal to end parole, though it also included other
measures that Pataki and the Senate refused to accept. In the end,
no law was enacted, but the Democrats can go home and tell voters
that they, too, voted to abolish parole.
So attractive was that measure as a piece of political cover
that all the Republicans in the Assembly voted for it as well, for
fear that they would be accused of opposing the anti-parole
measure.
Ms. Merritt was born in Emporia, Va., but moved to Philadelphia
while a toddler to be reared by an aunt and uncle after her mother
died. Yearning for a career as an opera singer, she studied at the
Settlement School of Music in Philadelphia, and at Temple
University and New York University.
Later, Ms. Merritt toured as a backup singer for Harry Belafonte
and Jackie Wilson and sang at Carnegie Hall in 1985 as part of the
Kool Jazz Festival and Salute to Cole Porter.
Ms. Merritt is survived by her husband of 52 years, Benjamin
Hines, and by four children, Norman, Benjamin Jr. and Denise, all
of Hollis, and Dennis, of St. Louis.
NEW YORK The city agency that has provided shelter and other
services to tens of thousands of homeless New Yorkers is entering
an era of sharp retrenchment as the Giuliani administration
intensifies its efforts to take the city out of the business of
running shelters.
In the spending plan that begins July 1, the Giuliani
administration will cut 1,000 positions from the Department of
Homeless Services roughly half of its staff over a year. The
changes are part of a broader effort to hand over the task of
running the city's homeless services to the private sector.
And in about three weeks, the city intends to officially stop
using so-called welfare hotels as long-term shelters for homeless
families. This change will end an ambitious effort, begun almost
two decades ago, to shelter all who knocked at the municipal door.
Much larger hotels once bulged with hundreds of poor people and
came to symbolize all that was wrong with the nation's policy on
housing the homeless.
The city will also hand over five more shelters to the private
sector, reducing the number of shelters that it operates to 10 from
15. By the end of the next fiscal year it will run four shelters
for single adults and six for families. It used to operate most of
its 44 shelters for single adults. Most of its 80 shelters for
families have already been turned over to private nonprofit
organizations.
