During her time in hiding, did she ever paint a picture that was
not sad?
When she experienced other difficulties in life, did she turn
from them? How did she behave when her mother was dying of cancer,
five years ago?
Her wish to keep where she lives and works out of the papers?
A Galveston man who allegedly gained entry to a NASA mission
control room and a Navy flight simulator by claiming to be an
astronaut, an ex-CIA agent and a Medal of Honor winner, will be
held for further psychiatric evaluation.
After a hearing Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Calvin Botley
ruled there is probable cause to continue holding Jerry Allen
Whittredge, 49, who was jailed May 30 on a federal criminal
complaint.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Schultz said Thursday that
Whittredge will be sent to a federal medical prison facility, such
as one in Fort Worth, for observation by government psychiatrists.
Botley approved a 30-day detention that could be extended for
15-day intervals if doctors need the extra time, Schultz said.
Whittredge is accused of lying to federal agents on several
occasions, punishable on conviction by five years in prison per
count, and of impersonating a federal employee, punishable by three
years per count. Each offense also carries a fine of up to
$250,000.
Although the government normally has 30 days after arrest to
obtain a grand jury indictment, the clock stopped after about two
weeks so that Whittredge's mental state could be evaluated, Schultz
said.
Described by high school classmates in Port Arthur as a talented
orator with an interest in science, Whittredge allegedly talked his
way into a flight simulator at the Naval Air Station at Kingsville
and into NASA's mission control room in Huntsville, Ala.
