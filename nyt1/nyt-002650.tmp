This raised another sobering issue: the Bulls' ability to
control Stockton's dribble penetration with their long-limbed
defenders. Stockton is not as quick as he used to be, and this
becomes much more noticeable against a defensive-minded Eastern
Conference team than it does against anyone out West.
Over the last six minutes of the second quarter, the Jazz's
offense devolved into the Knicks'. Malone, quiet after Dennis
Rodman relieved Longley, ran over Scottie Pippen on the break.
Bryon Russell turned a simple and uncontested inbounds pass to
Stockton into a backcourt violation. Stockton lost the ball deep in
the lane. Malone traveled in the post, then threw up an air ball in
the lane.
Get the picture? The Bulls did. Jordan and Toni Kukoc
immediately began abusing their men off the dribble. When Kukoc
penetrates the way he did Sunday night, forget it, Chicago's
sportswriters may as well begin the campaign to keep this group
together until 2010. Jordan and the 6-foot-11-inch Kukoc in the
lane with the ball are a different story than the frail Hornacek
and Stockton.
How bad did it get for Malone and Utah? He was called twice by
Hue Hollins for charging on the break against Hollins' favorite
player, Pippen. The Bulls cruised into halftime with a 49-31 lead,
by far the largest lead in the series. The second half, from the
shellshocked perception of Jerry Sloan, bordered on disgrace.
Uncontested Chicago dunks. Jordan and Pippen resting on the bench
with impish smiles that gave way to raucous laughter.
The Bulls were cruising, pulling ahead in the finals in the
backstretch. This is a team that has never been caught from behind.
NEW YORK She has been haunted by many things these last few
days. The image of a woman pleading for her life, so that her five
children would not be left motherless. The photograph of a man
twisted under a bar stool, unsuccessfully trying to shield himself
from a robber's bullet. The smirk on the lips of Darrel K. Harris
as witnesses identified him as the killer of three people at a
Brooklyn social club Club Happiness.
And there was another picture, a snapshot from the life of the
49-year-old woman, a juror in Harris' trial, who spoke briefly and
reluctantly Sunday on the condition that her name not be used.
She recalled a time when she had been sick, near death, and
terrified of leaving her teen-age son behind. So she put herself in
the shoes of the woman, Evelyn Davis, who had begged Harris not to
kill her. He stabbed her in the back, because he had used up his
bullets.
The juror said that when she began deliberating Harris' fate
four days ago, more than half the panel of five men and seven women
in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn herself included opposed
sentencing him to death.
But on Saturday morning, after turning to her Bible and praying
to her God, the juror added her voice to those who decided that
Harris should die by lethal injection. If carried out, it will be
the first execution in New York State since 1963.
