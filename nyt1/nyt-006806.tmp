So the strongman played the round with a 3-wood instead of his
driver. He stayed within the fairways and within himself. He didn't
crack under the weight of three bogeys on the front nine. He
gathered himself to shoot 32 on the back nine. Just as he didn't
crack back in March when he posted an 18 on one hole at The Players
Championship.
Daly's 69 was his lowest first-round score in nine trips to the
the Open, and he finds himself right in the hunt. Which is only

The deal which probably will involve the issuance of
Cornerstone securities to Wilson's owners is expected to be
sealed over the weekend and officially announced early next week.
The lion's share of the proceeds will go to principal owner and
founder Bill Wilson, a Stanford graduate whose real-estate
associates have included the Rockefeller family, Yale University,
pension funds and various private partnerships.
It owns more than 11 million square feet of office space
throughout California, including substantial holdings in San
Francisco and on the Peninsula. It also has properties in the
Pacific Northwest.
The firm built the architecturally striking Oracle Corp.
headquarters complex in Redwood Shores and owns a building occupied
by Gap Inc. in San Mateo. It also owns San Mateo's Borel Office
Center, a multitenant, four-building complex.
Last year, it bought the Equitable Life Building at 120
Montgomery St. in San Francisco in a deal reportedly worth $70 million.
Wilson and Cornerstone which also owns about 11 million square
feet of office space combined with Gap Chairman Donald Fisher
this year in an unsuccessful bid for San Francisco's 3.76
million-square-foot Embarcadero Center.
Sources said Cornerstone, which specializes in office properties
in prime metropolitan areas, views Wilson as a more-than-acceptable
consolation prize in its effort to establish a major foothold in
the booming Bay Area office market.
For Bill Wilson, now is the ideal time to sell, says James F.
Wilson (no relation), an analyst with Jefferies Co. in San
Francisco.
