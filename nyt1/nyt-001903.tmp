Ken Griffey Jr. supplied the only response during the game, a
two-run homer in the first inning. Afterward, it was clear the
center fielder is not being paid by the syllable.
Cecil Fielder is usually spotted launching majestic home runs.
In the Angels clubhouse, he was holding a victory brew and perhaps
a few answers for the Mariners.
The slugger knows what the Mariners are going through. He played
for the Detroit Tigers, a high-scoring team with a pitching staff
that could not shut anyone down.
Fielder also believes the Mariners might be struggling because
of all the trade rumors revolving around Randy Johnson. Like many
others, he doesn't get it.
The Mariners went in front 2-0 in the first inning after Griffey
smacked a two-run homer off the facing of the second deck in right
field. Griffey entered the game with just one hit off Angels
starter Ken Hill in 15 career at-bats.
Griffey broke ahead of teammate Alex Rodriguez in their American
League home-run battle, Junior stroking his 22nd while the Mariner
shortstop remained at 21 after going 0-for-3. Griffey tied
Colorado's Vinny Castilla for second in the major league home-run
race. They both trail Mark McGwire, who has 27.
Ahead 4-2, the Angels added another run in the eighth amid
Kingdome silence that was interrupted only by occasional boos from
some disgruntled customers among the gathering of 23,709.
And, yes, the boos were directed at two ineffective Mariner
relievers, Greg McCarthy and Mike Timlin. McCarthy, the left-hander
who was just called up from Tacoma Wednesday, received a hostile
welcome after walking three of the five batters he faced. Timlin
was doused after allowing a run-scoring single to DiSarcina.
A fitting accessory to a Mariner loss showed up in the ninth
inning. Bobby Ayala is the reliever with an 0-5 record who allowed
a game-winning two-run homer in his last appearance Tuesday in
Baltimore. Thursday night he gave up one more run as the mood
turned somber and fans turned toward the stairs and the parking
lot.
The Mariners blew a chance to pick up ground on AL West-leading
Texas but moved within one game of last-place Oakland.
