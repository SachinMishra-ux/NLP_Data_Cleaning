Irvin had the finest season of his career in 1995 when he caught
111 passes for 1,603 yards and 11 touchdowns. He followed that up
with 64 catches for 962 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games in
1996 and 75 catches for 1,180 yards and nine touchdowns in 1997.
That Irvin wants to play is certainly embodied by his unyielding
intensity and unmatched work ethic that teammates say has energized
the locker room.
Gailey fully understands that any distractions could have
negatively impacted the implementation of his new offense and
potentially sabotaged his inaugural season. But Gailey said he is
not surprised by Irvin's positive influence; he expected nothing
different.
Irvin credits much of his enthusiasm to the new coaching staff
and Gailey's new offense, which will feature Irvin lining up in the
backfield and at slot receiver in addition to his regular outside
receiver position.
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, cautiously appreciative for what so
far has been an off-season free of incidence from any of his
players, agrees.
Jones says what can be said of Irvin can be said of the team on
and off the field. He believes the changed Cowboys will result in
regaining some past glory in 1998.
CHICAGO Watch them closely the rest of this week, because it
might be over before Saturday.
Chicago's march toward a third straight title, and a sixth of
this decade (is there any doubt it would be eight straight if not
for Michael Jordan's baseball flirtation?), took a dramatic step
forward Sunday night at the United Center when the Bulls dismantled
the Utah Jazz, 96-54, to take a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals.
That's right, folks. 96-54. Utah set a record for Finals
futility, shattering the previous low score of 71 (last done by
Houston against the Celtics in 1981). It was the worst beating in
the history of the NBA Finals, surpassing Washington's 35-point
drubbing of the Sonics in 1978. Utah's point total was the lowest
in the history of the post-shot-clock NBA.
Perhaps the Jazz can rally like the Celtics did in 1984, winning
three of the last four after getting humiliated in Games 1 and 3.
