But this latest crop, as well as some that will be available
later this year, make good on the original promise. Video card
chipsets such as Intel Corp.'s i740 and the current 3-D champion,
3Dfx Interactive's Voodoo2, make it possible for designers and
artists to fulfill almost any vision they have.
The ability to do realistic graphics is having a major impact on
game design. The best example I saw was the latest version of
Sierra Online's popular adventure game series, King's Quest.
Subtitled Mask of Eternity, it abandons the series' previous visual
style of Disney-like cartoon characters in favor of a realistic,
3-D design. Sierra's artists and legendary game designer Roberta
Williams are comfortable enough with the quality of this look to
have it become a part of one of the company's franchise titles.
Games such as Ion Storm's Daikatana created by John Romero,
the id Software co-founder who was responsible for the game design
in Doom and Quake Sierra's Half-Life and GT Interactive's Unreal
show what happens when incredibly talented artists are turned loose
with a technology that has almost no visual boundaries. The worlds
these people are creating constitute a new art form, a kind of
living comic book.
 Stories are becoming more important. While adventure games
have always relied on plot and characters to draw players into
their worlds, action and strategy games have not. In the past, this
genre has been typified by the kill-it-if-it-moves philosophy of
game play.
In Half-Life, for example, one of the creatures you confront is
blind, but has excellent hearing. All you see of the monster is a
set of huge, clawed tentacles that feel their way around the room.
If you run in firing, you're toast the thing will pin you with
its claws. The game also has other, computer-controlled humans who
will give you vital information. If you kill them or let a
monster take them down you may miss something vital.
 Every game is multiplayer, but who's playing? Game developers
and publishers continue to be frustrated by their seeming inability
to make money with online, multiplayer games. The head of
Electronic Arts complained during an executive forum at E3 that the
company's Ultima Online an online-only, role-playing game that
can host thousands of players at once brought in just $150,000
but cost $10 million to develop and maintain.
Publishers and analysts say the problem is that consumers see
online PC gaming as a cumbersome process many people who own
games with online components don't utilize them because they're
intimidated by trying to get them to work. Others complain that
there's so much free online play available such as games like
Quake and Quake II, in which anyone with a PC and a fast Net
connection can host a multiplayer game that people are reluctant
to pay for the same experience.
 Tradition is not dead. Developers have discovered that
mainstream computer users are most comfortable with traditional
titles they know from classic games. Hasbro Interactive, which was
a nonentity in the game community just 18 months ago, has become a
major force by reviving familiar names such as Monopoly, Boggle,
Scrabble and Yahtzee.
Other publishers are following suit, and also are mining video
game nostalgia. One title drawing a lot of interest was a 3-D
version of Pac-Man, the 1980s icon. Would I sound too much like a
digital fuddy if I admitted I liked the original version a lot
better?
