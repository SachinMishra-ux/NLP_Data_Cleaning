What Duval has done is tantalize us with the possibilities of
returning golf to its heyday a stage for two heavyweights to
separate themselves from the PGA Tour masses on a regular basis and
clearly divide the galleries. Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus did
this. So did Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan. Match play.
The '80s had no such arrangement, nor have the '90s so far,
forcing golf followers to settle for man against the game, the
course or the elements. Which is not nearly as much fun.
Woods, 23, and Duval have the shots to get this done and slip
away from the rest of golf's enormously talented 20-something
players, a group that includes Justin Leonard, Ernie Els, Phil
Mickelson and Jim Furyk. Since last year's U.S. Open, Woods and
Duval have played in 14 tournaments together. Head to head, they
are 7-7. In majors, they are 2-2. In 13{ events together (Duval
missed one cut), four strokes separate them, in Duval's favor.
Woods carries an edge in length, averaging seven more yards per
drive (295.6) than Duval in 1998. Yet Duval leads the tour in
putting (1.705 per hole) and birdies (4.61 per round) this season.
With the exception of a green jacket and he had an arm in one
sleeve last April before finishing second to Mark O'Meara Duval
has done it all. He just hasn't let you know it. There have been no
leg-splitting, fist-pumping gyrations, no commercials, few magazine
covers.
Duval chooses to go about his work without the sideshow. This
seems to satisfy him. This seems to be his only drawback in the
public's mind. But that's OK. Nicklaus, when initially compared to
the swash-buckling Palmer, was said to be about as dull as watching
a fairway being mowed. Duval suffers from a similar perception.
Woods had his normal circus-like following Tuesday during a
morning practice round at Olympic, while Duval had far fewer fans
watching him prepare. It's human nature.
Some players remain just as adamant as the fans over the game's
top player. Five recent wins make no difference to them either.
Woods' smugness and confidence seem to greatly overshadow the
workmanlike Duval. And it starts at home.
Maybe Duval was effectively humbled before he could think of
getting a big head. A four-time All-American at Georgia Tech and
1993 college player of the year, he failed to earn his tour card
and spent the '93 and '94 seasons on the Nike Tour. Once on the big
tour, he suffered through the indignation of several near-misses,
finishing as a tournament runner-up seven times before his
breakthrough.
