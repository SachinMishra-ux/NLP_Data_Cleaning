The rules even apply before the game. That's why, even though
the game still was a couple of hours away, Levine asked Wetteland
if he wanted a cup of coffee, and why Wetteland was so polite in
accepting.
If the players didn't like each other, off the field it could
turn into resentment and animosity.
CLEVELAND Joe Torre will be an American League coach at next
month's all-star game in Colorado, at the request of Mike Hargrove,
Cleveland's manager. But it may be that only a couple of Yankees
players join him, in spite of the team's staggering success the
first half of this season.
No Yankee player is leading at his respective position in the
balloting of fans, although Derek Jeter has a chance to overtake
Alex Rodriguez among the shortstops. That would mean the Yankees'
representatives would have to be chosen with an at-large bid,
leaving them at the mercy of an imperfect system for selection.
Bernie Williams would have been a strong candidate to be picked,
but it may be that he won't be able to play again until after the
all-star game break. Paul O'Neill has hit well, and yet he doesn't
have the gaudy power numbers.
Chuck Knoblauch is among the league leaders in runs scored, but
he's hitting .273 and other second basemen, like Damion Easley of
Detroit, have much greater production. Jeter was the Yankees' best
player in the first two months but missed 15 days with an injury,
and Hargrove seems to be leaning to including his own shortstop,
Omar Vizquel, on the American League squad; that may or may not
leave room for a third shortstop, like Jeter.
David Cone has nine victories and is averaging more than a
strikeout an inning, but his earned run average of 4.82 will hurt
his chances. David Wells is 8-2 and pitched a perfect game; he,
too, has a relatively high ERA (4.47) among all-star candidates.
Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' closer, has permitted just one walk in
20 appearances and has a 1.11 ERA, but because of an early-season
injury and the Yankees' extraordinary offense, four other AL
relievers have more saves than he. (Hargrove may give him extra
consideration because he regretted not picking Rivera in 1996, when
Rivera was a dominant middle reliever.)
Hideki Irabu appears to be the Yankees' best pitching candidate,
bearing a league-best 1.68 ERA, and opponents have batted just .191
against him, also the best in the AL. Working against Irabu will be
his modest victory total of six (12 pitchers have eight or more
victories). Irabu will have a chance to make a case for selection
Sunday, when he pitches here against the Indians and Hargrove.
Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third baseman, may have the best
chance among the position players to be chosen. Cal Ripken Jr. of
Baltimore will be voted as the all-star starter at third base, but
Brosius is having perhaps the finest season of any American League
third baseman. Going into Saturday's game, Brosius was batting
.317, with 40 runs scored and 46 runs batted in, and he has
received increased recognition for his defense.
Hargrove asked Torre to be his coach in 1996, but Torre declined
for family considerations. Later that season, Hargrove sent Torre
notes, telling him he was praying for his brother Frank, who
eventually needed a heart transplant.
