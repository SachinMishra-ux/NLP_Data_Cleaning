It all sounds like fun older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good. THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE 
Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
