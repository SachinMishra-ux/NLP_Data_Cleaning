One company that expects to move to the test site within the
next two years is Kistler Aerospace, which is planning to launch
satellites from the base on the world's first fully reusable
rocket. Launches require restricted airspace and dozens of square
miles of flat open land for the rockets to return if all goes
well using a parachute and airbags.
The company anticipates building a launch pad and several
buildings for flight control and assembly, representing a $45
million investment. Robert Wang, chairman of Kistler Aerospace,
said that his company was attracted by the availability of
utilities (unlike remote sites elsewhere) and equipment and the
potential of hiring part-time skilled personnel.
Other businesses expressing interest in signing on for one of
the various vacant buildings or at an industrial park planned
around the base airport include a company that recycles carbon, a
liquid-oxygen manufacturer and a company that is developing
hydrogen enriched natural gas for cars. One firm that is
considering building a solar power plant on the test site is now
negotiating with potential customers.
Businesses that move into the test site must still get state
licensing and follow environmental laws, which are generally less
restrictive in isolated locations. They must also get approval from
a board, which weighs such factors as the impact of the business on
national security, safety, interference with a neighboring Air
Force base and the creation of high technology jobs that could go
to laid-off test site workers.
That eliminates tennis-shoe manufacturers, for example,
according to Richard Betteridge, an Energy Department official who
is working to bring new activities to the test site. Even in the
unlikely event that such a business would want to be so far from a
city where workers could live, its presence at the test site would
not benefit the government's mission to create skilled jobs and
diversify southern Nevada's growing, but still casino-dependent,
economy, he said.
Among the market offerings are some for only temporary use, such
as an existing hazardous chemical spill center, which companies
like DuPont could lease for a few weeks to conduct safety drills.
And officials at the test site are also trying to attract more
government work, perhaps an antiterrorism center where engineers
would blow up mock buildings to learn how to build with more
durable materials. Universities are welcome to use the test site
for research, an Energy Department said.
But much of the test site will probably never be considered for
commerce. Parts of the base are reserved for secret military
projects, future nuclear detonations and an underground
nuclear-waste depository called Yucca Mountain, which is scheduled
to open in the next century. In addition, there are occasional
nuclear experiments not involving a chain reaction, crater fields,
and a small portion of land contaminated by radiation.
Commercial development is a profound transformation for the test
site, which has been the nation's primary venue for nuclear weapons
testing since 1951. Over the years, 928 nuclear devices have been
detonated, at first in the atmosphere, then deep underground after
the harmful effects of radiation became better known.
The work stoked the economy in the neighboring rural counties
and gave life to Mercury, the restricted government town on the
test site at which hundreds of scientists once spent the night in
dormitories. After the Cold War ended and much of the staff left,
the town's movie theater and bowling alley were closed.
If nuclear tests resume, the Energy Department says new
companies at the test site will not be thrown out nor be
contaminated by fallout. But some may be kept from their facilities
as a precaution for, at most, a few days when tests are scheduled.
