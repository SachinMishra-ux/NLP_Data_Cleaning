Among the ashrams particularly popular with Americans is one
outside Bombay in Ganeshpuri founded by Swami Muktananda, who was
influential among the Eastern teachers who came to the United
States in the 1960s and '70s. The ashram is now run by Gurumayi
Chidvilasananda, known to her followers simply as Gurumayi.
Her affiliated ashram in South Fallsburg, N.Y., the SYDA
Foundation (the acronym stands for Siddha Yoga Dham of America),
has attracted Meg Ryan, the hair stylist John Frieda and the
Manhattan socialite Mica Ertegun. Gurumayi's high profile is
further insured by the encouragement of visitors to her ashram to
carry her beatific portrait; it comes in a handy wallet size.
Anne Dexter Jones, the style editor of Hamptons Country
magazine, who is married to Mick Jones of the '70s rock band
Foreigner, said that she had noticed her own interest in the ashram
experience, and in India, picking up recently.
Jessica Tuck, a Los Angeles actress, is planning her first visit
to an ashram. She studies meditation at the Los Angeles Baba
Center, which is named for Sai Baba, and is planning to go to Sai
Baba's ashram in November.
Ms. Pressman meditates twice a day. She says she is in good
health. Her peaches-and-cream complexion puts peaches and cream to
shame. She has given up eating meat, smoking cigarettes and
drinking coffee. Barneys is planning to introduce the opulent,
Indian-inspired design collection of Colette Dinnigan in the fall,
and the photographs of runway models in bolts of bright fabric
littered Ms. Pressman's Yugo-size desk.
