WASHINGTON The chairman of a House immigration panel said
Friday he would hold a hearing next month into the shooting death
of a young Texan by a Marine anti-drug patrol.
The shooting near the Rio Grande River last year prompted the
Defense Department to temporarily suspend the use of soldiers in
counter-narcotics surveillance operations along the U.S.-Mexico
border.
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, voiced frustration at the slow
response from the Justice and Defense departments on his requests
for information and documents about the death on May 20, 1997, of
Esequiel Hernandez, 18.
Smith wants transcripts of radio conversations among the
Marines, Border Patrol and other federal agencies when the four-man
patrol was given the order to shoot Hernandez. The Marines were
working in conjunction with the Border Patrol at the time of the
shooting.
Smith also is asking for records on training and supervision of
armed military patrols that served on anti-drug patrols along the
border.
State and federal grand juries that investigated the shooting
did not indict Marine Cpl. Clemente Banuelos, who admitted to
shooting Hernandez with an M-16 rifle after the civilian fired his
.22-caliber rifle at the four camouflaged Marines.
The shooting occurred at dusk, several miles from the Rio Grande
and near the border town of Redford, in a rugged border corridor
that attracts smugglers. Hernandez was herding his family's goats
at the time of the shooting, and family members have said he
normally carried a gun for protection.
The immigration subcommittee has subpoenaed documents presented
to the grand juries, as well as policy directives and position
statements from the Justice and Defense departments.
The congressman agreed to push back a Friday deadline for the
information from the Defense Department after Navy Secretary John
Dalton pledged full cooperation with the lawmaker's investigation.
Smith also accused the Justice Department of failing to produce
documents sought by the committee for months.
