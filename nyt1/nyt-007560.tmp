Iran's top three stars strikers Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi
and midfielder Karim Bagheri all play for clubs in Germany's
Bundesliga. They supply the punch in Talebi's counterattacking
3-5-2 system, which allows them to free-lance.
If the Americans are too careless going forward, the Iranians
will sting them on the counter. But after scoring in only one of
its last four matches, the US can't afford to worry about getting
caught upfield. Timidity in the World Cup gets you an early ticket
home.
Iran hasn't played in the Cup since 1978 and doesn't expect to
win a match here. The Americans, who reached the second round last
time, have beaten the Brazilians this year. The Iranians, who are
on their fourth coach since November, lost, 7-1, to AS Roma last
month.
If the Americans defeat Iran by two goals and Germany does the
same to Yugoslavia, the US can advance by tying the Yugoslavs in
Nantes on Thursday. But the goal-differential arithmetic can wait
SAN FRANCISCO This time, Tom Lehman does not have to carry the
burden of the lead into the final round of the U.S. Open. That
weight belongs to Payne Stewart.
Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson took the lead into the
final round in 1955, '66 and '87, respectively. No one came out
alive. Palmer blew a 7-shot lead over the last nine holes, then an
18-hole playoff to Billy Casper the next day.
But Stewart has a bit of history working for him, too. His
4-shot lead is the largest since Tony Jacklin led the 1970 Open at
Hazeltine near Minneapolis. And Jacklin ended up winning by 7
shots.
Without question, Stewart said, he would sooner be out front
than trying to catch up. History doesn't bother him one bit.
Saturday was a tough day to play golf, as only three of the
remaining 60 players broke par. When the last ball had floated
through the ocean breeze and quit rolling on the hard, tight
fairways, only Stewart was under par for 54 holes.
Stewart, who has only one victory since his '91 Open win (1995
Houston Open), got his day off to a fast start, running in an eagle
at the first hole from 18 feet. There also was a spectacular 7-iron
at No. 8 that settled within tap-in range for another birdie. Even
though he made three bogeys, there were big saves at the 17th and
18th holes.
