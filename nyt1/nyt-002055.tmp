Another measure of both funds' high risk levels can be found in
the concentration of fund holdings. As of April, Premier Aggressive
Growth held 70 stocks; each of the top six holdings accounted for
between 4 percent and 7 percent of the fund's assets.
Aggressive Growth was even more concentrated, at 54 stocks. Its
No. 1 holding, a cosmetics and medical technology concern called
Chromatics Color Science International, accounted for almost 13
percent of the fund's assets. That's staggering, given that a top
holding in a fund typically accounts for 2 percent to 3 percent of
assets.
Dreyfus is making a big bet on Chromatics Color Science, a
company that was brought public in 1993 by Investors Associates, a
brokerage firm that closed last year after a number of state
securities regulators revoked its license. Chromatics Color Science
trades around $11.50, down from $17.25 in March. Dreyfus owned 1.5
million shares as of March, more than 10 percent of the company's
shares outstanding.
The bet on Chromatics is not the only big gamble fund holders
have made. Almost 30 percent of the assets in Premier Aggressive
Growth are stocks of obscure companies in which Dreyfus owns more
than 5 percent of the shares outstanding. In the Aggressive Growth
fund, 67 percent of the assets are stocks of companies in which
Dreyfus owns more than 5 percent of shares.
This concentration in illiquid stocks is fine when the fund
manager is buying. As the buying wave rises, so does the stock's
price. This in turn raises the fund's net asset value, making the
bet look smart.
But when the buying dries up, trouble begins. If the stock does
not have positive earnings or other good news to support it, the
price begins to flag. The bigger the position, the harder it is to
get out. Which is precisely the predicament that LaRocco finds
himself in at Dreyfus.
Of course, if the funds sell many stocks at a loss, any gains
going forward under their new manager may be offset. That is the
only silver lining to the liquidity cloud hanging over these mutual
funds.
Q. I plan to put a Pergo floor, the laminated plastic, in my
kitchen, but I am concerned as to what the table and chairs will do
to it, such as scratching. And, is a Pergo floor too slippery when
wet?
A. While the Pergo is guaranteed for 15 years (not long for a
floor), any floor surface except a rug will be scratched, or at
least is likely to be scratched by a moving chair, especially if
one tiny grain of sand gets between leg and floor. And that goes
for Pergo, varnished wood, linoleum, sheet vinyl, resilient tile,
and ceramic tile. Of course, some, such as glazed tile, are more
resistant to scratching than others.
But there is hope: Put a glide at the ends of the table and
chair legs. It can be felt, which works well but wears out quickly,
but better is a nylon glide that can be nailed into the ends of
legs. A more permanent cure is to put area rugs under tables and
chairs. Simple, but logical.
