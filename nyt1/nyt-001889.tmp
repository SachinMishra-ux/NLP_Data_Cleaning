The near-collision had not been previously disclosed, in part
because information about it was not forwarded properly for
investigation and agency officials therefore did not learn about it
until several weeks later, the FAA said. Agency officials said a
controller at the La Guardia air traffic tower had promptly
informed his supervisor, but the supervisor did not properly report
it to his superiors.
The US Airways pilot did report the incident after he returned
to his base in Pittsburgh, but that report, too, was mishandled,
the agency said.
Brenner said that his office had received inquiries about the
incident in early April from The New York Times, The Washington
Post and CBS News. But after checking records and finding no
mention of a near-collision or a so-called operational error when
a controller's mistake puts two planes in close proximity he told
those organizations that there had been no problem. News of the
retraining was first reported in Friday morning's editions of The
Washington Post.
Brenner said on Thursday night that the incident occurred about
9:30 a.m. on April 3, when the winds were low and La Guardia was
using two intersecting runways. The Air Canada flight was departing
to the northwest and the US Airways flight was approaching on a
southwest heading.
According to the FAA, the go-around order was proper but came
late. But the FAA still has not cited the controller who gave the
order, and has not ascribed an error to anyone else. The FAA is
continue to investigate, as is the National Transportation Safety
Board.
The executive vice president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, Randy Schwitz, said that the FAA had come
to his union and said it wanted to order two hours of additional
training for all controllers in airport towers around the country.
The FAA said the reason was to reduce incidents at airports, but
the agency did not tie it to the event at La Guardia, he said.
The retraining plan does not include controllers at air route
traffic control centers, which handle mostly high-altitude,
long-distance airliners, or at the terminal radar approach
controls, which handle planes as they descend to airports or climb
away from them.
Priscille LeBlanc, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, had no specific
information about a near-collision on April 3 at La Guardia
Airport. She did recall receiving a query from a newspaper around
that time about a near-miss incident, but couldn't say for certain
whether that was the same incident.
Sharon Taylor, a spokeswoman for US Airways, said that she did
not have any information on such an incident.
