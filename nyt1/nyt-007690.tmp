After Janzen made par at No. 18, he had to wait for Stewart, who
made par at 17 and then fell short at 18. But for Janzen, the wait
was worth it. He had not won on the PGA Tour since 1995, and he had
moments when he doubted himself.
TOKYO Just two days before President Clinton departs for
China, financial markets in Asia reacted cautiously to political
and diplomatic efforts over the weekend to stabilize Asia's
currencies, in particular the Japanese yen.
The yen dipped modestly in value against the dollar in early
Tokyo trading Monday, as currency traders showed some
disappointment that Japan offered only promises, but no specific
measures, to revive its severely weakened economy.
The Japanese currency weakened to 137.35 to the dollar, from
136.10 yen in New York on Friday, erasing just a bit of the gains
brought about by the intervention of the United States and Japan
last week. Before the intervention, the yen had reached 144 to the
dollar.
Japanese stocks were also stable, with the Nikkei index of 225
issues up 12.34, to 15,280.32, at midmorning.
Traders were wary in selling off the yen because of fears that
the United States and Japan will intervene in the currency markets
again, as they did on Wednesday, to prop up the Japanese currency.
They also seem to be concerned about being on the wrong side of a
bet if Japan does take steps to strengthen its economy and the yen.
At a hastily called meeting Saturday of delegates from the Group
of Seven industrialized nations and 10 Asian nations, Japan
reitererated its commitment to clean up the nation's bad banking
loans and to take steps to revive its economy. But despite
expectations, Japan offered no new or concrete plans.
In what appeared to be an attempt to fend off an attack on the
yen, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto held an emergency meeting
Monday morning on the nation's bad banking loans with Koichi Kato,
the secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
The meeting came as newspapers reported that a large Japanese bank,
the Long-Term Credit Bank, which is saddled with billions of
dollars in bad loans, was desperately looking for a rescue merger
to escape collapse.
A further rapid decline of the yen would threaten financial
stability in Asia and could escalate the economic turmoil in the
region to a new level, particularly if China moved to devalue its
currency.
Asian leaders have been unnerved by the prospect of China
devaluing its currency. A devaluation by China could lead to a
round of devaluations around the region, as other countries aim to
cheapen their exports, which have been a main source of recovery in
Asia.
