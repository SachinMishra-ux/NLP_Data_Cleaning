Since 1983, when they sold their stock for $1.1 billion, Bill
and Frederick have been battling Charles and David. Soon after the
sale, Bill claimed that Charles and David hid information about the
company to devalue the stock.
Bill shook his head once when he read the jury's verdict form.
He was the only brother in Topeka for the verdict.
Bill Koch, vowing an appeal, continued to attack the company and
his brothers. He said his case was crippled by the judge's
restrictions on what claims his lawyers could make and how they
could cross-examine Charles and David.
Bill Koch compared his legal battle to the sailing competitions
that led to his taking the America's Cup.
But jurors, who deliberated over two days, said the evidence was
not difficult to sort through because they had heard it repeatedly.
Jurors also got an earful of family gossip, but insisted it
played no part of their deliberations. For instance, they heard
about a terrible argument at a Christmas dinner in which Bill
allegedly blamed his mother for all his problems. They heard about
how one cousin, 89-year-old Howard Marshall II, married 26-year-old
Playboy centerfold Anna Nicole Smith.
The Koch name will continue to be dissected in court. Bill Koch
is suing the company on allegations Koch Industries stole oil from
American Indians. That case will go to trial next year.
Rosser pointed out that the lawsuits are two of 10 that Bill
Koch has filed against Charles and David Koch and the company.
UNDATED Khakis. They were once considered classic, classy,
preppy and, well, more than a little boring. They have long been
what men with traditional fashion tastes wore sometimes too short with blue blazers. Ditto for women in loafers with baby
strollers.
But khakis began to take on a glossier, hipper image a few years
ago. Designer Karl Lagerfeld, in his unique talent for sweeping up
street fashion, did khakis for Chanel in the mid '90s. Then there
was Seinfeld's buddy George bumbling about in Dockers' khakis. They
became the acceptable fallback for business casual when people
didn't know what to wear.
