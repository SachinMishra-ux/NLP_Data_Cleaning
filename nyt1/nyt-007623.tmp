with rocks and branches, that meanders out of the village.
The United States, in an effort to stay the hand of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, has threatened NATO intervention
unless the soldiers are withdrawn from the province and
negotiations with a moderate ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are resumed.
It increasingly appears, however, that Milosevic is biding his
time until he sees an opportune moment to strike to wipe out the
rebellion. That moment may not be far away, given the bickering
within NATO over what to do in Kosovo with some nations, but not
the United States, saying that intervention requires U.N.
authorization.
But a push to wipe out the rebel zones would be likely to force
the insurgents to move into the hills, to build smaller, more
fluid, bands and to widen the scope of the war perhaps bringing
it into Pristina. It would also create scores of new martyrs, the
fuse that ignited the current rebellion.
It was the earlier crackdown on the ethnic Albanian separatists
that led hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of ethnic Albanians who
had left Kosovo seeking new opportunities to quit their jobs in
Germany and Switzerland over the past several weeks and to travel
to northern Albania to join the rebel movement. Any prolonged war
also has the danger of drawing Albania, already a staging area and
sanctuary for the rebels, and Macedonia, which also has a restive
ethnic Albanian minority, into the conflict.
In Junik, Maloku, an architect wearing a green ammunitions pouch
strapped over his sweater and carrying an AK-47 assault rifle,
stood with a half dozen of his neighbors under the peaked barn roof
with its dark oak beams. The tractors, wooden rakes, buckets, empty
animal stalls and faint scent of machine oil gave to the cool
interior a sense of bucolic peace that helped soften the signs of
brutality outside. On the stucco walls of the house that faces the
barn are splotch marks from shrapnel explosions and drill-like
holes from sniper bullets.
The red tiled roofs of a housing complex, now being used as a
Yugoslav government military base, are visible through the canopy
of trees less than half a mile away.
The base was being reinforced Saturday with 120 special police
in blue helmets and flak jackets. The police were arriving crouched
down in the back of flatbed trucks with heavy metal plating on the
sides. The rust-colored plates with rectangular gun slits, were
apparently welded onto the trucks to protect the police from
ambushes by the guerrillas who control swathes of territory in the
border region with Albania and who have held Junik for three weeks.
Gani Shehu, 31, a stocky lawyer, is the president of the local
Democratic League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian party in Kosovo
led by the Rugova, who advocates peaceful change. Shehu spoke about
the conflict Saturday as he sat in his living room. A neighbor
whose mother had been killed by a Serb shell squatted over a small,
blue propane burner heating Turkish coffee in a small red metal
pitcher.
Shehu spoke about the attack on May 29, when Serb forces dropped
grenades and mortars on Junik for 12 hours, sending the 12,000
villagers along with 6,000 people there who had been driven out
of neighboring villages fleeing into the woods. A half dozen
people were killed and scores were injured.
