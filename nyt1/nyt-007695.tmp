The association, which represents five manufacturers of personal
watercraft, plans to file suit in a federal court asking that the
ordinance be repealed, Ms. Mathews said. She would not disclose the
terms of the complaint.
Some areas, like Duck Key, have asked to have their waters
included in the ordinance, and the County Commission will review
those requests next month.
The state of Florida has already banned personal watercraft in
several areas, including the Everglades, but similar restrictions
in the tourist-dependent Keys have met strong opposition. The
islands have 65,000 permanent residents but about 3 million
tourists each year. The recent vote followed two years of studies
and heated debate that pitted some who favored a ban on the
watercraft against industry representatives who opposed curbs.
One in every three new boats sold in the country is a personal
watercraft, the Boat Owners Association of the United States said.
Last year, more than 36 percent of recreational boating accidents
in Florida involved personal watercraft, compared with less than 15
percent in 1990, according to the Florida Marine Patrol.
Industry representatives in the Keys have said that personal
watercraft should face the same rules as other watercraft rather
than being singled out. They have maintained that education is the
best way to ensure that such watercraft are used in a safe and less
obtrusive way.
Ms. Mathews, the industry representative, said manufacturers
would begin next year to produce lines of vehicles that make about
50 percent less noise. But, she added, personal watercraft already
meet federal and state sound regulations.
Mayor Jack London of Monroe County, which comprises the Keys,
said the new ordinance might be extended to compel businesses that
rent personal watercraft to require that customers demonstrate
experience.
Among those applauding any restrictions on personal watercraft
are the local fishermen, whose prey redfish, bonefish and tarpon are frightened from their grasp every time a personal watercraft
turns the still, shallow sea-grass flats where they dwell into the
equivalent of a hurricane.
The trick is to hook computers together over existing phone
wires so family members can surf the Web together, share printers
or shoot one another in computer game competitions.
The Home Phoneline Networking Alliance enjoys support from such
giants as Advanced Micro Devices, ATT, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM and Intel Corp. It promises to get inexpensive home networking
technology into stores by the fourth quarter of 1998 in time for
holiday shopping sprees.
