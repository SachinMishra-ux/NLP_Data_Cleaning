A slight tear in Dafoe's left shoulder capsule was repaired
early Thursday morning by Dr. Ron Kvitne, and Dafoe is expected to
need up to 12 weeks to recover.
Rob Tallas spent most of last season as Dafoe's backup after Jim
Carey was demoted to Providence and soon thereafter required
season-ending shoulder surgery. The untested John Grahame, son of
former Boston netminder Ron Grahame, ranks third or fourth on the
netminding depth chart, depending on whether the out-of-favor Carey
is considered a viable option to play here again.
Dafoe and Tallas almost certainly would be the two netminders
protected. Grahame is exempt, having turned pro a year ago. Carey,
owed $5 million over the next two seasons, likely wouldn't interest
the Predators, whose boss is David Poile, the former Capitals
general manager who dealt him from Washington to the Bruins in
March 1997.
If the Bruins look for some insurance in net, said Sinden, they
won't be shopping in the unrestricted free agent market that
includes the likes of Curtis Joseph, Mike Richter, John
Vanbiesbrouck, and Sean Burke. They more likely would be hunting
for someone who has been a backup elsewhere, someone like Dafoe,
who wasn't considered a No. 1 with the Kings when LA dealt him
here. Dafoe sparkled for much of the 1997-98 season, compiling a
30-25-9 mark and a 2.24 goals-against average.

WASHINGTON In the great congressional smokeout of 1998, fear
of taxes trumped fear of cancer and that's a lesson lawmakers,
congressional challengers, and political consultants will apply to
Washington battles and local campaigns in the future.
The collapse of the antitobacco crusade this week was more
significant as a lesson in political science than as one in public
health. Although proponents of the bill spoke gravely about
tobacco's costs, the proposal failed largely because of fears,
stoked deftly by the tobacco industry, that the bill's new taxes
would provide money for new government spending.
Supporters of the legislation tried to portray it as a victim of
Big Money, but the opponents prevailed by saying that the measure
was a stalking horse for Big Brother and Big Government.
The defeat of the tobacco bill ends one of the two debates the
Republican Congress didn't want to have, but had anyway. The other
one, on the effort to overhaul the nation's campaign-finance
system, will almost surely dribble to a close in the next few
weeks, almost certainly with the same result.
