The council has never adopted its own budget since acquiring the
power to do so under the City Charter revision of 1989. And if, as
expected, the overwhelmingly Democratic council approves the
Vallone budget, the action is likely to trigger a series of legal
battles with the mayor, possibly beginning with a veto within the
next five days.
A vote for a separate budget would abruptly end a long period of
fiscal harmony between the city's two most powerful politicians,
whose annual budget negotiations have been complicated this year by
Vallone's gubernatorial ambitions and Giuliani's desire to secure a
new home for the Yankees.
Both men were able to iron out painful cuts during the recession
a few years ago; this year, New York's current financial boom has
given them ample room to propose costly, and competing, projects.
The mayor who wants to use $600 million over the next few
years to help pay for new ball parks, including a possible Yankee
stadium on Manhattan's West Side demanded that the speaker drop
his push for a referendum that would ask voters whether taxpayers'
money should be used for ball parks. Vallone, one of several
Democrats hoping to oppose Gov. George Pataki in November, refused
to even discuss the topic.
At the same time, the council speaker pushed for steep cuts in
the city's personal income tax, a proposal intended to give him a
strong selling point on the stump and to pre-empt any criticism
that he has supported tax increases in the past. In an apparent
reversal, the Republican mayor opposed these tax cuts, arguing that
the city could not afford them.
The cuts, which would cost the city about $201 million in
revenues in the next budget and more than $500 million a year after
that, could also jeopardize Giuliani's plan to use at least $600
million from a commercial rent tax to help pay for new stadiums,
especially if Wall Street's torrent into the city coffers turns
into a trickle.
Council leaders included the tax cuts in the spending plan that
they released Thursday. That plan also seeks to retire $165 million
in debt; it restores cuts by the mayor and finances some new
programs, including recycling, library services, after-school
programs and day-care services.
In the spending plan, the council said it could finance its
goals by cutting $112 million from various city agencies, and by
recalculating savings the city would get from reduced welfare
rolls, lower interest rates paid on its long-term debt, and other
areas. Joseph Lhota, the mayor's budget director, described these
assumptions as risky.
Mastro declined to say whether Giuliani would veto items from
the plan or veto it entirely, which he would have to do by
Wednesday. Although the council could then override his veto, the
mayor has said that he would impound city funds to spend on
programs which would likely move the fight from the City Charter
to the courts. The city's new fiscal year begins on July 1.
As the city government prepared to deal for the first time with
a nonconsensus budget, some officials bemoaned that the breakdown
would ultimately hurt taxpayers.
