On the other hand, Kovacevich has said he would buy another bank
if the price was right, and in this case it apparently was. Norwest
will exchange about 10 shares for each Wells share, representing a
premium of only about 10 percent to Wells' closing stock price on
Friday.
Big Wells investors, such as Warren Buffett, were apparently
willing to accept a slim takeover premium based on the combined
company's prospects. As of last December, Buffett owned 7.87
percent of the company.
Wells would have been unthinkable as a takeover target a few
years ago, when it emerged as the victor in a hotly contested
battle for First Interstate Corp. of Los Angeles, but Wells botched
the integration of the two banks. That cost Wells precious profits
and customers, and brought Hazen, long considered a skilled
manager, some unaccustomed criticism from analysts and Wall Street.
And it left Wells vulnerable.
Last Friday, Wells Fargo's shares rose 3 percent, or $10.75, to
$363.25, on optimism that profit growth will accelerate as the bank
builds revenue with little increase in expenses, along with
speculation that Wells Fargo might be in talks.
Like most Triple Crown hopefuls who fail in the Belmont Stakes,
Real Quiet was undone by the unusual length of the race here
Saturday, losing a four-length lead in the final furlong to be
nosed out by Victory Gallop.
If the Belmont were a mile and a quarter, a Triple Crown
wouldn't be such a rarity.
Real Quiet and jockey Kent Desormeaux led the field into the
homestretch but hit the marathoners' wall and staggered through a
26.34-second final quarter. Of the 14 horses who lost Triple Crowns
in the Belmont, nine had a final split slower than 26 seconds.
Of the 10 horses who completed Triple Crowns in the Belmont
since the race went to 1{ miles, eight went 26 seconds or faster.
There's the irony of the Belmont: The defining moment of these
horses' careers, the difference between winning and losing a
$5-million Triple Crown bonus, is a race at a distance completely
out of line with the rest of the U.S. stakes schedule.
Baffert and Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, will scan
that schedule for their colts' next starts, with a rematch of the
Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont quinella horses a
possibility.
