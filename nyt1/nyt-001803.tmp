If NATO guards the borders behind which they hide, the Serbs
will accuse it of sheltering terrorists. Western governments, which
have used that term to describe Kosovo's guerrillas, will be forced
to agree. That would be bad. But inaction would be worse.
Whatever NATO does, things can always get nastier in the
Balkans. If Serbia's crackdown became wholesale slaughter, it would
have to consider direct intervention in Kosovo. And the West would
face some more hard choices if Montenegro opted for independence
and Milosevic chose to send in his army.
NATO's next Balkan operation may not be its last. (To publish this excellent 750-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

Slobodan Milosevic, perhaps the most incompetent nationalist in
modern history, continues to hack away at what is left of
Yugoslavia.
On May 31 voters in tiny Montenegro, which, with Serbia, is all
that is left of the Yugoslav federation, strongly backed their
reformist president, who no longer recognizes the authority of
Yugoslavia's government. The next step may be a referendum on
independence.
Meanwhile, Milosevic is stepping up his war on separatists in
Kosovo, Serbia's Albanian-speaking province. Over 200 people have
been killed this year, perhaps 40 this week. Refugees are streaming
out of Kosovo. Young Albanians eager to join up with the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army are streaming in.
This is harrowingly familiar. Seven years ago Milosevic's
attempt to enlarge Serbia's share of Yugoslavia which then
included Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and Slovenia cost at least
100,000 lives.
Familiar, too, is the dilemma faced by western leaders: should
they watch the bloodshed, as they did for too long in Bosnia, or
risk compatriots' lives and their own political careers by getting
involved in somebody else's war, as America did in Vietnam?
Muscular diplomacy, they had hoped, would save them. The Contact
Group America, Russia and the four big West European countries punished Milosevic's aggression in Kosovo with sanctions. Even as
he continued to pound the Albanians, he agreed to talk to their
leader; sanctions were eased. But the West now admits it will have
to do more.
The separatists use both countries (and Montenegro) as havens
and as conduits for arms. Milosevic's forces might well be tempted
to chase them across borders, setting off a wider war.
