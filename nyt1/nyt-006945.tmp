Here, he is more than a fill-in guy. In three starts he has
moved to the head of the line.
ANAHEIM Angels manager Terry Collins says the Seattle Mariners
still scare him. But one can only imagine how the Mariners make
their own manager Lou Piniella feel.
A combination of poor defense and relief pitching by the
Mariners enabled the Angels to rally from a four-run deficit and
beat Seattle 11-5 before 30,268 at Edison Field Thursday night,
completing a three-game sweep of the defending AL West champions.
It was the Angels' fourth win in a row, their seventh in eight
games and their 16th in 18. They remained 1{ games ahead of the
Texas Rangers in the AL West, with the Rangers in town to begin a
three-game series against the Angels tonight.
Mariners third baseman Russ Davis made two errors that led to
two unearned runs. Two Mariners pitchers botched plays when the
Angels were willing to give up outs with sacrifice bunts. And even
Gold Glove winner Ken Griffey Jr. misplayed a ball that helped the
Angels score three runs in the seventh to take a 6-5 lead.
The Angels put the game away with a five-run eighth inning. In
all, the Angels had 15 hits, including three each by Gary DiSarcina
and Dave Hollins, and two apiece from Darin Erstad and Cecil
Fielder.
The Mariners bullpen came in with a reputation of blowing up
under pressure, and Thursday it lived up to it. The Angels scored
seven of their runs off the Mariners bullpen in two innings.
The key play of the game, though, took place in the seventh
inning with the Mariners leading 5-3. The Angels had runners on
first and third with none out when Hollins hit a towering pop fly
into shallow center. Griffey, who got no help from his middle
infielders, got a late jump and allowed the ball to fall in for a
gift single. The Angels cut their deficit to 5-4 on that play, then
scored the tying and go-ahead runs on sacrifice flies by Tim Salmon
and Fielder.
Angels starter Jarrod Washburn (3-0) appeared on his way to
getting his first major-league loss after falling behind early, but
he stuck around for 71/3 innings and got the win over Mariners
reliever Paul Spoljaric (3-1).
Mariners starter Jamie Moyer pitched well for six innings before
Piniella decided to go to his bullpen with a runner on and none out
in the seventh.
