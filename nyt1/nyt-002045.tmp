Indeed, one of the prime qualifications for membership on the
Rules Committee is fierce loyalty to the party leader, either
Speaker Gingrich or Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic
leader.
Both Solomon and the man who will succeed him next year if the
Republicans remain in control, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., are
known as Gingrich disciples.
Dreier, 45, a smooth, dapper Southern Californian with a
penchant for pinball, says the speaker calls the shots in the final
analysis.
Solomon, a conservative who worships Ronald Reagan, was
appointed to the post by Gingrich, who named all nine Republicans
to the committee. The four Democrats, picked by Gephardt, are
outnumbered more than 2-to-1, assuring that the speaker's desires
will be carried out.
What endows the Rules Committee with its huge clout is the fact
that every House member pushing legislation has to win the panel's
approval before the bill can go to the House floor.
As a result, virtually every House committee chairman and
subcommittee chairman attends a Rules Committee meeting in the
course of a session to ask the panel's blessing on particular
legislation.
The committee meets three or four times a week in an intimate
Capitol hearing room under three chandeliers. The beseeching member
sits at a small table, peering up at Solomon who looks down at the
witness from his perch atop a tall semi-circular dais.
Recently, Solomon has carried out the speaker's will by using
House rules to assure that the House won't approve campaign finance
legislation this year.
Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, D-N.Y., says Solomon effectively
killed the legislation by sending the bill to the House floor under
a rule that allows 12 different versions of the bill to be debated
and amended. This will require so much debate that there won't be
enough time to finish action.
In the 1950s and 1960s, then-rules chairman Howard Smith, D-Va.,
would block civil rights legislation by simply disappearing or
arranging for other committee members to be absent so that a quorum
wouldn't be present. Absent a quorum, the panel would adjourn.
