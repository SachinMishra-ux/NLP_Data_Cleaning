The change is also an admission that the old US policy did not
work. As celebrated dissidents were freed from prison, others were
put behind bars. Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
will stress that Washington wants basic legal reforms in China, not
simply a trickle of prisoner releases in coming months.
Once they settled in the United States, many of the former
dissidents lost their effectiveness as protesters. They spent more
of their time in school or making money or squabbling among
themselves.
This time, the administration has worked with non-governmental
groups in compiling a high-priority list of dissidents to be freed.
But their names have not been released. This is in sharp contrast
to last fall's Sino-American summit in Washington, when the White
House made no secret of its desire to see the release of Wei
Jingsheng and Wang Dan, prominent democracy activists.
Chinese prison cells are filled with other political prisoners.
By the government's count, some 2,200 remain locked up. The Clinton
administration has put special emphasis on several of them because
of the severity of their sentences or the unjust circumstances
surrounding their arrests. They include:
 Chen Longde, a human rights worker who was arrested in 1996 for
writing to the People's Congress about corruption and lack of
democracy. After suffering torture by electric shocks and beatings,
Chen jumped from a two-story platform at a labor camp. Barely
mobile because of two broken hips and a damaged kidney, he is still
forced to do labor, according to Human Rights Watch.
There are also people like Ngawang Choephel hardly a household
name here. Choephel, who who spent the 1992-93 academic year
studying and teaching ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in
Vermont on a Fulbright scholarship, was unfairly imprisoned by
China two years ago, according to US officials.
During a 1995 trip to Tibet, his homeland, he worked on a
documentary about music and dance. Chinese authorities arrested him
and charged him with spying. He was sentenced in 1996 to 18 years
in prison.
Eager to make an example of Tibetian political prisoners, China
rarely, if ever, releases them before their sentences end.
Human rights groups are divided about whether the US government
should concentrate on behind-the-scenes pleas for the release of
dissidents.
Tong Yi served as a secretary and researcher to Wei Jingshen,
the dissident. While Wei was imprisoned, she was dispatched to a
camp for more than two years. She never had a chance to dispute the
charges against her or to appeal her conviction.
