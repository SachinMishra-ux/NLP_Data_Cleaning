But Wall Street analysts say GM is overstaffed because its
market share in the United States has dwindled for lack of popular
auto designs. Fewer workers are needed to build the shrinking
number of family vehicles that GM sells.
GM sold 6.3 million cars and light trucks in 1985 and 4.7
million last year. By contrast, Ford's sales rose to 3.8 million
last year from 3.3 million in 1985. Chrysler's sales edged up to
2.3 million from 2.2 million in 1985 after adjusting for Chrysler's
purchase in 1987 of American Motors Corp.
ISTANBUL, Turkey Turks who believe that the military has
become too deeply involved in politics here are hoping that the
emergence of a new military commander in August will have a
profound effect on national life.
The five-year term of Turkey's Chief of Staff, Gen. Ismail Hakki
Karadayi, who has led the military deeply into politics in an
effort to stem what he says is the rise of religious
fundamentalism, expires on Aug. 30. His successor is likely to be
an officer who believes that the military should stay closer to its
barracks and further away from politics.
Turkey has had weak and fragmented governments for the last five
years. This week the latest in the line of embattled prime
ministers, Mesut Yilmaz, announced that he would resign at the end
of this year and that new national elections would be held in
April.
As civilian leaders have proved unable to overcome personal and
political rivalries, the role of the military has increased
considerably. It is now the country's most potent political force,
as it showed last year by forcing the resignation of Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, whom officers accused of supporting
fundamentalism.
The military has also taken over principal responsibility for
Turkey's relations with Greece and other nearby countries, as well
as for policy toward Cyprus and toward this country's Kurdish
minority. It encourages prosecutors to pursue cases against
writers, journalists and politicians who express heretical views on
these or other matters.
Military commanders have compiled a list of businesses that
government agencies should boycott because they have been deemed
favorable to political Islam. They are pressing Parliament to pass
a series of anti-fundamentalist laws, including curbs on Islamic
foundations and new restrictions on the construction of mosques.
With the military now so involved in civilian policy, and with
political parties so weak and fragmented, a change in the top
military command might have a far more profound effect on Turkish
life than an election.
The Turkish military command operates under strictly observed
rules and traditions. They dictate that Karadayi will step down in
August and that he will be replaced by the army commander, Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu.
