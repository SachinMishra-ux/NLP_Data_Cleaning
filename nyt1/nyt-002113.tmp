The shift is visible elsewhere. Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who studies
public opinion and demographic trends, says pollsters are now using
terminology she had never seen in survey research.
But last year, Yankelovich Partners asked bluntly whether the
president should submit to an examination of his genitals if
ordered to do so by the court in the Jones case. A question in a
different poll repeated verbatim Ms. Jones' description of what she
said Clinton did in her presence.
Not everyone sees a difference in what Americans are talking
about. Some say they believe that most people have always spoken
about sex and made jokes about it; the only difference now, they
contend, is that the news media are doing it too.
Among those who do believe that things have changed, some say it
is for the better. Anything that makes people more comfortable
discussing sex is good, they reason. Others, however, worry that
talk of sex is coarsening public conversation and edging out more
urgent topics.
OFRA, West Bank Yoyoda and Tamar Nizri are staying put. For
the young Israeli couple, the wild deer and unspoiled landscape
surrounding this isolated West Bank settlement is enough to
persuade them to remain.
They don't think much about the prospect that their settlement
15 miles north of Ramallah is likely to become an enclave in a sea
of Palestinian-controlled land if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
carries out the long-awaited troop withdrawal that Clinton
administration mediators have been pressing.
Their sentiments echo those of many of the 161,000 Jewish
settlers sprinkled throughout the West Bank. Shocked by the
prospect of living as Israeli satellites in what will likely become
Palestine in any final peace deal, many settlers prefer not to
dwell too much on an uncertain future. Instead, they take each day
at a time and hope that their government will find a way to keep
all of the 144 West Bank settlements under Israeli sovereignty.
But as U.S. pressure on Israel to cede additional territory to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority grows, the settlers'
ambiguous situation grows harder to ignore. For months, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has been pushing Israel to withdraw
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank, and Netanyahu has,
in public at least, held firm with an offer of 9 percent.
The implication has been that giving up more than 9 percent of
the West Bank would endanger Israel's security, but few people here
know exactly how it would. Netanyahu has guarded his negotiating
positions so closely that even members of his own Cabinet complain
that no one has seen the official map except the four members of
the inner circle.
U.S. mediators have not drawn up maps to avoid seeming to be
deciding on Israel's security, which they have said only Israel can
decide. The 13 percent figure was chosen so that the Palestinians,
who now fully or partially control 27 percent of the West Bank,
would hold an even 40 percent when negotiations on a final peace
deal begin.
