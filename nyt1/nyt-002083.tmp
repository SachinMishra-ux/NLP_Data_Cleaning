In case you missed it, the teams met the other night and got
into a glorious old-timey cat fight, the kind they used to have in
the game's golden era, when men were men and had big knots on their
heads from strategically aimed fastballs.
The spark was Kansas City pitcher Jim Pittsley's drilling
Anaheim's Phil Nevin in the seventh inning, which led to Anaheim's
Rich DeLucia hitting Kansas City's Dean Palmer in the eighth, which
led to Anaheim's Darin Erstad taking one in the thigh from Kansas
City's Scott Service in the ninth, which led to Kansas City's Jose
Offerman being hit by Anaheim's Mike Holtz, which led to a second
bench-emptying brawl in which Kansas City's Felix Martinez
sucker-punched Anaheim's Frank Bolick and then ran from his
retribution.
It was great theater no matter how you examined it five
beanballs, 12 ejections, and one career essentially self-immolated.
Martinez, who had already made a name for himself by kicking
Minnesota's Otis Nixon in the face back in April and breaking his
jaw, became the first major-leaguer since the old Giant pitcher
Ruben Gomez to perform the hit-and-run.
In that one, Gomez hit Milwaukee's Joe Adcock with a pitch, and
when Adcock, who was built like the box the United Nations building
came in, went after him, Gomez ran in terror. He was never the
same.
Martinez, after sucker-punching Bolick, a fairly inoffensive
backup infielder, saw several Angels chasing him and fled. Worse
yet, he fled unsuccessfully, being chased down and slugged by
pitcher Jack McDowell, who is on the disabled list.
Martinez's performance was so inspiring that his manager, Tony
Muser, dragged him off the field personally, and had him sent to
Triple-A Omaha on the next three-stop, two plane-change he could
book.
Baseball could have used a really good feud among two of its
lesser-lit teams, just to help goose a few crowds. Better to have
the miscreants on tour than on house arrest. Everyone likes to see
a villain, just on the off-chance he might perform some new
villainy. After all, why should the 12,020 who watched the
Angels-Royals brawls have all the fun?
This is a lesson professional wrestling learned years ago keep
the bad guys in plain sight. Do you think Strangler Lewis, or
Gorgeous George, or Nick Bockwinkel, or Hulk Hogan would have
become household words and living, breathing cash machines if they
were getting suspended every time they hit some guy with a chair, a
suitcase, a ring bell, or another fan?
Of course not. They'd go from city to city, finding some
fabulous new way to circumvent the rules of the sport just to keep
the customers interested, and more important, coming back. Today's
turnbuckle rope is tomorrow's metal suitcase, and the day after
that a forklift.
Baseball's deepest thinkers, though, believe that villainy
should be dealt with administratively rather than by the rules of
optometry (an eye for an eye, etc.), which is why the Royals and
Angels are about to feel the icy hand of Uncle Gene.
