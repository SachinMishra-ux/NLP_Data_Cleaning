The first Antoinette Perry Awards popularly known as Tonys were presented by the American Theater Wing in 1947 in the grand
ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria.
Named for the actress, director and producer who died in 1946
after having been one of the leaders of the wing, a theatrical
service organization, the awards have established themselves as the
most important in American commercial theater.
The Tony Administration Committee, including most of the key
players on Broadway and in national touring productions, oversees
the awards and determines who is eligible to vote for them.
A Tony Nominating Committee, which has 19 members, announced
this year's roster of nominees on May 4, beginning five weeks of
cocktail parties, awards ceremonies and behind-the-scenes jostling.
In the end, some 782 theater professionals and journalists were
eligible to cast ballots in 21 categories for Sunday night's
awards.
The instant success of the new format and the new host ratings
rose 35 percent over 1996 silenced those who had been
uncomfortable with the Tonys being held in a non-Broadway house and
presided over by a television talk show host.
Although many Broadway veterans were among the presenters Sunday
night, including Tommy Tune, Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth, the
producers also included numerous film and television personalities
who will appear or have appeared in recent shows, such as Helen
Hunt, Alec Baldwin and Marisa Tomei.
The three-hour awards ceremony was split into two programs.
During the first hour, which was broadcast on PBS by WNET/Channel
13 in New York City, all of the technical and behind-the-scenes
awards were presented, including the directing awards. This left
the subsequent two-hour CBS broadcast to distribute the awards for
best play, best musical, best revivals and all of the acting
awards.
CHICAGO The Utah Jazz has players with crew cuts and Scout
badges, good manners and accounting degrees. So polite, so
upstanding. And yet so unequipped to match the snarling nature of a
physical team that would just as easily kick sand in the face of
the Jazz.
The Chicago Bulls were the aggressors, while the Jazz played the
part of a team from the West typically overwhelmed by a hardened
East team that hit and hit hard.
When it was over, the Jazz went whimpering away from the United
Center after being humiliated 96-54 in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on
Sunday night.
