House Speaker Newt Gingrich tried to dispense with the campaign
finance issue in March under rules that never allowed the
Shays-Meehan bill to the floor. But the tactic backfired and gave
the issue momentum. So Gingrich, in an about-face, promised a full
and free-wheeling debate.
It may be more like a three-ring circus. In a House that is
usually tightly controlled, the Republicans are allowing a dozen
separate overhaul proposals to be considered, along with 257
separate amendments. (That number has been whittled down from
nearly 600 proposed amendments.) The proposal that emerges with the
most votes will then be taken up for final consideration.
Gingrich originally promised the issue would be debated by the
end of May. And debate did begin for several meandering hours and
without votes just before the Memorial Day recess. Debate was
scheduled to resume last week, but did not after the House spent
two days considering the budget. Republican leaders now say the
issue might come up this week, but Democrats suspect they are
stalling.
Republicans have carefully tailored amendments to create maximum
political embarrassment to the Democrats and to split the
bipartisan coalition.
And Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., has introduced an amendment
reminding voters of the Clinton campaign's excesses. It would
prohibit campaign contributions made in exchange for access to the
White House, Air Force One and Two, the vice president's residence
and Marine One and Two, the helicopters that carry the president
and vice president.
Last week, some supporters of overhauling campaign finance laws
began to fear that one measure that might get the most votes would
create a commission to study the issue and draw up a campaign
finance proposal. Because half of the commission's 12 members would
be appointed by Gingrich and by Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, who is also a supporter of the status quo, it was unclear
what the commission would come up with.
The two other leading bipartisan overhaul proposals are the
Shays-Meehan legislation and a proposal crafted by a group of House
freshmen. A difference between the bills is how they deal with
unregulated money.
The Shays-Meehan bill would effectively ban unregulated
contributions in federal elections by prohibiting such donations to
the national parties and by prohibiting state parties from using
unregulated money for any activity that could benefit a federal
candidate, including registration and get-out-the vote drives.
The bill drafted by the freshmen would ban the national
political parties and federal candidates from raising money through
unregulated contributions. State political parties could raise and
use such contributions but not transfer them between states.
A number of advocates of overhaul say they will vote for the
Shays-Meehan legislation and then fall back to the freshman bill if
their first choice does not gain a 218-vote majority.
