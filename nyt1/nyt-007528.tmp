Lately, critics have said that if Jordan hadn't left the NBA to
play baseball, the Bulls would have also won NBA titles in 1994 and
'95 the years the Rockets were league champions. Olajuwon said
such statements are absurd.
Between them, the Bulls and Rockets have won the past eight NBA
titles. But they've never met in the NBA Finals. It's a matchup
Olajuwon believes would be intriguing.
Olajuwon, 35, is bracing for the NBA's second lockout in three
years. The NBA and the NBA Players Association are trying to
negotiate a contract, and a lockout will likely be imposed unless a
deal is struck by July 1.
The Rockets have the 14th, 16th and 18th picks in Wednesday's
NBA draft, and Olajuwon said it's imperative that the picks are
used wisely.
Olajuwon will have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on his
right knee next month, with hopes of clearing up problems that led
to the least-productive season of his 14-year career. He had
surgery on his left knee this season, forcing him to miss a
career-high 35 games, and leading to him averaging career-lows in
scoring (16.4)) and field-goal percentage (.483).
ATLANTA -- Barring great fortune, the draft no longer is the way
to build a strong team in the NBA, and the next edition on
Wednesday bears testimony to that.
Of course, under current rules, a player drafted Wednesday can
become a free agent after three seasons, or about the time he
starts to blossom as a player. That's one of the changes the NBA
wants in its working agreement with the players association. Teams
are asking for options that will add two or three more seasons to a
rookie contract. That would serve to hold down salaries of young
players and also protect the investments of teams that are
building.
Sund recalls that in his years as player personnel chief in
Dallas, the Mavs thrived on the draft.
Among the projected top players in the draft, guards Mike Bibby,
Paul Pierce, Vince Carter and Larry Hughes, forwards Robert Traylor
and Antawn Jamison and center Nazr Mohammed are all underclassmen.
German Dirk Nowitzki and Houston high-schooler Rashard Lewis did
not go to college. And there are three others also making the jump
from high school.
Although Tim Duncan of San Antonio and Keith Van Horn of New
Jersey both stayed in college four years, few are induced to follow
their example.
