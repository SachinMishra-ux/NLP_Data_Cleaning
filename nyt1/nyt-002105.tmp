The majestic, 20,320-foot Alaskan mountain, known to many by its
Native American name of Denali, is often treacherous, its weather
fierce and unrelentingly frigid, epitomized during a recent spate
of storms that killed two climbers, one of them a would-be rescuer.
Experts say climbers on Denali are often assaulted by some of
the coldest, windiest weather in the world due to the mountain's
height and proximity to the Arctic Circle. Only about half the
1,100 climbers authorized every year to tackle Denali actually
reach the top, the others falling victim to frostbite or altitude
sickness.
Both expeditions, sponsored by the Breast Cancer Fund, a San
Francisco nonprofit organization founded in 1992, were intended as
metaphors depicting the battle against breast cancer. Aconcagua
raised $1.6 million distributed by the fund to various research
and advocacy programs.
Knoble, a consultant who recently retired from her job as a vice
president for Pacific Telesis, is herself still climbing a medical
mountain. First diagnosed with the cancer in 1993, she had a
recurrence last year and underwent double mastectomies.
On Thursday, three Bay Area members of the expedition departed
for Alaska from San Francisco Sandy Badillo, a tennis pro in Half
Moon Bay who was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago; Cathy
Ann Taylor, a Sausalito mountaineer who has worked as a guide in
Nepal and Tibet; and Marcy Ely, a teacher and family counselor who
lives in Napa.
A mountain climber since she was a girl, the 50-year-old Ely
trained arduously for two years for McKinley. She won't be making
the actual climb, however. Last month she learned that the cancer,
first diagnosed in 1991, had returned and spread to her liver and
lymph gland.
MEXICO CITY Light rains throughout Mexico are helping thin the
number of wildfires in the country, but the heavy rains needed to
douse the largest blazes might not come until next month, U.S.
relief officials said Friday.
And once the fires are out, officials say, global agricultural
experts must eradicate the slash-and-burn techniques responsible
for countless fires each year.
The fires and how to prevent them will be on the agenda when
Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo meets with President Clinton
next week on a trip to address the United Nations World Drug
Summit, said J. Brian Atwood, administrator for the Agency for
International Development.
The number of Mexican wildfires have dropped from 273 on May 24
to 143 on Thursday, Atwood told foreign correspondents.
