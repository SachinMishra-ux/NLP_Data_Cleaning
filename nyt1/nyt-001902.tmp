Which is just another way of explaining how the Jazz outscored
the Bulls 21-6 on fast-break points in Game 1. Despite the chronic
aches that afflict joints, and some decline in skill, Stockton and
Malone are confined to mid-30s bodies only by the numbers on their
drivers' licenses.
For Sloan, the ethic of Stockton and Malone exacts the kind of
teammate pressure that makes coaching new players easier.
It's no coincidence that the Jazz's opposition in this
tournament is led by a semi-elderly group (Michael Jordan, 35,
Scottie Pippen 32, and Dennis Rodman, 37) that also has told Father
Time to drop dead. Sloan was amused that so much was made of
Jordan's apparent game-ending fatigue Wednesday.
Yet what has driven them is not altogether mercenary. Jazz owner
Larry Miller told the Deseret News of a locker-room encounter with
Stockton a few years ago.
Nor is a calendar an effective instrument with which to measure
them.
SEATTLE It does not seem possible, but the Mariners discovered
another way to lose a game Thursday night. Unbelievably, the
bullpen was not a factor.
The Angels delivered the newest blow, a 6-2 defeat, which means
the Mariners have now been swept in two straight two-game series.
It won't happen again this weekend. The Dodgers are here for three
games.
Thursday night the Angels scored the winning run on a
suicide-squeeze play, unusual enough at the major-league level,
particularly when executed flawlessly.
Justin Baughman got the bunt down, and Orlando Palmeiro raced
home untouched as starter Ken Cloude threw to first for the second
out in the fourth inning.
With that, he sprayed on some cologne and walked away, the man
who took a called third strike to end the game.
