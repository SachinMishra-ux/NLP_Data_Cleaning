On top of that, Gingrich brought back Paxon to pry campaign
money from Republican House members for the GOP nominee in New
Mexico, Heather Wilson.
Linder stands by his prediction of a Republican gain of 10 seats
in November, more optimistic than most analysts and some Republican
colleagues.
The New Mexico election, to fill the seat held by the late Rep.
Steven Schiff, is the next test. Wilson and Democratic state Sen.
Phil Maloof are locked in a tight race and, whatever the result
Tuesday, they will square off again in November.
Both sides view the New Mexico election as critical. Dick
Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, and Dick Armey, the
Republican leader, are campaigning there this weekend.
Democrats also are sending Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California to
appeal to Hispanic voters. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice
presidential nominee, made an appearance for Wilson. Top political
operatives in both parties have been sent to Albuquerque as well.
Maloof, from a wealthy and politically well-connected family,
has paid for much of his race with family money, giving him a stout
advantage over Wilson.
But Paxon, whose ebullience contrasts with Linder's reserve,
said that by the time the election is over, he will have collected
$250,000 to $300,000 from fellow Republicans in the House for
Wilson's campaign.
He won't have time. The campaigns for the rest of the House will
intensify quickly during the next couple of months. Linder's
practiced calm, a vestige of an earlier career as a dentist, should
serve him well.
Linder's committee has raised more than $50 million, which will
allow it to give the maximum $70,000 to 100 candidates and finance
an array of issue ads that are not subject to Federal Election
Commission limits.
Those ads will counter an anticipated barrage from labor unions
in a couple of dozen districts, he said.
