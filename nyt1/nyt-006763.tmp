WASHINGTON Millions of people have left the welfare rolls
since Congress overhauled the federal program two years ago, but
what happened to them has been a puzzle for policy-makers. Now, the
most comprehensive study of the new system says more and more are
going to work.
The General Accounting Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress,
said Thursday that there had been sharp increases in the proportion
of welfare recipients being placed in jobs.
The findings address one of the biggest questions about social
welfare policy in America. Officials have expressed many opinions,
but until now had only sketchy, incomplete information about what
happened to the people leaving welfare.
Since President Clinton took office, the number of people on
welfare has fallen 37 percent, to 8.9 million in March 1998 from
14.1 million in January 1993. The number has dropped 27 percent
since August 1996, when Clinton signed a bill ending the federal
guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children.
Texas had a slight decline in the proportion of welfare
recipients who found jobs. Data from Connecticut, while not exactly
comparable, showed a substantial increase in the number of families
leaving welfare because of increased earnings.
The General Accounting Office reported that 17 percent of
Maryland's welfare recipients were placed in jobs in 1997, up from
4 percent in 1995. In Louisiana, the proportion rose to 17 percent,
from 6 percent, while in California it rose to 19 percent from 9
percent.
But Levin said that the progress of the last two years would be
jeopardized if House Republicans cut spending on programs for poor
people, as required under the budget blueprint approved by the
House on June 5.
Authors of the report were quick to point out that some
important questions remained unanswered. The report does not show
the effects of the 1996 law on the well-being of children. It does
not measure the extent of hunger or homelessness among people
removed from the welfare rolls. Nor does it show what will happen
if the economy, now booming, turns sour.
 Forty-two states have liberalized their rules on earned income
so that welfare recipients can keep more of their monthly cash
assistance payments after they begin working. Nearly all states
have increased their limits on the value of automobiles and other
assets that people can own while receiving public assistance.
 The proportion of adult welfare recipients who are told to
pursue education and job training has declined in the last three
years. Instead, people are routinely told to get jobs as soon as
they apply for welfare.
