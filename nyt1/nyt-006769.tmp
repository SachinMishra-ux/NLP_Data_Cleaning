Ms. Lewinsky was referred to Carter by Vernon Jordan, a close
friend of the president. Jordan has said that he took Ms. Lewinsky
to see Carter at about the time he was helping to arrange a job for
her and while she faced a subpoena in the sexual harassment lawsuit
brought by Mrs. Jones against Clinton. The subpoena ordered her to
provide testimony about her relationship with the president.
Emerging after a full day before the grand jury, Carter made no
statement and declined to answer reporters' questions. His lawyer,
Charles Ogletree, said that some questions were posed about
Carter's relationship with Jordan, but he declined to provide
details of the testimony or any other questions that his client had
been asked.
Both Carter and Ms. Lewinsky had argued that his conversations
with Ms. Lewinsky were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
But a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had presented evidence
that the privilege was not applicable because Ms. Lewinsky might
have used her lawyer to violate federal law, according to lawyers
who have seen the judge's ruling.
No evidence has surfaced to indicate that Carter did anything
improper in helping Ms. Lewinsky to prepare her affidavit.
But in immunity talks with prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky's
subsequent lawyers had proposed as part of secret settlement
discussions that she would be willing to testify that she did have
sex with Clinton, according to lawyers involved in those talks.
Also on Thursday, Attorney General Janet Reno said she had not
decided whether to open an inquiry following accusations in a new
magazine, Brill's Content, that Starr has made improper disclosures
to reporters about his investigation. Starr has denied those
accusations. Ms. Reno said she had referred the matter to the
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.
But Gary Stevens put off plans to ride in Europe this month
because the dates conflicted with tonight's NTRA All-Star
Championship at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
He describes last year's event as one of his greatest thrills in
racing, eclipsed only by his first Kentucky Derby victory in 1988
with filly Winning Colors, and by his Triple Crown near-miss with
1997's Silver Charm.
The four-race competition has proved so popular with the public
and the participants, it has become a national fixture in only its
second season. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, the
sport's new marketing arm, is sponsoring this year's renewal and
has brought aboard ESPN2 for a live 9-10 p.m. CDT telecast.
Stevens, last year's winner, will return to defend his title
against fellow Hall of Famers Jerry Bailey, Pat Day, Eddie
Delahoussaye, Sandy Hawley, Chris McCarron and Laffit Pincay Jr.
Rounding out the field are Kent Desormeaux, Julie Krone, Shane
Sellers, Mike Smith and Lone Star leading rider Marlon St. Julien.
