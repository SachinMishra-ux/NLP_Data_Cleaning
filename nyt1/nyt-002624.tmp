Cone was often erratic in his first nine starts. But there was
one consistent aspect to his pitching: his slider spun down and
away from right-handed hitters, six inches to a foot off the
outside edge of the strike zone.
Rarely did umpires call it for strikes, and Cone was not casting
the pitch close enough to home plate to tempt hitters into
swinging. His slider, which has been his best pitch in recent
years, had lost its value. There had to be a way he could throw it
more effectively.
After Veronica, his mother's dog, bit his hand, Cone fretted
about the effect the cut would have on his split-fingered fastball,
a pitch that requires pressure from his index finger. Catcher Joe
Girardi called for only one splitter in the first six innings, but
in the seventh, with the end in sight, Cone started throwing the
pitch one more thing for the Marlins' hitters to worry about.
Cone whiffed two in the seventh, to reach 10.
Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams all had homered
in the early innings, and the Yankees led by 4-0 as Cone took the
mound for the eighth. He struck out three more in the inning, but
lost the shutout on a booming double. Torre intended to call on a
reliever for the ninth, before Cone told him he wanted to throw the
last inning.
With his home run in the first inning, Paul O'Neill extended his
hitting streak to 15 games, the longest by a Yankee this season.
... O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams all homered, the
first time this season the Yankees' 3-4-5 hitters had hit home runs
in the same game and only the second time any two of them hit
homers in the same game. ... The Yankees have either won or tied
their last 22 series, extending the franchise record. It is the
most since the 1970 Cincinnati Reds won or tied 24 consecutive
series.
If Kenneth Starr has his way, any American who consults a lawyer
from now on will face the possibility that after his or her death
the lawyer will be forced to testify about the conversation in
federal criminal proceedings. The confidential character of the
lawyer-client relationship will end.
That is the position taken by Starr in a case being argued in
the Supreme Court on Monday. He wants to see three pages of
handwritten notes that were taken by a Washington lawyer, James
Hamilton, when Vincent Foster came to see him in 1993. Foster,
assistant White House counsel, was suffering from severe
depression. Nine days later he committed suicide.
No federal prosecutor before Starr has made that claim. A
divided U.S. Court of Appeals held in this case that the
lawyer-client privilege could be overridden if a trial judge found
that a lawyer's evidence about a deceased client was likely to be
substantial and unavailable elsewhere. But Starr, unsatisfied with
that balancing of interests, asks the Supreme Court to hold that
the privilege always ends with death.
But a truthful person may want to speak in confidence to a
lawyer. The criminal law is so full of traps for the unwary these
days that anyone even tangentially concerned would be a fool not
to. The discussion may well include the client's suspicions about
others that he would not want published after his death. And he
might care about his own posthumous reputation.
Fear of later disclosure may lead an honest person to keep
things back from a lawyer to be less than candid. The
lawyer-client privilege is rooted deeply in our law precisely
because it encourages the client to speak candidly and enables the
lawyer to give meaningful advice.
