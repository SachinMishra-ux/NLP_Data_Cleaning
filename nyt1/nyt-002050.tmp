Holten reported the tiger snake case in May at the Annual
Scientific Congress of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons in
Sydney.
It is the first time the newly developed vacuum-assisted closure
(VAC) device, has been used to reduce the often devastating
aftereffects of a snakebite.
Invented by Louis Argenta, a plastic surgeon from the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem,
N.C., the VAC wound system is being made by a Texas-based company,
Kinetic Concepts. Argenta says that by getting rid of fluid, the
VAC can make wounds heal four times faster than they would
otherwise.
The tiger snake victim had been bitten on the foot. Although her
life was saved by an antivenin injection, a hole 3 centimeters
square opened up around the bite, and her foot swelled and became
painful. Holten put a foam dressing in the hole then used a thin
plastic film to seal the area. Then, using the vacuum pump, which
was attached to a tube embedded in the foam, he sucked off the
fluid.
Next, Holten wants to test the technique on a patient whose leg
has ulcerated from toe to knee after being bitten by Australia's
venomous white-tailed spider.
But Ken Winkel from the Australian Venom Research Unit at the
University of Melbourne says it is far too early to know if the
technique will become a commonplace way to deal with the effects of
bites.
The small suction device draws off the fluid which often
contains toxins and bacteria generated by an inflammatory trauma
response within the wound. It is this fluid which blocks key blood
vessels and leads to necrosis the death of surrounding tissue.
Until now, repairing necrotic skin would have meant expensive
plastic surgery and a long stay in the hospital.
But hopes have been raised in Australia after doctors
successfully treated a 42-year-old woman for a wound caused by a
tiger snake's bite.
With a vacuum technique normally used for treating wounds caused
by accidents or gunshots, Ian Holten, a plastic surgeon from the
Geelong Hospital near Melbourne, extracted half a liter of fluid
from the victim's wound in 24 hours. As a result, blood was able to
flow normally again, promoting the growth of healthy tissue.
