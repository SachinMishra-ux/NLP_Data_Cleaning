To get that truth, Starr has done most things short of cracking
kneecaps. He has hidden a microphone on an accomplice. He has
subpoenaed bookshop records to see what Lewinsky might be reading.
He has allowed a witness who refused to talk to be kept in jail for
nearly two years.
Starr, having won a legal battle over the right to require
Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, to testify, filed a brief
with the Supreme Court, urging that he be let loose on various
other members of the White House staff, including Secret
Servicemen, who have never yet had to divulge the content of
private presidential conversations. No matter: the truth must out.
Those were the headlines. But, on June 1, Starr also gave a
speech to a bar association in North Carolina, in which he expanded
on his passion for the truth at some length.
Even before this speech, it was often said that the prosecutor's
moral sense was unusually developed: he had grown up as the son of
a conservative minister in small-town Texas; he had never smoked or
drunk or cursed.
It was also said that his lifestyle exuded disciplined devotion:
his teenage hobby was shoe-polishing and his summer job was selling
Bibles; and, though he is busy these days, he likes to rise early
and jog to a creek near his house, where he pauses to sing a hymn
and pray.
It is not surprising, Starr says, that even though 25 out of 42
presidents have been lawyers, the profession is held in contempt
these days. One of the candidates in the Washington, D.C., mayoral
primary is campaigning on the fact that he is not a lawyer.
The unwavering pursuit of truth should indeed animate
prosecuting lawyers like himself; but if you run Starr's general
argument by Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who is America's leading legal ethicist, you get an
interesting reaction.
Even though no lawyer should be party to perjury, defense
counsels have a duty to impede the search for truth in other ways.
They may advise their clients to invoke the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, which means they can refuse to testify. They may argue
that incriminating evidence is inadmissible on technical grounds.
Even if they know their client to be guilty, defense lawyers are
supposed to pick holes in the prosecution's arguments, and to get
their clients off.
