Romaneck said she learned for the first time that police and
fire officials suspected foul play in her sister's deaths in 1995,
when she was given copies of their death certificates.
They had been amended by investigators who re-examined the fire
after Romaneck had come forward about her mother's disappearance.
They concluded that the 1967 investigation was flawed, that the
fire was caused by arson, and that the girls' deaths were
homicides. Officials have yet to decide whether to charge Keidel
with them.
In a deposition, a retired fire investigator, Bob Biven, said
that in 1967 he had suspicions about the fire. He said it appeared
to have started in more than one place, but he could not eliminate
the pan on the stove as a possible source.
Moore later said in a deposition that he could not rule out the
pan on the stove and that he believed the fire was an accident.
But the detective also acknowledged that he didn't interview the
surviving children and didn't see the bodies of the dead children
and their burns, or photos of the dead children.
At the time, another Phoenix detective was investigating the
disappearance of Keidel's wife four months before the fire, court
records show, and believed that Keidel was a possible suspect.
Romaneck said Thursday she still has vivid memories of the day
of the fire. Her older sister, Karen Sue, tried desperately to
protect her.
LOS ANGELES In adopting a plan that would allow massive growth
in Los Angeles boosting the population 25 percent by 2010 city
officials failed to properly tell the public the staggering costs
of meeting the needs of 820,000 new residents, a judge has ruled.
Two years after the City Council adopted a General Plan
Framework to guide overall development, Superior Court Judge David
Yaffe tentatively ruled Thursday that the city must hold additional
hearings and give the public a chance to review and comment on how
to meet traffic and transit needs, and whether the city has the up
to $25 billion available to meet them.
The judge's decision could at least temporarily set aside the
General Plan until the additional hearings are held and the plan is
readopted in its current or modified form.
