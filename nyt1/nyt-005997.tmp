Even companies and government departments that think they have
made the necessary technical adjustments will be vulnerable to
disruptions if their suppliers and other contacts have failed to do
so.
One does not have to believe the most extreme scenarios to take
the sensible precautions most experts now recommend. Businesses,
for instance, should assign top managers, not just technical
experts, to the problem, draw up contingency plans for coping with
systems failures and postpone complicated operations like
accounting changes.
Much of the same applies to governments, which have the added
responsibility for heading off military disasters, such as might be
caused, for example, by false warnings of nuclear missile attacks.
Above all, political leaders urgently need to explain the risks
and activate coordinated responses. In the United States, there is
widespread amazement at the silence of Vice President Al Gore, the
administration's top computer geek, whose bid for the presidency in
the 2000 elections could be at stake.
There is no need to take to the hills, as some survivalists are
urging. But the Central Intelligence Agency is advising its
employees to pay their bills early in December 1999, keep cash on
hand and lay in extra blankets.
And many people, whether they are superstitious or not, probably
won't want to be in a plane as the millennium dawns. (To publish this 650-word article from the International Herald

WASHINGTON Just like the advent of the first millennium, the
approach of the year 2000 is bringing dire predictions of disaster.
Doomsayers are warning of aircraft falling from the sky, riots,
famine, martial law and stock market crashes.
This time, however, the warnings are based not on superstition
but on hardheaded analyses of the potentially devastating effects
of the so-called millennium bug the inability of computers to
recognize the year 2000 because past programmers used only two
digits to denote years, without identifying the century.
A few scattered optimists still argue that the problem has been
grossly exaggerated, and it is true that some of the worst-case
scenarios are overly hysterical. But most experts insist that it is
now too late to avoid serious disruptions.
Several hundred professionals surveyed by the Washington D.C.
Year 2000 Group rated the impact of the problem on the United
States at an average of just under five on a scale of zero to 10 with 10 representing the collapse of the U.S. government and
possible famine.
