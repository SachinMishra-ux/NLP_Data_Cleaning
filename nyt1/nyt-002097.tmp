The location of the training camps in the lawless backlands of
northern Albania has become the focus of intense interest. The
Albanian government, which since the collapse of its central
administration last year has little influence here, says the camps
do not exist.
None of the men interviewed, even those who said they had been
trained and were about to head over the mountains into Kosovo, were
willing to say where the training took place.
The ubiquitous presence of men in combat boots and black fatigue
pants in the border towns of Tropoje and Bajram Curri seems to
suggest that the camps are inside Albania along the frontier with
Serbia.
The counterinsurgency campaign begun by the Serbs in March to
wipe out the rebels in the central Drenica region in Kosovo
Province set off the rush to fight by the young Albanians in the
diaspora.
Gruesome pictures of some of the 80 people killed in the Serbian
sweep in March, mostly women, children and the elderly, were widely
disseminated by the ethnic Albanian leadership. Exile groups put
the grisly photos on the Internet.
A 24-year-old university student, who gave his nom de guerre as
Gjon and who was born and has lived all his life in Germany, sat
with six friends in a small coffee shop in downtown Bajram Curri.
He and the other volunteers will cross the border in a day or two.
They will travel into an area where the Serbian military has been
pounding villages with heavy artillery for a week, and where
streams of refugees are fleeing into Albania.
Western observers say as many as 40,000 people could be
displaced from their homes by the attack, which is intended, they
said, to create a free-fire zone along the length of the border
with Albania.
The Serbs apparently hope that the zone, emptied of civilians,
will be a buffer to halt the smuggling of weapons and supplies from
Albania to the rebels fighting in the province, these officials
said.
The specter of Bosnia, where 200,000 people were killed and
hundreds of thousands of Muslims and ethnic Croats expelled from
their homes by the Serbs, weighs heavily on the volunteers. All
said Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million people are ethnic
Albanian, would be emptied of all ethnic Albanians if Belgrade is
permitted to continue its military operations.
Those who arrive from Europe are confronted with crushing
poverty. The dusty towns in northern Albania often lack running
water and regular electricity. There is often no local authority,
other than a warlord and his group of armed henchmen. Many said
they were still trying to adjust to the chaos, poverty and
isolation.
