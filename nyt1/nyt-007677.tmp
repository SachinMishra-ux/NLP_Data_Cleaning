Benarroch and La Bergere, a vacuum cleaner salesman, had once
been friends with similar tastes and much in common. They both had
sons named Alan, a love of tennis and a partnership in a Venezuelan
tennis club. La Bergere even married and later divorced a woman
Benarroch had dated.
La Bergere's family told Wingate the two men became enemies
after La Bergere discovered Benarroch stealing from the partnership
in the early '90s and informed their other partners. There were
word wars in the Venezuelan media and legal battles that further
drained Benarroch's accounts, detectives said. Benarroch was
furious he'd been pushed out and was no longer allowed in his own
club, Wyllner told detectives.
In 1993, La Bergere received an unsigned death threat written
from Benarroch's point of view and style; it vowed vengeance within
10 years for having been cheated of $417,000 in the tennis club
venture, detectives said.
About that time, Benarroch was also thought to have been the
author of a death threat sent to Yuz of Fort Lauderdale, police
there said. Yuz had encouraged Benarroch to invest in Premium Sales
Corp., a Miami grocery trading company later accused of fleecing
hundreds of investors out of more than $400 million, investigators
said. Benarroch claimed to have lost $600,000 the last money he
had, King said.
Yuz was gunned down in his Mercedes-Benz May 12, 1997,
detectives said, by a man carrying a doll and wearing a fake beard.
The shooting occurred exactly three months after La Bergere was
killed in Palm Beach County.
When Palm Beach County detectives asked Benarroch to come in for
an interview, Benarroch insisted he was innocent and referred them
to his lawyer. The attorney, another of his tennis acquaintances,
turned down the interview request.Editor's question: A 1997 story
said the lawyer did talk to police??
By the time Yuz was killed, Benarroch didn't have the money to
hire hit men, King said. The detective said the property at the
Cricket Club had been foreclosed upon and Benarroch was moving from
one hotel to another; all but one of his credit cards had been
closed for non-payment.
Warm reports about Prince Charles have begun to blossom on both
sides of the Atlantic this summer. Some little green fingerlings
of fact, like his contribution of a watercolor he painted of Hong
Kong harbor to an auction this week at the New York Academy of Art gently suggest a creative spirit, a charitable heart. But there
are big flattering images of princely purpose ripening into color,
too.
Such a shift in image can sometimes be the result of artful
public relations work, a careful mulching and watering of the
media. The British press, chastened by the criticism of its pursuit
of Diana, the princess of Wales, in the wake of her death, has been
in a mood to be receptive. The image of England's remote,
expensive, undisciplined royal clan was in dire need of freshening.
There were also issues of personal character. When Diana's
traumatic death brought the monarchy's cold ineptitude into such
sharp relief, the perception of the prince had been crumbling,
piece by piece, through almost two decades of marital scandal and
disintegration. She had become an icon of glamour, motherhood and
good deeds. His public persona had been reduced to that of an
eccentric blunderer: unrequited in love and work, ineffectual in
fatherhood, moodily puttering in his garden.
