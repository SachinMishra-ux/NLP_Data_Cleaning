Nichols and the other forest service firefighters carry a
folded-up fire safety tent made of a space-age aluminum-foil type
material. If the fire engulfs them, they are supposed to jump off
their 'dozers, run back into the fire line they've cut and
hopefully find a spot where the fire has already passed. Then they
break out the tent and jump inside.
Mark Hebb, a forestry division district manager, ambled over to
the crew, who were gathered around a pickup waiting for a van to
carry them home for a few hours' rest.
The fire raged through the 40 acres of pine trees that Jim
Hooten was hoping to harvest in a few years as a nice addition to
his retirement income. It burned up a feed shed and two barns full
of farm equipment, antiques and family heirlooms.
But the family home still stands, untouched, a black fire line
still smoldering in the pines that march to within 20 feet of the
house.
To an outsider, the KB drugstores here were nothing but boxy
buildings with funny purple signs a bit of an eyesore next to the
mansions along St. Charles Avenue. But natives loved them, and when
the Pennsylvania-based national chain Rite Aid bought them out,
many vowed they would never shop there again.
Why all the fuss over a dying drugstore chain? Because a battle
for the soul of New Orleans is being waged, and, for the moment,
the outsiders are winning.
At least a dozen locally owned institutions have sold out or
closed in the past three years, and national chains, once
conspicuously absent here, are arriving in droves. The likes of the
House of Blues, Pottery Barn and Starbucks opening this summer are making the city feel more ... American. To many in this
aggressively untrendy town, Americanization represents a fate worse
than hurricanes, heat waves and bad oysters.
In 1994, the House of Blues, a slick, no-expenses-spared
nightclub chain owned, in part, by Dan Aykroyd, opened in the
French Quarter. The club immediately stole big local acts such as
the Neville Brothers from the considerably less glitzy local icon
Tipitina's. The old club almost closed.
In May, Maison Blanche, another local department store on Canal
Street, announced it had been sold to Dillard's Inc. The Arkansas
chain probably will close the downtown store and rename the ones in
the suburbs.
This summer, Starbucks, the ubiquitous Seattle coffeehouse
chain, will open in Uptown, a tony, residential area near Audubon
Park served by locally owned coffeehouses with strong followings.
Some are wondering whether Starbucks will go head to head in the
French Quarter with the famous Cafe Du Monde, home of chicory
coffee and sugary beignets.
