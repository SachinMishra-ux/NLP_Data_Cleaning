Thornton felt better after the 1,600-meter relay prelims. The
Longhorns' quartet of Matt Ellis, David Aaron, Terrence Wakefield
and Calvin Williams ran the fifth-fastest qualifying time, 3
minutes, 6.10 seconds, to advance to the finals.
The Longhorns women, meanwhile, fared well in their bid for
their first outdoor team championship since 1986. The UT women
advanced nearly everyone they expected to except for Liz Diaz in
the 1,500, and got sparkling performances from Suziann Reid in the
400 dash and 1,600 relay.
Reid, the national leader who won the NCAA outdoors as a
freshman and the NCAA indoors in March, broke her own school record
in the 400 with a clocking of 50.86 seconds. The junior also
anchored Texas' 1,600 relay that recorded a season-best clocking of
3:29.40.
Feeling good was something that escaped Wagner and Boswell.
Fighting gusty winds that played havoc with their approaches,
Wagner failed to clear the opening bar of 6-11 to no-height for the
first time in his life. Boswell, a native of Brompton, Ontario,
Canada, who was competing in front of his mother, three sisters,
girlfriend and numerous other friends, passed at 6-11, cleared 7- 0
1/2 on his second try and missed all three attempts at 7-2 1/4.
For Wagner, who competed most of the year on a left knee that
will require arthroscopic surgery in about two weeks for cartilage
damage, Thursday's competition pretty much told the story of his
season.
FIERZE, Albania The rusted hulk of a ferry, its bilge pumps
spewing water into the emerald green Drinit River and its diesel
engine rattling, has become for hundreds of young men the last leg
on a journey to war.
On the upper decks small knots of ethnic Albanians, some of the
600,000 Albanians in Germany and Switzerland, squatted and
whispered among themselves.
Six bearded Islamic militants with white skullcaps stood near
the railing with thousand-mile stares that seemed to inhibit the
conversation around them. The milling groups and hushed tones gave
the boat, which shuttles each day the two hours between Koman and
Fierze, the aura of a troop ship heading into battle.
The men have left behind families, jobs, however menial, and
peace to fight for a separate state with the Kosovo Liberation Army
against the Serbian military.
Many speak German better than they do Albanian and know little
of their homeland other than the idealized visions imparted to them
by their refugee parents in cramped apartments in Munich or Zurich.
Most are motivated by a romantic fervor that must make up for an
appalling lack of military preparation.
