But the travail of his first Sonic go-round provides a couple of
lessons useful this time: Things can slip away quickly, and one
can't assume that today's pain will be tomorrow's pain.
Based on the disparity between the Sonics and Lakers in the
playoffs, and the disparities between L.A. and Utah, and Utah and
Chicago, it's clear that the 60-win benchmark in the
expansion-bloated NBA has been cheapened dramatically.
By April, the aging Sonics had slid considerably. At least four
players in the rotation Jim McIlvaine, Nate McMillan, Sam Perkins
and Dale Ellis could no longer play the Sonic-style defense,
because of injury, age or inability. Should there have been an
injury to any one of the remaining regulars, the Sonics were doomed
to another first-round disaster.
While the return of Gary Payton, Vin Baker, Detlef Schrempf and
Hersey Hawkins would seem to bode well, they each did enough things
poorly in the playoffs to suggest that the team Westphal inherits
is more vulnerable than it appears on paper.
Sonic president Wally Walker will need to do more than simply
sign up free agents to fill vacancies. Years of failure to develop
young talent under Karl means Walker has to be extremely aggressive
and/or lucky to avoid a 10- to 12-game dropoff.
Think Karl would have said that? When Walker talks of Karl's
inability to be on the same page with the organization, it has to
do more with unshared goals such as developing young players than
it does with leaks to the press.
A growing assumption is that Payton will be the same headache to
manage for Westphal that he was to Karl. While Payton, 30 by next
season, isn't likely to transform as Johnson did, his dealings with
Westphal might prove more positive.
Westphal is a cooler, less emotional commander than Karl, whose
temper made for regular flashpoints with the equally dyspeptic
Payton. The relationship between Payton and Karl was frayed enough
to have become counterproductive.
Westphal made clear he will indulge a double standard with
Payton, as he did with Charles Barkley in Phoenix. If that
arrangement is understood and accepted by the team from the start,
rather than develop awkwardly over time, the tension drops
substantially.
The x-factor in the Sonic future is the bitterness that will be
generated from the impending lockout of NBA players forecast for
July 1.
