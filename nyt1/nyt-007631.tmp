More than 1,500 riot police have been deployed ahead of Monday's
World Cup soccer match between England and Romania. Bars have been
ordered to close at midnight. Open-air concerts have been called
off.
Certainly, the measures looked draconian on Sunday. Even an
English mascot, a man dressed up as a lion, looked docile enough,
padding around central Toulouse with all the menace of a poodle.
The main ambition of most fans seemed to be to burn as red as
possible as fast as possible while singing as out of tune as
possible.
There is the sun, of course, particularly scorching when
combined with alcohol. There is high unemployment, especially among
North African immigrants and their children. There is strong
support for the xenophobic National Front party. And now there is
the spark of soccer, at once religion, ritual, and, for some,
surrogate war.
Police reports now suggest that there was indeed some
provocation of the English in Marseilles from the large population
there of Tunisian or North African descent. As the arrest Sunday of
dozens of German fans in Lens showed, the English are by no means
alone. It is sometimes hard to know where soccer thuggery meets
plain vandalism.
The tournament also leaves plenty of room for good old-fashioned
bigotry. Soccer, it was once said, is not a life-and-death matter;
it is much more important that that. Never mind Romania, several
English fans said Sunday. Just wait for the old rivals Argentina
or Germany and then the real action will start.
TEHRAN, Iran After just a couple dramatic soccer goals, one of
the most restrictive countries on earth could not be restrained.
Throngs of Iranians millions by some unofficial estimates took to the streets and clogged them at 1:30 a.m., blowing horns,
dancing and chanting immediately after their national team's 2-1
defeat of the United States in the World Cup soccer tournament in
Lyon, France.
At 3:30 a.m. in Tehran, a city where it is usually difficult to
find a restaurant open after midnight, car horns were still
blaring.
The fever over the game illustrated the extremes of Iran's
culture in flux, where women can still be arrested unless they
cover their hair with scarves, where alcohol is prohibited and
where the national image centers on its mantle as a country for the
persecuted downtrodden.
Earlier, at a community center in an upscale north Tehran
neighborhood, about 80 fans became irate when police entered and
shut off the televised game broadcast that was taking place on a
big screen.
