Q: The United Methodist Church and some other denominations make
a distinction between civil rights and the role in the church. They
call for equal employment rights for gays and lesbians and yet will
not ordain them or bless their unions in the church. Do you see any
conflict in these positions?
A: What we've seen is an evolution in the church's understanding
of civil rights. When you get to the point when you can say they
deserve civil rights why wouldn't you ordain them?
A: If you interpret Scripture literally take the text and what
it says ... it probably means you have a conclusion about any
subject. `Women shouldn't preach.' You can go to Scripture and find
a verse to support it. `Homosexuality is an abomination.' It's
easy. You don't have to do a lot of study. The other way to
interpret Scripture and to me the only way is to do it
historically and critically. We have to know what was going on
historically and culturally to know what the author meant and what
the first audience heard. You find a nugget of truth and apply it
today.
A: My own experience is that I had every reason in the world not
to be gay. I was a preacher's kid. I was a missionary overseas and,
with my husband, was a stateside missionary supported by friends
and churches. I knew if those people knew what I was struggling
with, then it would devastate them and devastate our ministry. I
was married and had two beautiful children. ... But my own
experience tells me this is who I am. You get to the point where
your only chance at freedom is letting it all go. Until I stopped
fighting, I could not be whole.
Even though the church was not always there for me, God was
always there for me. It's one reason it's been important for me to
stay in the church and try to educate people.
Q: What is your position on the ordination of sexually active
homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions?
A: My personal position and that of the church is that the
practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.
Sometimes the church is criticized for being closed to homosexuals.
That's not the case at all, but there's a careful distinction
between orientation and practice.
Q: So the church essentially says to homosexuals that they have
to change or remain celibate?
Q: To join the United Methodist Church, a person pledges to try
to live by its teachings. Some have suggested that practicing
homosexuals not even be admitted to membership. Would you go that
far?
A: While I don't think we would go on any witch hunt or anything
like that, we would hope that people understood the church's
position and were willing to be loyal to the church.
