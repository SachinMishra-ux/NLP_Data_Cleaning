The government already has a Resolution and Collection Bank,
which can absorb failed institutions, but its activities are not
comprehensive enough to deal fully with bankrupt banks.
Ryuji Konishi, an economic consultant and former banking
executive who favors the idea, compares the bridge bank to a
fishnet that catched only the fish too weak to swim away on their
own.
Not surprisingly, the weak banks are extremely sensitive to this
proposal because they do not want to be, in effect, taken over by
the government.
Earlier this year, the government also put together a $221
billion bank bailout that would support depositors and help the
banks rebuild their capital.
But the banks have drawn only 1.8 trillion yen. Weak banks are
reluctant to ask for money for fear that such an admission of
weakness would drive down their share prices.
Some foreign investors would like to see the government put up
even more than 30 trillion yen, either through a bridge bank or
another rescue package.
SAN FRANCISCO By 3:30 Thursday afternoon, when Casey Martin
finally teed off his dream, the fog and chill and mist all were
rolling in from the Pacific Ocean. Martin's tale had been warm, but
now it would be played out in the chill of reality and competition.
The grandstand behind the first tee was packed. Melinda and King
Martin, Casey's parents, searched high and low for seats, and when
they finally were able to sit down, husband gripped the hand of
wife, father the hand of mother.
After that first tee shot, King Martin removed himself from his
wife and family and friends and walked alone for much of the way at
The Olympic Club, needing the solitude to steel himself so he could
watch his son swing through a dream.
Martin wished that he did not have to ride in a cart as he
stepped into it on that first hole.
