SALAMANDER-POEM AUSTIN U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin

NEWS-QUESTIONS The architect of Coors Field, Denver; Selective
Service registration; baseball players who hit four home runs in a
game; hurricane names; and more. Gleaned from the week's news Q A. (Bessonette, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
STREET-MINISTER RIVIERA BEACH About a year ago, after a
prophetic vision, Rev. Lessye Charlow set out to drive the drug
trade from her street. A minister for 45 years, she knows only one
way how. Several evenings a week, she wields a second-hand crucifix
and a personalized Bible, with the Red Sea miracle flagged by a
yellow Post-It note, and marches down the middle of West 33rd,
filling dealers and admirers alike with dread. (Trontz, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
FOOD-COBBLER Cobblers and crisps are two of the best and
easiest ways to showcase our favorite summer fruits, including
peaches, blackberries and cherries. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
HELLER-COOKBOOK The lazy days of summer arrive officially next
week, so we went looking for cookbooks that are a good read. We
wanted more than just a collection of recipes. (Heller, Dayton
Daily News) MOVED.
BEER-MSKUBE Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical
7-ounce glass with no ornamentation. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED. EMBARGOED FOR 6/18.
FOOD-RECIPESWAP Frances Bowie recently e-mailed Recipe Swap
looking for the Mix-Easy Two Egg Cake recipe from the cookbook and
manual that came with her Dormeyer mixer in 1948. Luckily, there
were a handful of pack rats out there who pulled out their Dormeyer
mixer manuals from around the same time and found the recipe. And
readers Dorothy Barr and Ruth Eunice, both of Atlanta, reported
their mixers were still working. (Recipe follows.) (Walker, Atlanta

GETAWAY-TUSCUMBIA Country star Ronnie Milsap will headline the
entertainment at the 20th annual Helen Keller Festival, June 25-28
in the quaint Tennessee River town of Tuscumbia, Ala. Milsap, who

will give a free concert at 8 p.m. June 27 in Spring Park, site of
the festival's arts and crafts fair and other musical events.

YBORFLA TAMPA I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago
when Ybor was a crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night
neighborhood. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
YBORFLA-WALKINGTOUR TAMPA Carmen Morales, who grew up in
Ybor City, can bring the past back with anecdotes that make a
1-mile walking tour a lively excursion. A volunteer guide, she'll
tell you about her history, which is Ybor's history, too.
