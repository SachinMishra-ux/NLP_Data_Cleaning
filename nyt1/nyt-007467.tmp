Unlike most American enterprises, those in the golf business
aren't as worried about government regulators as they are about the
U.S. Golf Association, which is to golf what the Financial
Accounting Standards Board is to accounting.
The buzz in golf circles in recent months was that USGA fears
about high-tech equipment making golf too easy would soon result in
a regulatory squeeze play. Topping the rumor list was a prohibition
on over-sized titanium drivers of the type pioneered by the folks
at Callaway. Another rumor was that the number of clubs allowed for
play would be reduced from 14 to 12, which was perhaps the most
frightening prospect for most equipment makers.
The claim that golf is becoming too easy likely seems fatuous to
anyone familiar with the game. Callaway, however, opted not to
depend entirely on common sense and intuition to guide the debate.
Rather, it took an industry leadership role by purchasing ads in
major publications to explain why the rumored concerns of the USGA
were groundless.
Pertinent points included in these ads were the fact that
handicaps for average golfers have remained about the same for a
generation while scoring on the pro tour hasn't been improved
appreciably by high-tech weapons. Byron Nelson's record
single-season scoring average, Callaway noted, has remained
unbroken for more than a half a century.
The Callaway ad, though, didn't get into golf's centuries-old
evolution. Golf began as a primitive pastime using wooden-shafted
clubs to hit balls stuffed with feathers around grazing lands.
Today's equipment and courses approach a perfection made possible
by modern science and agronomy. Nevertheless, golf remains probably
the most difficult to master of all the games ever created.
Callaway's challenge to the game's clubby mandarins no doubt
helped carry the day, because none of the worst of what was feared
came to pass. When the USGA used this year's U.S. Open tournament
as the forum to announce its much-feared equipment rules changes,
it opted mainly for the status quo. Equipment currently available
apparently will remain so, and the USGA will merely continue to
study new developments with an eye on preserving the game's
integrity.
It was both a wise and politic decision because a radical rules
revamping would have created a bifurcated game. Many weekend
golfers would have ignored any ban on game-improvement clubs, which
would have undercut the USGA's ability to rule. Meanwhile,
manufacturers would have buried the USGA in lawsuits, further
debilitating the game's governing authority.
For its part, Callaway has done golf a great service by standing
up for the rights of the game's devotees against overarching
regulators. By helping to convince the USGA to back off its power
trip, it also did the association a favor, whether the USGA
realizes it or not. And last but not least, it provided business a
lesson in how to defend its rights from misguided meddlers, both
private and public.
Since entering the Westchester County market in 1995, Donald
Trump has proposed three golf-course projects. He now may make a
fourth proposal, for property he recently purchased along the
border with Putnam County.
This is Trump's first foray into Putnam County, where on June 10
he paid $1.75 million for 265 acres of rolling hills off Indian
Hill Road in the town of Putnam Valley. A small portion of the
property, about 30 acres, is in Yorktown. The land had been in
foreclosure and was taken over by Bankers Trust Corp.
