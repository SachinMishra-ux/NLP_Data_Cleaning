Franke said it will conduct its own test on the products and
work with the Center for Environmental Health in San Francisco,
which commissioned the study, to ensure its products meet public
health requirements.
Michael Green, executive director of the group, welcomed the
move and said his group's goal is to use the state's anti-toxics
law, Proposition 65, to force other manufacturers to do the same.
The study was conducted for Green's organization by the
Environmental Quality Institute at the University of North Carolina
at Asheville, which has done more than 50 studies of lead in
drinking water.
Lead is the leading environmental threat to children's health.
Even at low levels, lead has been shown to impair fetal
development, cause learning disabilities in children and lead to
miscarriages in pregnant women.
At a news conference Thursday, Green said the group had filed
60-day notices with the state pointing out that four of the
companies are in violation of Proposition 65, the state's
anti-toxics law.
He said the group had filed a lawsuit against a fifth company,
Omni Corp. And a sixth company, Ametek Inc., the leading maker of
home filter systems, has already agreed to remove lead from its
product by November as part of a legal settlement.
In all, the study looked at 16 home water filtration systems
that have separate faucets mounted on a sink and usually have
filters mounted below the sink. The systems range in cost from $100
to $300.
Over a three-week period, the study tested daily lead levels in
water that was left standing in the faucets. Many of the systems
have brass faucets, which contain lead that leaches into water left
in the faucet while it is not being used.
In some cases, the researchers found, the filtering system can
increase the corrosiveness of the water and increase its ability to
leach out lead.
Based on consumption of eight glasses of water a day, the study
showed that a filter made by Omni contained 35.5 parts lead per
billion, and one made by Franke contained 30.1 parts lead per
billion both well above the federal standard of 11 parts per
billion.
