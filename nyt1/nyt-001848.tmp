Elway, looking at himself through the same lens in which all his
teen-age insecurities once were filtered, doesn't think much has
changed in 20 years, except for his hairline.
The Michelangelo David at the front entrance of Caesar's Palace
attracts hordes every day, but is faux. So do the white tigers in
the lobby of the Mirage next door and they, to be sure, are real.
And so, by the way, are the seven Picassos hanging in the same
hotel's top restaurant, Melange. Tap one with your butter knife and
watch how fast the security goons rush in.
The word is out, and it may make you shudder. Las Vegas, the
world capital of temptation and tat, is branching out.
To the familiar sinner's brew of roulette, one-armed bandits and
fast-as-you-like wedding ceremonies, add a new, altogether
unexpected ingredient: fine art and never-before-seen antiquities.
When it opens in October, the Bellagio, conceived by Steve Wynn,
the American gaming tycoon and owner of the Mirage, will be more
than just the latest word in architectural excess, though it has
enough of that.
Meant to evoke the villas of northern Italy, it has its own
mini-Lake Como lapping the Strip, quivering cypress trees and 1,100
tinkling fountains.
In November, the screamingly brash Rio All-Suites and Casino,
just off the Strip, will open its doors to the largest exhibition
of Romanov Dynasty treasures ever to leave the Peterhof
Reserve-Museum in Russia.
For six months, Wedgewood dinner services, a Faberge egg and the
throne of Peter the Great will be among more than 1,000 pieces
displayed in a series of rooms being built in the Casino to
recreate, down to the last detail, the salons and galleries of the
Peterhof itself.
The hard-to-imagine joining of hands between the Rio and the
Peterhof was marked Sunday by an equally unlikely ceremony in St.
Petersburg.
