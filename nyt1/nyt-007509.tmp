But this game hardly had the look of a typical Astros comeback
when Elarton, 22, left with a 5-2 lead and two runners on with one
out in the seventh. Instead of zapping the life out of the young
Reds, the Astros' bullpen resuscitated Cincinnati's hopes by
blowing the lead and putting the offense on call for more
late-inning magic.
Pinch hitters Craig Biggio and Ricky Gutierrez started the
eighth-inning rally. Biggio was hit by a pitch, and Gutierrez
singled, bringing Bill Spiers to the plate to face Rick Krivda
(0-1). Spiers brought Biggio home on a single to right, tying the
score at six.
Righthanded reliever Scott Sullivan got flyouts from Brad Ausmus
and Derek Bell before intentionally walking Jeff Bagwell to bring
Everett to the plate with the bases loaded. Reds manager Jack
McKeon summoned closer Jeff Shaw from the bullpen, but he was no
match for Everett, who is hitting .393 in his last 14 games.
If there was pressure on Elarton, he didn't bother to convey it
to the 24,301 fans, including several family members, who showed up
for his coming-out party. The rookie righthander pitched well
enough to win, holding the Reds to five hits in 6 innings while
striking out nine and walking just one.
Elarton retired 16 of the 25 batters he faced, setting down the
side in order in three innings. Dierker lifted him with the tying
run at the plate, assuring the rookie would get nothing worse than
a no-decision.
So Dierker put Elarton's fate in the hands of the bullpen, which
dropped it like a stick of dynamite. The Reds exploded for four
runs in the seventh, thanks in large part to an overall lack of
control by the Astros' bullpen, which allowed five hits, four runs,
two walks and a hit batsmen in its 2 innings.
Dierker needed three relievers to get out of the seventh inning.
Mike Magnante, who inherited runners at first and second, allowed a
single and bases-loaded walk to the two hitters he faced, and
Reggie Harris walked the only batter who stepped to the plate
against him, forcing in another run. C.J. Nitkowski (3-2), who
pitched a perfect eighth and got the win, allowed an RBI single to
Mike Frank to tie the score and with two out put the Reds ahead 6-5
by hitting Willie Greene with the bases full.
Elarton sat down the first four batters he faced with ease,
changing speeds and spotting the ball like a veteran. Dmitri
Young's second-inning double to center was the Reds' first hit of
the game, and Bret Boone singled him home to give Cincinnati a 1-0
lead.
The Astros put Elarton back in a comfort zone with four runs in
the third. Bell had an RBI single, and Bagwell connected for a
towering three-run homer off Reds starter Brett Tomko. It was
Bagwell's 12th home run of the season and the 199th of his career.
Barry Larkin's solo homer in the fourth brought the Reds within
4-2 before they took the lead during the Astros' seventh-inning
collapse.
