Battery rundown protection is built in: It shuts down the
electrical accessories if any are inadvertently left on after the
engine has been turned off.
Even the windows have been enlarged for greater visibility.
Brighter headlights and backup lights add to the visibility, and
the lights come on automatically when needed.
Five engines are available on the Silverado and Sierra, a V-6
and four V-8s, including a turbodiesel. Here are the choices:
It sounds bad, but consider: America is doing quite well, thank
you. Our robust economic growth, low unemployment and negligible
inflation are the envy of the world.
The observer, incidentally, is Bill Lyons, president and chief
operating officer of American Century Cos. Inc., parent company of
the American Century mutual funds family based in Kansas City.
Lyons no doubt is more acutely aware than most that mutual fund
assets topped $5 trillion this spring. That number is up from about
$300 billion in 1982, a phenomenon that isn't exactly reflective of
a wastrel society.
Put another way, the amount Americans have put into the mutual
fund piggy bank since the early 1980s just about equals the growth
in the national debt during that time. Meanwhile, Washington
collected hundreds of billions of dollars more in Social Security
taxes than it needed to finance benefits and spent the surplus.
What's ironic about the savings summit is that it's being held
in the nation's capital, where more has probably been done to
discourage thrift than any place in America. Nevertheless, Congress
and the White House ordered the confab to encourage Americans to
save more for their retirement.
What's really needed, however, is not so much a talkfest on the
subject but the political embrace of a set of policy measures that
would eliminate the myriad government-created disincentives to
saving in America. The first step should be to eliminate taxation
of the rewards derived when money is saved rather than spent. The
second step would be creation of a dual Social Security track that
would allow taxpayers to save some of their payroll taxes for their
own use in personal retirement accounts.
Another aspect of this issue is the question of whether the
savings problem really is as bad as many claim. Judging from
America's enviable situation, it certainly wouldn't seem so.
Why is this? The method of measuring savings distorts reality.
The rate is determined simply by subtracting national consumption
from after-tax income. This fails to account for the wealth created
by the soaring stock market or the equity buildup being enjoyed by
homeowners. Moreover, there's no way to measure the psychological
deterrent to saving created by Social Security taxes, which have
become a heavier load than the income tax burden for a majority of
taxpayers.
