Although he is a seasoned local politician, Feiner said he was
surprised to discover that running in a national race was almost
entirely about fund raising. Campaigning in a townwide election, he
said, requires more legwork and more handshaking than it does
money.
Feiner, 42, became involved in politics as a campaign volunteer
at 13 (after a rabbi persuaded him, during his bar mitzvah, not to
become a rabbi). He was a Westchester County legislator for eight
years before being elected Greenburgh town supervisor in 1991.
Greenburgh includes villages along the Hudson River from
Hastings-on-Hudson to Tarrytown, as well as Ardsley, Elmsford and
Hartsdale.
If running a national race has been an education, Feiner has
been a difficult student. He is so contemptuous of the money end of
politics that his fund-raising manager and campaign consultant quit
in May, frustrated because he would not follow their advice.
He made lists, as he was advised to do, of everyone who did
business in the Town of Greenburgh developers, real estate
agents, merchants, corporate directors and called them to solicit
support. He listened to the professionals' tactics and then ignored
their suggestions.
For all his fumbling, most people who knew Feiner gave
something. Some wanted something back. The most egregious case
involved a lawyer he met at a fund-raiser who offered cash and an
introduction to important people in Rockland and Orange counties,
where Feiner is little known and his opponent, Gilman, is very
popular.
The lawyer made it clear he wanted to be given town legal work
in exchange for his support. When Feiner balked, the man withdrew
the offer.
So far, hundreds of people in the 20th Congressional District,
which stretches to Rockland, Orange and Sullivan counties, have
contributed a total of $135,000 to Feiner's campaign. It is far
more than the $70,000 he raised for any of his local races, but not
enough to buy the television and radio ads and pay for the mailings
to reach people in the sprawling district.
The opposing campaign agrees. Gilman, 75, is chairman of the
influential International Relations Committee and is seeking his
14th term in Congress. He plans to raise about $600,000, said Sandi
Thoby, controller for Citizens for Gilman.
If Feiner does not raise enough money to win, he can still hope
to run well and position himself for the future, said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion.
Feiner, who is married to a lawyer, Sherrie Brown, got his start
as a political noodge. An avid bicyclist, he badgered the
Westchester County Legislature to create bike lanes along the Bronx
River Parkway until it finally gave in.
