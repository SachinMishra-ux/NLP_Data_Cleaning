Karbaschi is an ally of President Mohammad Khatami, who was
elected last year in an overwhelming protest vote against the
clerical stranglehold in Iran. Whether the mayor embezzled city
accounts as charged may never be known. What is clear is that
Khatami's opponents went after the mayor to weaken Khatami and his
reform program.
Last November, when I boarded an Iran Air jumbo jet for the
flight from Istanbul to Tehran, I thought I was about to traverse a
vast political expanse. The differences of culture, language and
history are indeed great. But after a few days in Tehran, I found
the politics of exclusion and control were not that dissimilar. It
is a pity, for the people of Turkey and Iran have the energy and
heart to fashion democratic societies, if they only had the
chance. 
In 1995, the Mariner turning point came on August 24th against
the Yankees. The M's came back to win and then took off on a molten
tear, stealing the American League West and you know the rest.
For any of the 41,514 fans who stuck around at the Kingdome,
there was an opportunity to feel that same sort of hopeful rush.
After trailing the Dodgers so badly all day, the Mariners sent
the winning run to the plate in the ninth. An injured David Segui
came to pinch hit. He had the bases loaded and the score was 7-4
and you just know Segui, who has three career grand slams and a
fierce competitive drive that makes even Piniella proud, wanted to
smack his team over the top.
But when Segui swung for strike three, the game ended with a
frustrating abruptness, and so did the moment of Mariner optimism.
It left you wondering with considerable good reason what the
remaining 100 games of the season will bring.
What will it take to turn around the 1998 Mariners? What can be
done to salvage a season that has gone from World Series contender
to a disheartening but ever-more-obvious June surrender?
There has to be an answer. There has to be something that can
inject some life, some hope into a club that should not be this
down and out.
Yet, as the losses mount and the season wilts, there is no clue
about what can be done. The silence coming from the Mariners has
grown deafening.
