Pataki and Kessel declined to comment directly about what the
documents disclosed about the compensation entitlements.
On March 25, 1998, opponents of the deal released Bonnifield's
1994 memo on the $10 million-plus golden parachute. In an interview
at that time, Kessel expressed no surprise about the memo. He did
not argue, as he does now, that such payments were prohibited, nor
did he indicate any plans to try to stop them.
Kessel now says he does not recall why he did not take a
militant stance in March and April against the planned Lilco
payments.
WALDO, Fla. -- Jim Hooten stood under the 100-year-old oak trees
that tower over his modest wood frame house, watching a wall of
orange flames rage through the dense stand of pines that grows
nearly to his back door.
Within minutes, he feared, his house and all he had worked for
would be gone, consumed by the latest wave of wildfires that have
swept across nearly 50,000 acres of bone-dry Florida the past
month. Scattered showers Thursday night and Friday weakened the
fires but did little to end the dangerous drought conditions.
By Saturday, the fires in 34 of Florida's 67 counties had
destroyed about 12,000 acres of timber worth an estimated $10
million, injured at least 14 people and killed one person, damaged
about 80 buildings and 65 vehicles, and left at least 1,000 people
temporarily homeless. Across the line in Georgia, wildfires had
burned another 13,600 acres, including an estimated $14 million
worth of timber, near the Okefenokee Swamp.
A half-mile away, Tammy Nichols and several other members of a
Florida Division of Forestry firefighting team were working
frantically to make sure that didn't happen.
A mile away from the firefighters at Waldo City Hall, Mayor
Louie Davis, City Councilmember Rodney Estes and City Manager Lee
Vincent came to the sobering realization that the fire just might
consume their entire town, burning the homes and businesses of the
1,100 residents.
It was Wednesday afternoon, and they had just ordered the second
evacuation of Waldo in as many days. Fortunately, most of the
residents on the side of town nearest the blaze heeded the warnings
and left. Most went to stay with family or friends or to motels in
nearby Gainesville.
By 3 p.m., winds were gusting out of the southwest at nearly 20
mph. The fire was raging dangerously close to a half-dozen
residences, and if it managed to cross a paved road on the town's
outskirts, quaint, sleepy Waldo would likely burn to cinders. The
flames would be fueled by the clapboards of the town's rustic,
wood-sided homes and the hardwood trees that shadow its streets.
