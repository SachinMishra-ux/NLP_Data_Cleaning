Presley's commentary came from the dugout, making it impossible
for anyone at Coors Field to know anything was said. Nonetheless,
Quick, ejected Presley, who then jumped onto the field and let the
veteran umpire know, face to face, what he thought of the strike
zone.
Talk frankly with anyone involved in the major leagues, and one
common subject arises the lack of accountability of big-league
umpires.
Once a person becomes a major league umpire, it's the equivalent
of being named a Supreme Court justice; if you want the job, it's
yours for life. Try to name the last umpire who was fired?
Until American and National League Presidents Gene Budig and Len
Coleman, respectively, decide to truly take control of the umpiring
the charade will continue.
Baseball is the only sport that does not use the merit system to
reward its best officials for use in the playoffs, preferring to
use a rotation basis where every umpire works the postseason once
his turn comes up.
The NBA selects its best referees for the playoffs. The NBA also
gets rid of its two or three worst referees after every season,
which alone should get every referee to be at his best every night.
Players are not forbidden from criticizing umpires, but know
that if they do, they can expect to be branded by the close-knit
fraternity of umpires.
In the NBA, a player can talk with a referee and even get this disagree in a civil manner without worrying about being ejected.
Not so in baseball, where nearly every umpire views any
disagreement as a question of integrity.
It's an age-old problem in baseball but one that seems to be
getting worse with each season. The gap between umpires and
managers/players seems to be growing.
Baseball needs to realize a real problem exists. The leagues can
make a stand to take control of the umpiring.
