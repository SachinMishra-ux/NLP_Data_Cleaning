The convention was in almost every sense different from the
convention of four years ago, when D'Amato's forces battled to the
last minute to prevent Pataki, then a little-known state senator
from Peekskill, from facing a primary for the nomination to
challenge Gov. Mario Cuomo.
William Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, read from a
script on the lectern, leading the state committee through the
motions of ratifying a slate that was selected long before any
state committee members checked in at the Sheraton New York Hotel
and Towers in Manhattan.
Pataki then offered the outlines of what is shaping up, at least
in contrast to four years ago, as an unadventurous re-election
strategy. He described his accomplishments of the past four years,
in particular cutting taxes, pushing for environmental protections
and restoring the death penalty. But he offered little insight into
what he might do if re-elected, other than pushing for more tax
cuts.
By design, the day was supposed to be devoid of drama, so that
all attention was directed at Pataki. But Giuliani, who has long
had a competitive relationship with the governor and who is likely
to compete further on the national stage, turned the dynamic with
his speech, which included a lengthy recital of his own
accomplishments as mayor.
Giuliani's welcoming speech was a minute longer than Pataki's
acceptance speech. Asked how long Giuliani's speech was supposed to
be, Zenia Mucha, the governor's communications director, held up
five fingers, and glanced with exasperation at the stage.
Giuliani's remarks bought a measure of disorder to a convention
clearly intended to be orderly. Reporters were relegated to a
separate part of the room and kept away from delegates.
Pataki/Donohue placards were neatly placed on every chair as the
delegates entered the room Thursday morning. A news release that
was issued before the gavel was dropped announced that Pataki had
been unanimously chosen. The schedule even announced when the red,
white and blue balloons hanging over the room would be dropped (at
4 p.m. Thursday).
Pataki, as is his practice, sought to glide above the politics
swirling around him, instead laying out themes of his campaign in
his speech. The Democratic candidate will be chosen in a primary
this September.
The governor painted a dark picture of New York under Democratic
control, and asserted that Republican policies had turned things
around. He recalled being a member of the Assembly, pushing for tax
cuts, reductions in the welfare rolls and the elimination of some
regulations.
NEW YORK As they stood together on the thick carpet of City
Hall for the swearing-in ceremony a few days ago the father a
legendary retired justice, the son just about to ascend to the
bench it seemed to be a storybook moment of generational passage.
The son recalled the moment 30 years before when his father took
the oath, and even talked explicitly about the path of his father's
footsteps. The father beamed.
But modern storybooks are rarely so pat, and it is clear that
the footsteps of Gregory Carro, a newly minted judge of the New
York City Criminal Court, will be his own, not be those of his
well-known father.
