Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling and most do they're
no longer functioning.
The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.
But you don't really have anything to feel guilty about. Your
husband is the one who needs to unclench and join the rest of us
here in the late '90s. For millions of people, online chat has
replaced street-corner chatter and backyard-fence gossip. And, when
you consider that the guy on the other side of the fence may well
be Norman Bates, it's a heck of a lot safer as long as you use some
common sense: Don't give out your phone number or address, and
don't ever meet anybody you chat with in real life unless you do it
in a public place and drag a couple of your friends along. Oh, and
prepare to be disappointed, because in a chat room nobody is who
they say they are, and if they are, well, they're probably lying
about something else. That's OK. You can be whomever you want, too.
Some people might think it's unhealthy to be friends with
strangers from around the world instead of your own neighbors. But,
really now, what do I have in common with a lunatic saxophone
player who puts ceramic chickens and one of those stupid windsocks
in his front yard? I'd much rather talk to Mandy, the 19-year-old
supermodel from Argentina, about quantum physics, geopolitical
economic strategy and interesting things you can do with Jell-O. At
least she says she's a supermodel. For all I know I'm talking with
Margaret Thatcher. Where's the harm?
