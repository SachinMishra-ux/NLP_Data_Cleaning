HARTFORD, Conn. When George Perry caught his world record
22-pound-6-ounce bass nearly 70 years ago, he won a national
fishing contest sponsored by Field Stream. The fish he pulled
from Montgomery Lake, Ga., in 1932 won him $75. That amount is
$999,925 less than the winners took home at a four-day bass
tournament that concluded Saturday along the banks of the
Connecticut River.
Called the Forrest Wood Open, part of the Wal-Mart FLW Tour, the
contest marked the richest bass-fishing event in history, complete
with elimination rounds, television coverage and enough corporate
sponsors to rival the Olympics. Prizes ranged from $200,000 for
first place in the professional division, which was won by Randall
Hutson of Washburn, Mo., with a five-fish limit weighing in at 8
pounds 6 ounces, to $40,000 for the amateur division, which was won
by Frank Free of Buford, Ga., with a five-fish limit weighing 6
pounds 11 ounces.
In a separate category, bass pro Denny Brauer of Camdenton, Mo.,
gathered the most points and won the right to have his face adorn a
box of Wheaties.
By Friday, after two elimination rounds, only 10 boats and 20
anglers remained from the original field of 300 men. In bass
tournaments, each boat is teamed with a professional and an
amateur, but catches are scored separately. Total daily weight
determines who advances and, ultimately, who wins the top prizes.
Unlike George Perry, who reportedly caught his fish using $4
worth of tackle (including the makeshift boat he assembled with 75
cents worth of scrap lumber), a tournament bass angler lugs enough
gear to warrant a second mortgage.
At precisely 6 o'clock, each boat roared away from the dock,
then wound and twisted its way beneath Bulkeley and Founders
Bridges in downtown Hartford at speeds more suitable for a James
Bond movie than a fishing contest.
Over the next hour, most anglers had settled into their
respective spots. Bass pro Randy Howell of Littleton, N.C.,
relentlessly cast into a single concrete culvert no more than 30
feet wide to eke out two little smallmouth by the 2 p.m. deadline.
He earned $23,000 for his eight-hour shift, but was eliminated from
the next day's competition.
Three boats fished an oxbow in the river called Chapman Pond,
some 30 miles south of Hartford. Among them was an old-time pro
named Basil Bacon of Springfield, Mo.
Bacon carefully made his way along the edge of a submerged weed
bed, methodically slipping a plastic jig into tiny pockets. A
scarlet tananger sang in the woods. Except for the television crew
taping his every move some 30 feet away, it seemed like the perfect
image of bass fishing, far from the hype and endless promotion of
the fishing shows.
An hour passed with no fish taken. An osprey soared into view,
spent a minute surveying the situation, then matter-of-factly
plunged into the pond coming up with a largemouth, weight
undetermined. It flew to a nearby dead tree and promptly ate its
catch.
