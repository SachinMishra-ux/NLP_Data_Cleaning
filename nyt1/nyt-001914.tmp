Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.
An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.
