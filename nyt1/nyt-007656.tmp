In the 40th minute, with Claudio Reyna giving him far too much
room, Iran's Hamid Estili headed a ball over the head of American
goalkeeper Kasey Keller to give his team a 1-0 lead. As the crowd
of 35,500, made largely of Iranian fans, erupted, Estili kissed the
ground in celebration.
Six minutes from the game's conclusion, Mehdi Mahdavikia
sprinted past the disheveled American defense and blasted another
goal past Keller. McBride provided an inconsequential goal on a
header for the Americans in the 87th minute.
Today, as about 2 million tourists each year bustle down the
mile-long stretch of seafood bars, candy stores and souvenir shops
that line the historic row, any such fragile grub would be unlikely
to slither its way into open air on its own.
The noise of honky-tonks, whorehouses, crowded groceries,
saloons and flophouses has long been replaced by the sound of
cameras taking pictures, the laughter of children and the din of
construction jackhammers. Where sardine fishing and canning once
supplied a vibrant economy, tourism now pulls in 50 percent of the
city's annual revenue.
It is the very success of Monterey's flourishing tourist
industry, supported in large part by the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
that concerns literary buffs and preservationists. They say that
new development, including a four-story shopping plaza planned for
the center of the row, threatens the last vestiges of the old life.
On June 15, the National Trust for Historic Preservation agreed,
and named Cannery Row as one of the nation's 11 most-endangered
historic places. The National Trust is a private nonprofit
organization headquartered in Washington that was chartered by
Congress to monitor historic sites.
Albert said the city recently purchased Doc Rickett's Lab, which
appears in Steinbeck's book and is one of two historically
designated buildings on the row, for $400,000. He said the city
also spent nearly $2 million to make the new aquarium maintain the
aesthetic feel of a cannery that once stood in its place. In
addition, Albert said the city plans to add markers to point out
important buildings throughout the row, and has begun a survey of
81 structures in the area to determine if they are historical.
Although the city does not own much of the property on the row,
Albert said that officials are trying to balance conservation
efforts with private property interests by offering tax incentives
to developers to preserve the existing structures or to design
buildings that retain the texture of the old canning district.
Cannery Row first came to the attention of the National Trust
for Historic Preservation last year, during a battle over the fate
of the San Xavier Warehouse, one of the few remaining buildings
with a direct link to the canning industry. City officials deemed
it a safety hazard, and property owners wanted it gone, but local
preservationists held firm. In the end, the city ordered property
owners not to demolish the warehouse, but to take it apart piece by
piece so that parts of it could be re-used in construction.
Frustrated by the city's planning process during the battle,
Neal Hotelling, one of the preservationists, nominated Cannery Row
for National Trust's annual listing of endangered places.
