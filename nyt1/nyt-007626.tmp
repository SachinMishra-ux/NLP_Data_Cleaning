Six minutes later, Klinsmann rose high in a German wall and took
a Mihajlovic free kick in the side of the chest. He dropped to the
ground and stayed there in a semi-conscious state as team doctors
sprinted to his side. The game would continue, but Klinsmann's role
in it had ended.
It was a day for German recoveries, and though they still share
the lead in Group F, the Germans did not share the Yugoslavs' pain
as they left Lens and began preparing to face Iran.
Austria, which is 78 percent Catholic, is a prosperous country
swept by the kind of religious disaffection and dissent that runs
throughout Western Europe and the United States and that that is
the bane of John Paul II's pontificate in his twilight years.
On his three-day visit, which ended Sunday, the pope's three
Masses were eagerly attended by believers, but the crowds were
small and restrained compared with the vast and jubilant seas of
humanity that greeted him on recent trips to Nigeria and Cuba, poor
nations hungry for the solace and attention of the bishop of Rome.
As he delivered his homilies, he made clear that his opposition
to issues dear to reformers has not wavered. And perhaps most
emphatically, he told the bishops of Austria, who are also divided
along ideological lines, to shape up.
The pope's remarks followed a highly public comment by one
bishop that had already riveted Austrian Catholics. At a mass
Saturday in the small town of St. Poelton, its conservative bishop,
Kurt Krenn, departed from his prepared text and offered a prayer
for Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was forced to resign in 1995
amid allegations that he sexually molested young men in a monastery
20 years ago.
The scandal, which re-erupted in January after a priest made
fresh charges, was so politically stormy among Catholics that
Groer's successor, Schoenborn, announced in April that the charges
were true and apologized for Groer's actions.
Krenn, however, remained loyal to Groer, and dismissed the
priest who made his own accusation of sexual abuse by Groer public.
Demonstrators outside the mass Saturday carried black balloons to
signal their unhappiness with Krenn.
Even Austrians who are not actively practicing Catholics have
followed the Groer affair and Krenn's prayer for him in St. Poelton
was mentioned on most newscasts here.
Schoenborn, who is as conservative as the pope on doctrinal
issues, has sought to make peace within Austria's church by
engaging in dialogue with Catholic dissidents. He invited leaders
of one of the more prominent lay groups, We Are the Church, to sit
in the VIP section at Sunday's outdoor mass on Vienna's Heroes'
Square. They thanked him for the invitation but declined to attend
in protest against what they view as the pope's resistance to
reforms.
