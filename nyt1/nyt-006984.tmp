For example, Murdoch, the son of a relatively small-time
Australian newspaper proprietor, was snubbed at his exclusive
English boarding schools and made to feel the unworthy outsider as
a boy. Thus, while he is politically conservative, Murdoch sees
himself as anti-establishment and has a me-against-the-world
attitude. He is, in Auletta's opinion, driven as much by personal
animus as by political agendas.
Still, Auletta rakes Murdoch for taking the BBC World Service
off his Star TV satellite network in China because the Beijing
government thought the BBC was too critical of China. He also takes
Murdoch to task for publishing a flattering biography hagiography, actually of Beijing's late paramount leader, Deng
Xiaoping, written by Deng's daughter for Murdoch's HarperCollins.
WACO, Texas I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Bird look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
