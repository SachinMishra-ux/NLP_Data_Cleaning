Daal gave Bichette more than credit in the Rockies' half of the
sixth. He gave him a good pitch to hit. Bichette hit a two-run
homer to left to make the score 5-2. 
SALT LAKE CITY Madness has become a way of life, a fishbowl of
groupies, microphones, leeches and distractions that would sink any
other outfit.
Until Wednesday, it had never reached the basketball floor. But
for the first time since Michael Jordan climbed the mountain, the
Bulls show signs of cracking.
After the Jazz squeezed out a victory in Game 1, fingers were
flying in all directions. Jordan blamed Scottie Pippen for not
knowing the play on a crucial 24-second violation. He said Luc
Longley acted like a 6-foot-5 guard. And in a snit of pretzel
logic, Pippen was angry that Longley deflected a pass, thereby
destroying his rhythm on an errant three-point shot that ended the
game.
There were signs of doubt entering the Finals. Strange words
never before heard from the defending champions. Jordan said he
could handle his career ending in defeat. Dennis Rodman said the
Bulls still would be winners even if they lose this series. Pippen
talked openly about being the underdog. In sum, it sounded very
much like reconciliation and resignation of the inevitable.
But the most telling moment occurred Wednesday, when Jordan
openly berated Pippen for not passing him the ball . . . after his
teammate nailed a three-pointer to tie the score. After the ensuing
timeout, Pippen rebelliously launched another three-pointer.
On Thursday, a bleary-eyed Rodman made it to practice on time
and the Bulls were trying to heal themselves. Jackson complained
that newspapers seem to print unflattering pictures of the Bulls
coach, so he smiled like a model, inviting a group photo shoot. And
when asked whether Pippen took an ill-advised three-pointer late in
the game, Pippen stuck his head through a curtain.
So Pippen and Jordan not only denied any bickering but laughed
like there wasn't a care in the world.
The Bulls know another defeat in Game 2 could be fatal. If they
lose again, they would have to win four of five games. Certainly
possible, except they've lost four of their past six.
Still, this is group that always comes through in moments like
this, prevailing when they are most vulnerable, when the madness
becomes a monsoon. But it has to end sometime.
