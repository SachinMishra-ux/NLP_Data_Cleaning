Earlier on Thursday, Shelby warned the administration to honor
its promise to cooperate with the inquiry and not hide behind the
Justice Department's investigation.
Senior Justice Department officials said on Thursday that Tenet
was initially told not to talk to senators about certain
information because the disclosure could hamper the federal
investigation of the satellite company, Loral Space and
Communications of New York.
An administration official said on Thursday night that the
information Tenet refused to discuss was a CIA assessment of the
incident that led to the Loral inquiry. A similar report by the
Pentagon concluded last year that American national security was
harmed by the information passed on to the Chinese.
Thursday's three-hour closed hearing with Tenet marked the
opening round of months of hearings by several House and Senate
committees into whether China learned secret information from
American satellites that Beijing then used to aim its nuclear
missiles more accurately.
Shelby's committee is leading the investigation in the Senate.
The House plans to create a select committee to handle its separate
inquiry.
A federal grand jury is investigating whether Loral and another
satellite maker, Hughes Electronics, a Los Angeles division of the
General Motors Corp., illegally gave China space expertise that
allowed Beijing to more accurately aim its nuclear missiles. 
Loral's chairman and chief executive, Bernard Schwartz, was the
largest personal contributor to the Democratic National Committee
last year. Schwartz has denied he sought any favors in exchange for
his contributions.
While there are many strands to the various Congressional
inquiries, federal and congressional investigators are focusing on
the events following the Feb. 15, 1996, explosion seconds after a
Chinese rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellite was
launched.
After the explosion, China asked the two American companies to
conduct an independent review of the accident. The team was led by
Loral, but included experts from Hughes. 
Administration officials say the American experts overstepped
the boundaries of what they could tell the Chinese during the
review. The State Department asked the Defense Technology Security
Administration in the Pentagon to investigate.
