Now, though, Russia's ability to squeeze more income from oil
depends on whether OPEC can agree to raise prices by cutting
production at its next meeting, later this month in Vienna,
Austria. Russia plans to send a representative to the meeting, and
is considering joining OPEC.
In advance of the meeting, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela agreed on
Thursday with Mexico, which is not a member, to cut their
production by 450,000 barrels a day. Those three nations led a
coalition that managed to win agreement for production cuts last
March, temporarily buoying prices.
Instead, to raise cash, the government has sought to privatize
some of the industry. But prices for domestic oil companies proved
just as disappointing as the price of oil. The government tried to
get $2.1 billion for RAO Rosneft, a huge energy company, but found
no interested buyers; it recently had to drop the asking price to
$1.6 billion to attract bids.
Russian oil-industry executives, who were flexing political
muscles at home and in neighboring nations a year or two ago when
oil fetched $18 to $20 a barrel, are on the defensive, pleading for
government help with tax cuts and lower pipeline fees.
They are in a bind. Antiquated equipment at the wellhead makes
trimming production a one-way proposition at many wells; once they
are shut down, it would be very expensive to restart them. But at
current oil prices, many of the same wells lose money on every
barrel.
Unless OPEC and other major producers can agree to make another
production cut, like one agreed upon in March, many analysts say
oil prices may fall further, adding to the burdens of the economy.
Russia exports about 25 percent of its output of about 6.2
million barrels a day, yielding 45 percent of the country's
foreign-currency income. Production peaked in 1988, when most
Eastern European countries were still captive customers, at 11.4
million barrels a day, but in the collapse of communism the next
year, output fell by nearly half.
Domestic energy prices in Russia are still somewhat shielded
from world market trends, so the Russian oil industry has begun
looking more toward domestic markets to help ride out the downturn.
But ruble sales don't help refill government coffers with hard
currency.
Robert Ebel, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a research group in Washington, said Russian
production increased slightly last year, mostly because of
increasing investment by Western oil companies. But a lack of legal
guarantees for foreigners has restricted the amounts that Western
companies have been willing to commit to expand production further.
NEW YORK Nothing in the classical music world offers as much
room for parody as opera. The repertory itself, packed as it is
with implausible plots and peculiar characters, offers ample
material, and there is even more to skewer in the practical side of
the business, where the grandiose egos of divas, directors and
conductors to say nothing of the fervent partisanship of their
fans can be mistaken for parody by dispassionate outsiders.
