Why not? To protect everyone involved, athletic commissions
across the nation should require that test results be submitted a
month before !ital!major!off! fights or no license. Simple as that.
If that means a foreign fighter must fly into the United States
solely to take the test, so be it. Again, it would serve everyone including that fighter.
However, the Holyfield-Akinwande fight was made months ago. Even
without appropriate policies, the fighters could've should've! had their tests in long ago. Holyfield's were submitted weeks ago,
Petrillo said, while Akinwande (who fights out of Orlando, Fla.)
was tested Tuesday.
In Akinwande's case, the disease was at the infectious stage,
according to a doctor who studied the fighter's blood sample.
Without testing, it seems, Holyfield would've been at risk. At the
same time, all those who have worked closely with Akinwande including sparring partners !ital!were!off! at risk.
Well, if the powers that be are smart, they will after this. And
that includes California, which might want to test more frequently.
Looking forward: Oscar De La Hoya, who defends his WBC
welterweight title against unknown Frenchman Patrick Charpentier on
Saturday in El Paso, Texas, reiterated his desire to fight Felix
Trinidad in what would be an attractive non-heavyweight bout.
Arum, his promoter, said he met with Trinidad's handlers last
week. However, these are the early stages of negotiations.
Arum said he might be willing to guarantee Trinidad more money
than De La Hoya, but De La Hoya would get a percentage of the
profits.
Trinidad claims he no longer is under contract to promoter Don
King, but Arum said that's not so clear, which complicates
negotiations but isn't necessarily an insurmountable obstacle.
Helen Carter, a singer and musician who was part of the Carter
family dynasty of country-music entertainers, died on Tuesday at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. She was 70
and lived in Dickson, Tenn.
She had been hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems that
began over a year ago, said Kelly Hancock of House of Cash, the
business office of Johnny Cash, Mrs. Carter's brother-in-law, and
of her sister June Carter Cash.
