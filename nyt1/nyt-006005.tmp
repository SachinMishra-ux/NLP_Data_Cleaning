After spending four years as an assistant coach in Phoenix,
Westphal took over the Suns and led them to the 1993 NBA Finals.
Phoenix lost the title to the Bulls, but won 62 games that year.
Westphal won 56 and 59 games the next two seasons.
An injury-plagued season amid high expectations did in Westpahl.
Phoenix was 14-19 when the Suns fired him. Westphal, though, is
getting a second chance because of his association with Walker and
his established record. He also is a good communicator who can
balance relationships with management and players.
Westphal's system will cater to Payton with uptempo offensive
sets. Westphal will occasionally trap and double-team on defense unlike Karl, whose constant double teams hurt the Sonics in the
playoffs.
Ultimately, without a shot at Jackson, Walker saw Westphal as
the best choice. Hill blew his chances by publicly campaigning for
the job. Silas and Weiss, both former Sonic players, were
considered risks because of unsuccessful stints as head coaches.
The Sonics felt they had to replace a proven winner with a
proven winner, which is why they will name Westphal as their next
head coach.
The surprise isn't that Tiger Woods was walking around the
Olympic Club during a U.S. Open practice round Tuesday with four
uniformed police officers. The surprise was that he couldn't walk
around without them.
People need to get close, to feel the flames. They need an
autograph or a glance or a brush of a sleeve. They need him to make
them a memory or maybe some cash.
Woods is beyond golf, into another realm. Movie stars stay
hidden behind locked gates or tinted glass, emerging only in
virtual form. Woods is out there, among the people. With most
golfers, being among the people is a treat. For Woods, it's an
occupational hazard.
Everyone says Woods' charisma and race have transformed golf
into something more accessible to the people, but that's just the
start of it. Perhaps his most impressive act has been turning golf
into a contact sport.
San Francisco police officer Rich McNaughton drew Tiger duty
Tuesday, and you would think the assignment would be a chance for
an officer to take a break from mediating man's more heinous
endeavors. Instead, he got to see a moving cluster of human
weakness.
