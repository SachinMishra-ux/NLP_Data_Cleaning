The two great women empresses who ruled Russia in the 18th
century, Elizabeth and Catherine the Great, turned the capital into
a glittering stage set. There was misery backstage, though all
those millions of people living in poverty and ignorance. The
nightmare of their hopelessness found expression in the writing of
Gogol.
Music and film are Billington's focus for the third and final
episode, Moussorgsky and Eisenstein his stars. While Tchaikovksy
and other composers were looking toward the West, Moussorgsky was
peering deep into the Russian soul. It's perhaps this search for
the most Russian examples of Russian art, especially art linked to
Russian history, that leads Billington to devote precious time to
realist artists like Ilya Repin, painter of impoverished peasants,
and to all but ignore great movements like Constructivism.
While he doesn't come out and say that the Russia of today is a
mess, neither does Billington try to construct a happy ending for
his series. Near the end is a particularly dismal image. In front
of the palaces of the Hermitage, one of the world's most glorious
architectural ensembles, is a giant inflatable plastic toy palace,
for people to bounce on.
Since then, the U.S. armed forces have been downsized
dramatically and stretched thin as they have been dispatched to
trouble spots around the globe. But the civil-military programs
have continued, despite questions about how carefully they have
been monitored.
Although most projects have been short-range, low-budget items,
a major exception can be found on remote Annette Island in
southwestern Alaska. There, four branches of the armed services are
at work on a five-year project costing at least $20 million to
build 14 miles of gravel road, which the state has promised to pave
later for an estimated $15 million. The road will connect the tiny
Tsimshian Indian village of Metlakatla, population 1,600, to the
landing site for a planned ferry service that would be less than a
mile to the mainland, compared to the 15-mile trip now.
This town on the only Indian reservation in the state had
unsuccessfully lobbied the federal and state governments for
decades to build the road, until they hooked up with the Department
of Defense. There they had a crucial ally in Sen. Ted Stevens, a
Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee and its
defense subcommittee, making him the most powerful senator when it
comes to deciding how the Pentagon will spend money. Moreover,
Stevens is famous for steering federal dollars in the direction of
his home state.
The Alaska road project, costing more than $5 million last year,
consumed nearly one-third of the $16 million annual budget for
civil-military projects for all states. But Raffetto bristled at
the suggestion that the project was pork-barrel spending for a road
that will easily cost $22,000 per island resident.
Operation Alaska Road has required a major logistics effort,
including building a base camp of 37 buildings to house and feed
300 persons, including the National Guard and reservists from as
far away as Missouri and Massachusetts, who are shuttled in and out
on two-week shifts for their annual training exercise.
Already the undertaking has brought in 850 Marines, who spent 23
days on ships sailing to and from the island from their base in San
Diego. Bringing in heavy equipment, including a rock crusher,
five-ton dump trucks and a bulldozer, required three deliveries by
the military's biggest plane, the C-5 Galaxy. The planes flew in
from a National Guard base in New York at a cost of $12,605 per
flight hour, not counting the expense for the seven-member crew.
