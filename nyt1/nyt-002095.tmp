Developer Murray Goodman, who owns the Neiman's site, also agree
to donate 19,000 square feet of land for a park at the southwest
corner of Peruvian Avenue and South County Road. A 20-space parking
lot on Peruvian also will be replaced with a park.
Architects trimmed 8,400-square feet from the original plans,
promised valet parking and will pay for an extra police officer in
the area from November through April to handle traffic.
In addition, Neiman's customers will park free, and others will
pay 15 percent less than at a lot at the western end of Worth
Avenue during the winter season.
The Palm Beach Neiman's will advertise only in publications that
circulate on the island and will mail only to zip code 33480, an
area that includes Palm Beach and South Palm Beach.
No other Palm Beach store is restricted from advertising in The
Palm Beach Post, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel or on television,
but Councilman Leslie Shaw wants the council to consider such
conditions for other major stores as well.
Town planning consultant William Brisson said the store would
have less traffic and cover less space than a group of small stores
on the same site.
Wade, a Texas AM senior from Elgin, rolled his eyes and took a
deep sigh after crossing first at the NCAA outdoor track and field
championships.
The Texas women had another good day of qualifying, advancing
Vaughn in the high hurdles, LaKeisha Backus and Kim McGruder in the
100, Suziann Reid and Toya Brown in the 400 and their 1,600 relay.
Elizabeth Diaz failed to advance in the 1,500 when her time of 4
minutes, 22.18 seconds missed the cutoff by one spot.
Wagner, the University of Texas' defending NCAA outdoor high
jump champion, concluded an injury-plagued junior season by failing
to clear the opening height at this year's meet. For Wagner, it was
a fitting end.
Wagner's training partner, Mark Boswell, also was disappointed.
The UT freshman had the nation's top leap entering the competition
(7 feet, 6 inches), but could clear only 7-0 1/2 recently to finish
tied for 10th.
