Arthur Schlesinger Jr., an acclaimed historian who served in the
administration of President John F. Kennedy, opined in Newsweek
that everything might have been different.
Kennedy aficionados such as Schlesinger believe that an RFK
presidency would have saved the nation and the world from many of
the terrible things that occurred in his absence: the continuing
Vietnam War; the continuing cycle of poverty and despair;
paralyzing scandal and the growth of public cynicism about
government and politics ...
That's speculation, of course. Others might speculate that
President Bobby Kennedy would have presided over an unbridled
expansion of the welfare state; a debilitating dismantling of the
national defense; the undermining of America's health-care system
through the imposition of socialized medicine; and, last but not
least, the long-term strangulation of the nation's economy
resulting from Kennedy's voracious appetite for taxing and
spending.
We haven't read much about such possibilities in the media
because the media remain mesmerized by the Kennedy mystique. Never
let facts stand in the way of a good story: If cruel fate hadn't
intervened, one of the Kennedy brothers would have led us to the
promised land.
Sounds like fantasy land to me, but maybe I'm one of those
cynics who would have been spared the anguish of cynicism if only
Bobby had ascended to the throne. Maybe I'm too cynical to
understand what might have been.
On the other hand, I wasn't cynical at all back in 1968 as I
geared up for my first vote in a presidential election. As a
first-time voter, I was in the market for an idealist to vote for.
I figured my best hope was Eugene McCarthy, who stepped up to
the plate and took on Lyndon B. Johnson in the New Hampshire
primary while RFK lurked in the shadows, agonizing over the hazards
of challenging the incumbent president of his own party. Kennedy
didn't throw his hat into the ring until McCarthy demonstrated
Johnson's vulnerability by nearly pulling off a gigantic upset in
New Hampshire.
It must be noted that all the projections about what Kennedy
might have achieved are based on the premise that he would have
been president that he would have won his party's nomination and
defeated Richard Nixon in the general election. Neither of these
eventualities was anywhere close to the foregone conclusion that
Schlesinger and others would have us believe.
But what if Bobby had become president? Would he have saved the
world, as Schlesinger believes? Or would he have left the world a
bigger mess than he found it, as his detractors would suggest?
Personally, I'd be inclined to lean toward the bigger-mess
theory. But who knows?
