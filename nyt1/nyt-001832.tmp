You must pay income taxes on your traditional IRA when you
withdraw the money, either years from now in retirement or
immediately if you convert to a Roth.
All three companies assume that if you convert today, you will
move your entire IRA balance to a Roth and pay the taxes from some
other source. But they track that side fund for tax payments in
different ways.
T. Rowe Price assumes that if you convert, you will take the
money from taxable savings, and that if you do not convert, that
the taxable savings account will continue to grow in tandem with
your IRA and at the same rate as the IRA, minus taxes.
Strong Funds just ignores the taxable savings account in its
analysis, though it does refer to it in its fine print without
calculating the financial impact.
Byron Vielehr, Strong's vice president for electronic
distribution, said that was done to avoid raising other complex
issues like capital gains taxes that may be due if the taxes are
paid from the proceeds of selling appreciated securities.
Gordon Goodfellow, a retirement specialist at Watson Wyatt
Worldwide, a compensation consultancy, said T. Rowe Price's
technique was the best because it compared apples with apples for
both strategies.
Joseph Mintz, a semi-retired Dallas insurance agent and consumer
advocate who for 30 years has pressed banks, insurers and the
Internal Revenue Service to make fuller disclosures about how they
do their calculations, said that using any technique but the one
adopted by T. Rowe Price made it impossible to compare on an annual
basis whether you would benefit more from sticking with your
traditional IRA or converting to a Roth.
