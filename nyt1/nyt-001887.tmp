The mayor would serve as the arbitrator when the interests of
two districts conflict, with the mayor's decision subject to
ratification by the Metropolitan Council, which could override on a
two-thirds vote.
Answering concerns about anti-development neighborhood boards,
Fleming proposed the incentive of having new tax revenue generated
by development staying with the district.
He cited the economic boom in Burbank, in the San Fernando
Valley, as an example of what could happen if each of the 15
districts benefits from rising tax revenue generated by new
development.
While the 15 districts reflect the current number of council
districts, boundaries would be reconfigured to reflect communities
and shared interests.
VICA leaders said the plan is very similar to their proposal of
a system of elected town councils with decision-making powers.
The Fleming proposal is also similar to an idea advanced by
elected Charter Reform Commission member Paula Boland. She was not
at the forum, but attorney Rob Glushon of suburban Encino, another
member of the city's elected charter panel, said he is open to
Fleming's concept.
Brain was skeptical about whether the proposal will be accepted
either by the Charter Reform Commissions or the City Council.
Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said she is concerned that some
parts of the city would have more development, new tax money and
better services than others.
Fleming said his proposal would require that all areas of the
city retain, at a minimum, their current levels of services and
revenue.
Goldberg favors local councils with decision-making power on
land-use issues and access to a small pot of money, about $250,000,
to spend on local priorities.
