The downtown metropolitan government would continue to provide
centralized police, fire, public works and other services for the
whole city, but the local districts would be free to shop from a
menu of services.
As an incentive to development, local districts would be able to
keep revenue generated by their decisions for enhancing their
neighborhoods.
Fleming, who has avoided direct comment as the elected and
appointed Charter Reform Commissions grappled and often stumbled in
different directions, chose as a forum for his proposal a major
meeting on charter reform sponsored by the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association.
With his longtime leadership roles in the VICA, the Economic
Alliance of the Valley and numerous civic and philanthropic
organizations, Fleming long has been regarded as the unofficial
mayor of the Valley.
His proposal was well-received by VICA and other Valley leaders
who have been debating endorsement of similar proposals, but others
outside the Valley rejected Fleming's ideas outright.
Sam Bell, who heads the Los Angeles Business Advisors, said
downtown business leaders would actively oppose any system of local
councils with power to decide planning matters.
Bell said the group of prominent downtown corporation leaders
wants to expand the City Council from 15 to 33 or 35 members, but
opposes empowered neighborhood councils.
Fleming, however, said he would transfer significant powers to
the 15 district boards, including authority to set locations and
hours for local parks and libraries, deciding which trees to trim
and streets to repair, and regulating street vending and signs.
Each district could contract with the metropolitan government
for local services, but they could also put tax-increase measures
on the district ballot to improve services in their area.
Fleming's charter would contain a doctrine of regional supremacy
that would allow citywide interests to take precedence over local
ones. For instance, a district near Los Angeles International
Airport could not shut down the facility if it conflicted with the
citywide policy.
