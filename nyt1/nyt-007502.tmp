Since the Bush visit, China has developed commodities markets
and stock exchanges. Satellite dishes are everywhere. So are
personal agendas, personal computers, personal trainers, and almost
anything that stresses individual, not communal, growth.

6-foot-tall yellow bird and his Mandarin-speaking pals.

Azteca pyramids, sweaty and exhausted, and thanking the heavens for
a divine effort.
