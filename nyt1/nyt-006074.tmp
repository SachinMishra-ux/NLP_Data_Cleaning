BASEBALL-HEART (Boston) It's a rare but fatal danger in the
world of sports: A young athlete receives a sharp but fairly mild
blow on the chest, then collapses and dies. Researchers using pigs
to investigate this phenomenon, commotio cordis, have found that
there is a 15-millisecond period in the normal cardiac cycle where
a baseball thrown at 30 miles an hour can cause dangerous
ventricular fibrillation. By Philip J. Hilts.
DOLLAR-YEN (Washington) The Fed and the Bank of Japan stage a
surprise attack on the strong dollar, intervening in the
foreign-exchange market to sell the American currency and buy yen.
At midday, the dollar stood at 138.12 yen, well below its level of
143.47 yen in late New York trading Tuesday. Stocks rose on the
news, and Treasury bonds fell sharply. By David E. Sanger.
PRUDENTIAL-RESTRUCTURE (Undated) After paying heavy fines and
settlement costs arising from widespread accusations that it
cheated its customers, Prudential Life Insurance is now steering
through the New Jersey legislature a corporate restructuring plan
that consumer advocates say contains troubling loopholes. By Joseph
B. Treaster.

Like it or not, you're all linked now. You are historical soul
brothers. You are representatives of the two greatest dynasties in
world basketball history, and from this moment on, it will be
impossible to discuss one without mentioning the other. What you
have accomplished is in the books, subject to perusal as long as
they play this sport on this planet.
The Boston Celtics once won 11 championships in 13 seasons. The
run began on Saturday, April 13, 1957, in Boston Garden with a
stirring 125-123 double-overtime victory over the St. Louis Hawks,
and it ended Monday, May 5, 1969, in the Fabulous Forum with an
upset 108-106 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. There was one
playing link between Title No. 1 and Title No. 11 Bill Russell.
The Chicago Bulls have won six championships in the last eight
seasons. Their run began Wednesday, June 12, 1991, in the Great
Western Forum with a 108-101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers and it
was expanded Sunday, June 14, 1998, in the Delta Center with an
87-86 win over the Utah Jazz. There have been two playing links Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
The Bulls have absolutely no idea what life was like in
Russell's time. The Bulls have never taken an overnight train. They
don't scrunch themselves into cabs. They don't change planes. They
don't stay two to a room in second-rate hotels with laughably small
meal money.
The Bulls, like most NBA clubs, are a team of millionaires. The
Celtics worried about lining up offseason jobs.
