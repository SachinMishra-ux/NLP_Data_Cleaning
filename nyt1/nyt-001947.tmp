Public water utility directors and state agriculture officials
were happier than environmentalists with the plan's assurances that
they would have enough water most of the time. But sugar growers
south of Lake Okeechobee vehemently object to a provision that
would use 94 square miles of their cane fields for some of the
proposed reservoirs.
Likewise, utility officials question the proposal's reliance on
vast underground storage wells, a technology that no one has ever
used on such a scale.
QuickReadCongress has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to come up with a plan to restore the Everglades by overhauling the
drainage system of South and Central Florida. A $7.5 billion
proposal would accomplish these steps during the next 20 to 50
years:
Store more water: Engineers would build 286 square miles of
reservoirs and filter marshes on all sides of Lake Okeechobee and
along the Everglades' eastern fringes. They could store as much as
467 billion gallons that otherwise would flow out to sea.
Try new technology: Hundreds of storage wells could trap 1.7
billion gallons a day underground during rainy years, then give it
back during droughts. The average yearly yield could be 130 billion
gallons.
Go with the flow: The corps would bulldoze some interior
Everglades canals and levees to return some of the natural,
broad-flowing sheets of water to its marshes.
What's next: The corps and the South Florida Water Management
District expect to unveil a revised proposal in mid-October, hold
public hearings in November and submit a final version to Congress
by July 1, 1999. Want to learn more? The corps' proposal, studies

Hopes for a reunion between Barbara Kurth and the daughters
taken from her in 1979 appeared dim Thursday as the kidnap saga
involving her ex-husband Stephen Fagan played out on national
television for the second night in a row.
One night after Fagan blasted her on ABC's Prime Time Live as a
drunkard who had endangered their daughters' lives, Kurth defended
herself on CNN's Larry King Live. The back-to-back interviews shed
little new light, but turned up the heat in a case that has drawn
national attention since Fagan's April 16 arrest at his Palm Beach
mansion on 18 1/2-year-old Massachusetts kidnap charges.
Fagan said he spirited the girls to Florida and changed their
identities to rescue them from Kurth. He points to affidavits from
three of her neighbors at the time who said she neglected the girls
and often appeared drunk. Fagan also cites two driving under the
influence convictions against Kurth from 1979 as evidence of a
drinking problem.
