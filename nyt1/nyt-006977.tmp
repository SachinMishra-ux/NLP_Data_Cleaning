Well, it's true that one New Yorker in 18 collects welfare. It's
also true that the overwhelming majority of those welfare
recipients are children people who can't yet work and would
starve in the streets if they weren't provided for them. But I can
understand resentment against able-bodied adults who are on the
dole.
Oh, you think that doesn't happen? Then you should know that
about two years ago, just before Congress passed welfare reform,
the inspector general of the Social Security Administration looked
into how many inmates nationwide were illegally receiving Social
Security benefits, mostly disability payments.
His estimate? About 60,000 jail and prison inmates were
continuing to collect that money even though they were in the
slammer and no longer eligible. How much money are we talking
about? Oh, only about $500 million a year.
How can a thing like this happen? Well, when the inmates go into
the slammer some of them somehow neglect to mention to anybody in
authority that they're collecting. OK, so that's fraud. So, what's
anybody going to do to them put them behind bars?
The Empire State has about 7 percent of the country's
population. That meant that, all factors being equal, about 4,200
New York jail and prison inmates probably were collecting illegal
Social Security benefits.
And, when you talk about New York as opposed to the rest of
America, nothing is ever equal. New York is Ripoff Central, USA.
New Yorkers probably had more than their share of incarcerated
Social Security cheats.
What Washington did to deal with this was to come up with a
bounty system to encourage state prison systems and local jails to
find Social Security cheats. Find a cheat and we'll give you money,
Washington said.
So now the New York state prison system is assiduous about
trying to catch Social Security cheats. The state averages about
five grand a month in bounty money from the feds. Local jails are
also trying to crack down. Last year, for example, the Saratoga
County jail in suburban Albany, which has maybe 190 inmates at any
given moment, found 11 Social Security cheats and collected $4,400
in bounty money from the feds. So far this year, Saratoga County
has nailed another four and collected about $2,800 in bounties. The
jail in Rensselaer County, another Albany suburb with about 265
inmates at any given moment, caught four guys just in the past
month.
But no such bounty program exists for state-delivered benefits
like welfare. And people who go to jail are more likely to be
receiving welfare benefits than the general population.
Three years ago, the administration of Gov. George Pataki began
comparing state and local inmate lists with welfare lists. Since
then, the computer runs have nailed about 2,500 inmates a year and
saved about 12 million bucks annually. But, given the Social
Security Administration figures, that number strikes me as a bit
low.
