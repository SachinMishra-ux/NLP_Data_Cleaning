Politics continue to swirl around this game the way hot-dog
wrappers swirl around ballparks. But politics don't seem to
resonate in the slightest with the 23-year-old Hejduk. He was only
5 in 1979 when the Americans were taken hostage at the U .S.
Embassy in Tehran. At the time, he said, he was into soccer,
surfing and recess.
He had much the same incredulous reaction in January 1997, when
he did not hear his watch alarm, and he missed a team flight to
China. Infuriated, coach Steve Sampson dismissed Hejduk from the
team and planned never to call him back.
Hejduk said that, at the time, he wasn't sure whether he
preferred soccer over surfing. A native of Cardiff, Calif., he had
been a state surfing champion in high school. And he had wanted a
surfboard, not room and board at some university, but his parents
convinced him that a soccer scholarship to UCLA was not an
opportunity to be wasted. Nor, he later realized, was a chance to
play in the 1998 World Cup.
Marriage and the birth of a son have brought maturity and
discipline to Hejduk, according to Sampson, who granted him a
second chance. And Hejduk says he now sets six alarm clocks instead
of one.
His biography was not included in the 1998 soccer team media
guide. But Hejduk intrigued Sampson with his tireless running in a
1-0 victory over Brazil in February and scored in a 3-0 exhibition
victory over Austria in April. Then he missed the final four World
Cup tuneups with a hamstring injury and was nearly cut from the
team.
Healthy again, he remains one of the few real American threats
with his ability to sprint ceaselessly down the wing. Except,
perhaps, for Cobi Jones, no one on the team can match Hejduk's
enduring speed. And few demonstrated the absolute fearlessness that
he showed against Germany.
The coach has theorized that Hejduk gets his fearlessness in
soccer from surfing. And Hejduk believes there is no other
cardiovascular workout so effective. What do his surfing friends
think of soccer? They love it, Hejduk said.
Perhaps that is why Payne Stewart was so giddy after a 4-under
66 in Thursday's opening round, which was contested under very mild
conditions, at least in these parts. Yep, no wind, no fog and thank goodness no you-know-what.
Defending champ Ernie Els also had his putting problems on
greens that, for the most part, were fairly moist and slow by
Olympic standards. His chances for a third national championship in
the past five years looked bleak after a 75.
If there was a player who had it on cruise control, it was
Carnevale. He never made a bogey while carding a 67.
