Everyone close to Bibby raves about the job his mother did in
raising him. He is unfailingly polite to strangers and never
declined an autograph request at Arizona, where Wildcats players
are the most recognized people in town.
Following Falk's advice, the Clippers are the only team Bibby
has visited in the weeks preceding the draft. Clippers officials
aren't saying much about their draft intentions and are rumored to
be interested in trading the pick. There is also speculation they
might draft Olowokandi, especially if they fear losing center Isaac
Austin through free agency.
In that case, Bibby could drop a few spots. He said it doesn't
matter to him. If it happens, then he'll have something to prove to
the Clippers, as well as to the guy at Foot Locker.
LYON, France In simpler times, a demonstration was what a
door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman offered to give the lady of
the house.
In Tehran, there would be dancing, singing, weeping. The
explosion of national pride might rival the scene that erupted in
November after Iran, playing in Melbourne, Australia, qualified for
the World Cup for the first time in 20 years. In a passionate
outpouring, 2 million citizens including 5,000 women who ignored
police instructions to stay home filled the streets. Women ripped
off their government-mandated veils. When the team returned home,
Iranians welcomed them, packing 120,000-seat Azadi stadium.
The U.S. team, of course, hopes to prevent a day (or days) of
rapturous glee.
Few Iranian players appear to regard the American team as an
emissary of the Great Satan. Their coach, Jalal Talebi, spent 17
years in the United States. A kind, soft-spoken man, Talebi
sometimes answers even Persian questions in fluent English. He
would make an excellent ambassador.
Most American players are too young to remember the hostage
crisis in Iran almost 20 years ago. To a man, they repeat the
it's-just-another-big-game quote, and downplay the political
overtones.
But this is isn't just the next game. The world's most popular
sporting event has given Iran a major place on an international
stage for the first time since the revolution led by Ayatollah
Khomenei overthrew the Shah in 1979.
Iranians have the opportunity to show themselves as sportsmen
and fans, not as terrorists and religious fanatics, which is how
they are perceived in the West.
