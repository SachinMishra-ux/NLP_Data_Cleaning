The beauty of this highly accessible book lies in Montaigne's
sense that to parse Russia, one must at some point escape the big
cities and venture into villages and wilderness. Montaigne is no
tea-drinking urban intellectual in need of the theater to
understand the fatalism and laughter-through-tears ethic that make
this country tick.
In a tone engaged but distanced, and in a language denuded of
adornment, Montaigne details the lives of hermits and truckers,
fishermen and madmen. This is not an idyllic version of pastoral.
Montaigne writes, accurately, of a country awash in hopelessness,
alcoholism, and a conviction that rules are for the weak. But he
also shows the real Russia to be generous, friendly, and, at times,
hard-working.
The writer's friend Chumak, an extraordinarily foulmouthed but
endearing farmer in southern Russia, typifies the medieval
conditions of this former agricultural powerhouse.
In the depths of far eastern Siberia, scrappy, entrepreneurial
long-haul truckers who make their living transporting Korean
cookies to villages in the middle of nowhere take Montaigne along
for the ride, generously sharing provisions. These truckers, for
whom a breakdown in 50-degrees-below-zero winters can be deadly,
listen to their rickety Kamaz engines as carefully as a Bolshoi
Theater-goer does a symphony.
Montaigne is not always the cultural anthropologist a journalist
should be, especially when he dismisses Soviet monuments and
slogans as nonsense or resorts to stale asides about the
Bolsheviks. And he is a novice of a fly-fisherman, maladroit in the
art of deceiving one's prey at least in Russia. But the blunt,
direct style that for most of his journey yields him few trout
serves him well as a narrator, and one need not be a fisherman or a
Russophile to gain pleasure from this book.
Several times, Montaigne describes himself as bitten by the
fishing bug, enraptured by the art of beguiling his quarry. But
what has really captured and enchanted Montaigne's soul is Russia.
His is an adventure of which well-heeled Western anglers kitted
out in costly accouterments and tangled up in expectations that the
world must be ordered and rational to make sense can only dream.
