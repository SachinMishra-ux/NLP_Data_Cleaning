In wars past, that meant a bloodied pilot flying a crippled
bomber back to base in war-torn Europe, miraculously saving the
lives of his crew. Or a lone infantryman in an Asian jungle
fighting off hostile forces to rescue injured comrades behind enemy
lines.
Bravery like that is hard to come by now, when the conflicts
that U.S. troops engage in are typically brief affairs in which
unmanned Tomahawk cruise missiles have replaced firefights and tank
battles.
When the Congressional Medal of Honor Society meets this weekend
in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., more than half of the 163 living
recipients are expected to attend. Since 1863, 3,399 people have
received the award, including one woman, Mary Walker, a Civil War
surgeon from Oswego, N.Y.
While Pentagon officials insist the stringent requirements in
the statutes have not changed, some retired brass fear politics has
colored the selection process recently. There was even some
surprise at the Pentagon when President Clinton and Congress
approved the awards for the sergeants killed in Somalia.
Was there a chance that rewarding the soldiers' unquestionable
gallantry was a way to salve the wounds of a nation badly shaken by
the tragedy? Absolutely not, say Pentagon officials.
Given the reverence for valor in the military culture, it is
hard for civilians to understand the prestige the medal bestows on
its recipient. There are concrete benefits: an extra $400-a-month
pension and a lifetime pass for military aircraft. But the
intangibles are equally significant.
As an unrelenting defender of the idea that we need to
understand history, I was pleased to learn of the current essay
contest in which writers are asked to explain why they'd like to
dine on a gourmet meal in the cemetery where President James A.
Garfield is buried. 
I apologize if I'm the one to break the news to you about
Garfield's demise. But it was in all the papers in the summer of
1881, when Charles J. Guiteau, known to history as a disappointed
office seeker, shot Garfield at a railroad station in Washington,
D.C., only a few months into Garfield's term. 
Garfield, of tough Ohio stock, did not immediately go flatline
and sprout wings, however. Rather, he signed an extradition paper
as his last official act and then slipped into long and awkward
unconsciousness. 
At any rate, Garfield no relation to the cat finally cashed
in his chips on Sept. 19, 1881, some 80 days after the disgruntled
Guiteau plugged him. I cannot find any record of whether this made
Guiteau a little more gruntled, but perhaps my research has not
been thorough enough.
