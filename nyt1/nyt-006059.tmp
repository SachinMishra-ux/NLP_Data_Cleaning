But you can also detect contradictions and banked fires in the
29-year-old actress. Given the right stimulus, a wild side could
emerge, something Scully might deem as alien as a sewer-dwelling
human tapeworm.
Now add to the list of Anderson's burgeoning responsibilities
that of movie star. But even that has more riding on it than your
average TV actor's initial forays into the costlier, higher-stakes
realm of feature films.
In the movie, Scully and Duchovny's Fox Mulder have been
reassigned to an anti-terrorist unit following the destruction of
the X-Files in last season's closing episode of the show. But that
doesn't stop them from getting involved in another alarming
operation rife with alien colonizers and their apparent allies, the
international Syndicate of rich, powerful, ruthless and mysterious
men.
Ranging from a bombed-out building in Dallas to a bizarre
experimental facility beneath the Antarctic snowpack to FBI hearing
rooms in Washington where, as usual, Mulder and Scully have a lot
of explaining to do, the movie indeed delivers its share of summer
entertainment excitement. But the scene that may excite X-Philes
most involves a close encounter between Scully and Mulder in his
apartment building's hallway.
She was also a complete punk at the time black clothes, Mohawk
hairdo, a piercing here and there and that decidedly
un-Scully-like presentation attitude traveled with her to L.A.
Though praised now for the exponential improvement in her fashion
taste over the last couple of years, initially Anderson was hardly
a casting director's dream.
At least Gillian Anderson has some. Which brings us back to the
subject of Scully and whether the poor gal ever has any fun.
It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon the time he usually takes his son
to the park he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing and,
many would say, inappropriate interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women and their older husbands to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
