The trial brought out details about Watson's past drug use and
emotional problems, and her attorneys played for jurors a film her
brother made about their family's coping with her substance abuse.
While Watson believed she carried the AIDS virus, she spoke to
students, jail inmates and others about AIDS and the
life-threatening dangers of risky behavior.
Several jurors interviewed after the trial said they did not
focus on Watson's past in determining whether any of the defendants
could be faulted for negligence.
Augustine diagnosed the AIDS virus for Watson in September 1991
based on a positive HIV test after she checked into Willow Creek
Hospital in Arlington for depression and substance abuse.
Watson's suit said that her blood sample was switched or
contaminated during the process, between being drawn at Willow
Creek and tested in Tennessee and California. But the trial did not
show conclusively what happened that led to her receiving a
positive test report.
During the trial, Watson's attorneys argued that Augustine
wrongly assessed her HIV status since she had no telltale symptoms.
They said Sotman and Barbaro provided substandard medical care
because they did not retest Watson or question the diagnosis even
though she never developed key signs of HIV.
Defense attorneys countered that the physicians acted reasonably
based on what they knew. The lawyers also argued that Watson would
have had the hysterectomy anyway because of problems with
endometriosis and ovarian cysts.
Juror Albert Kirkpatrick, 40, of the Fort Worth suburb of
Watauga, the only dissenter, said he drew a conclusion different
from the other jurors after looking at all the evidence.
Kirkpatrick, an American Airlines facility maintenance mechanic,
also said he was swayed by Watson's expert witness.
CHICAGO Ron Harper woke up on Sunday morning and felt
refreshed when he looked out his window. No Wasatch Mountains meant
no game at the Delta Center. No derisive chants or tasteless signs
from annoying Jazz fans.
It began for another team in Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals on Sunday night. Karl Malone and John Stockton
also were not in Utah anymore. If that was not made clear by the
nonchalant way Michael Jordan's team converted dunks and
3-pointers, it was evident in the surreal margin of victory on the
scoreboard.
