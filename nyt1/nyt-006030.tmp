The hard disk's sluggishness sometimes delays keyboard response.
To speed things up, I would seriously consider adding an extra 32
megabytes of random access memory for about $75. The current
maximum RAM total is 64 megabytes; newer forms of memory expected
later this year will extend that limit to 96.
A monaural speaker, a headphone jack, a microphone (and separate
input), an infrared port and a Universal Serial Bus port are all
built in. A port replicator is included and offers the other
standard connectors printer, serial, keyboard, mouse and monitor but dangles from the computer, connected only by a cable. The
unit also comes with an outboard floppy disk drive.
A matching CD-ROM player costs about $300. It uses a PC Card to
connect, but in a rare design gaffe, it requires AC power and
cannot use the same power adapter as the computer. One of the
portable PC Card CD-ROM drives that can run on batteries would be a
better choice. Clever stereo speakers that cost about $100 a pair
and weigh about an ounce each snap on and off the edges of the
screen like ears without requiring cables. They improve the sound,
but the volume is low and their output will not be confused with
high fidelity.
The computer's battery life is surprisingly good. In my tests,
the purple lithium-ion cylinder that comes with the unit lasts
about two hours at the maximum performance setting if you avoid
using the hard disk much and about an hour more if you let the
power management software reduce screen brightness and slow things
down. Frequent fliers will want the double-cylinder auxiliary
battery that adds about five ounces to the machine's total weight
but lasts significantly longer and helps balance the unit by
sticking out a bit at the back. Its only drawback is that it costs
about $300.
A button beside the power switch can be programmed to run any of
three programs of your choosing whenever you press it alone or in
combination with the Alt or Control keys. A flip-out door turns
into a K56flex modem that accepts a standard phone jack,
eliminating the need for special connectors. Software should allow
it to be upgraded to the newer V.90 standard at no charge.
What I hope will not become standard is Sony's practice of
making the warranty last just 90 days unless you register the
machine to get nine months more. Batteries are warranted for a
measly 30 days, period.
In the coming months, lightweight computers ranging from cheaper
Windows CE machines to pricier machines with bigger screens and
their own distinctive looks will vie for the spotlight. But for the
moment the VAIO 505G is one of the best deals around. And if you
want to attract attention with your computer, there may be no
better way than to flaunt Sony's skinny lavender dandy.
The government's antitrust battle against Microsoft Corp. has
not tarnished the company's reputation as an outstanding business
that makes high-quality products. But according to the latest New
York Times/CBS News poll, a majority of Americans do think that
Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should
continue to investigate the company and its business practices.
Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up
interviews, people again and again expressed deep admiration for
the accomplishments of Microsoft and Bill Gates, the company's
famous co-founder and chairman. Yet the same people repeatedly said
there was an important role for the government to play to make sure
that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that
Microsoft has come to symbolize.
In the court of public opinion, the burden of proof clearly
rests on the side of the government to show that Microsoft has done
anything illegal. Fifty-five percent of Americans surveyed said
that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft, while only 15
percent held an unfavorable opinion. (The remaining 30 percent had
no opinion on the matter.) Most people said their opinion of
Microsoft had not changed as a result of the Justice Department's
investigation.
