Media reaction around the country has been huge. Local and
regional newspapers gave the survey heavy play, as did did
television and radio news broadcasts. It also made network TV news.
Part of the heavy coverage was because the magazine listed the
Washington metropolitan area as the best big Eastern city in which
to live. And, of course, every city wanted to know its place on the
list.
The Washington selection was a surprise to many who were used to
a litany of bad news coming out of the nation's capital about
crime, drugs and schools. But for the city and its suburbs, clean
air, good health care, low property taxes and cultural institutions
helped tip the scale.
Citing its large middle class and skilled work force, Rogers
thinks India will generate profits for investors over the next 5 to
15 years. He acknowledges however, that this depends on peace in
the region.
POLITICS AND COMPUTERS July's Smart Money, in a Washington
column by Albert R. Hunt and Alan Murray, points to the political
dangers facing Vice President Albert Gore Jr. if the worst fears
about the so-called millennium bug, or the year 2000 problem, are
realized. If the problem spirals out of control, they argue, the
Clinton administration and especially the vice president who has
aligned himself with high-technology issues won't escape the
fallout. This is an issue on which the Republicans are already
sharpening their knives.
MONEY FROM WATER The July issue of Individual Investor explores
ways to profit from water, which is getting increasingly expensive
as its demand soars. For instance, the magazines points out that it
takes 40,000 gallons to produce enough steel for just one car. Some
companies it thinks could profit from this growing demand are
American Water Works, Ionics, Nalco Chemical, United Water
Resources and United States Filter.
DEAL TIME If you were prescient or lucky enough to have
dumped some stock when the Dow topped 9,200 in April and that cash
is burning a hole in your pocket, Money magazine's series of
articles on super deals what the editors call great products at
great prices may be just your thing.
For bargain-hungry shoppers, Money's pick of a high-end outlet
mall is Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y. If
you're in the market for a diaper bag for the baby, the
recommendation goes to a deluxe model from Lands' End for $49.50.
Looking for something a little more exotic? How about a MIG-15 UTI,
a jet trainer used by the Soviet air force in the 1950s and 1960s?
It can be yours, ready to fly, for $110,000 from Fantasy Flyers in
Sante Fe, N.M.
If you like to travel, Money points to a $2,500 around-the-world
ticket offered jointly by Air Canada, Lufthansa, SAS, Thai Airways,
United Airlines and Varig. The ticket is good for up to a year and
you can plan your trip as you go.
But some are refreshingly honest, like Donald Trump's and
Michael Dell's. The Donald cites 40 Wall Street, an office building
he bought for $1 million two and a half years ago that is estimated
to be worth $100 million today. Dell's best deal? The $1,000 he
invested to found the Dell Computer Corp. on May 2, 1984.
