Feiner once tried to establish a town matchmaking service for
lonely suburban singles, though the plan was later simplified to
town-sponsored singles events, like dances.
He addresses criticism by trying to include everyone in
government. First, Feiner established the call-in town meeting, in
which people can stay home, watch the meeting on cable television
and phone in a comment. Now he has a deputy-supervisor program, and
he makes political foes his deputies on special issues to bring
them into the decision-making process.
 By EDDIE SEFKO c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SALT LAKE CITY The way the Chicago Bulls continue to talk the big
talk, they surely must be the most dominant team ever to fall
behind 1-0 in the NBA Finals.
Even though they have lost their last four road games and,
apparently, the snap and mystique that have made them one of the
NBA's dynasties, the Bulls say their will to win is stronger than
ever.
But the facts do nothing to support their case that this is the
same Bulls team that confidently and routinely wins tight games and
resists those muscle-tightening situations because they are who
they are.
Even the Utah Jazz, who will go for a 2-0 lead tonight at the
Delta Center, notices the difference.
Russell ended up being one of those mismatches whenever he lined
up against Toni Kukoc. Russell had 15 points and eight rebounds in
Game 1; Kukoc had nine points and three rebounds.
That no doubt makes Phil Jackson happy. What would make the
Zen-spouting coach happier is if the Bulls would prove again
tonight in Game 2 they haven't slipped a notch or two when it comes
to being clutch performers.
After one game of the Finals, it's far too early to write off
the Bulls. But Jackson said Thursday that his team was showing its
age, mainly because the Bulls were tired at the end of Game 1.
He cited two plays Jordan's inability to elevate and
subsequent shot-clock violation with 1:19 left in overtime and
Steve Kerr's hack of John Stockton when a still-fresh-looking
Stockton drove for a layup. The three-point play put Utah ahead by
five points in overtime.
