With Martinez uncooperative, Egurbide decided to try the case
without her. Nonetheless, on April 9, in the middle of the trial,
Carstairs ordered a body attachment for Martinez when she failed to
show up in court. When she arrived the next day, the judge
threatened to jail her immediately but released her when she
promised to show up promptly the next morning.
The next morning, she was late. Carstairs ordered her into
custody until she testified later that afternoon. The trial ended
with a hung jury and Roman received a 60-day jail sentence for a
probation violation. He was released from custody last week.
Before the trial, Martinez was studying to become a probation
officer. She now works as a retail clerk. She said the experience
changed her mind about a career in criminal justice.
Erika Cheetham, an English medieval scholar who made a fortune
translating the predictions of the 16th-century physician and
astrologer Nostradamus, who gazed not only at the stars but also,
legend had it, into a brass bowl of water to see visions of the
future, died on May 3 in London. She was 58.
They were on mass-market paperback best-seller lists for years
in the United States, Britain and other countries, and, since the
first book appeared in 1973, they have never been out of print.
But being a closet Lutheran in a time of the Inquisitions held
to punish heretics, most of Nostradamus' prophesies were cryptic
and written in a mix of archaic French, Latin, Greek, Italian or
English. Translators contended that the quatrains contained codes,
anagrams, hints and fragments of meaning that, put together, were
predictions of coming events. A reference to a figure named Hister
was taken as code for Hitler.
Erika McMahon-Turner was born in London on July 7, 1939, a
daughter of wealthy parents, Eric Turner, under secretary to the
Admiralty, and Helen Lilian McMahon Turner. She attended a convent
school but was expelled for writing an essay contending that God
did not exist. She had an interest even then in the paranormal and
the prophetic. Later, on gaining acceptance to St. Anne's College,
Oxford, she cut a stylish, aristocratic figure, someone who went
riding with the Aga Khan and married a Grenadier Guard, James
Nicholas Milne Cheetham.
After receiving her Ph.D. she became a staff writer for The
London Daily Mail. She wrote an article on Nostradamus in 1961 and
two years later began translating his work in earnest.
Indeed, at the start of the 1990s at least 10 Nostradamus titles
were in print, and with the advent of the Persian Gulf war,
bookstores in Britain and the United States were selling out, with
total sales tripling in some cases.
