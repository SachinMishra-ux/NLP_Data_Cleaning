I've been assured he will be a delight come September, when the
Ruth/Maris numbers are squarely in his cross hairs and he feels a
more pressing need to reflect on his place in the cosmos. Still,
you wonder why he can't relax, smile a bit and at least let himself
appear to be having fun.
McGwire is an equal-opportunity mauler. He unapologetically
roughs up everybody. Ray Lankford, leading off the fifth, had just
knocked a Reynolds pitch into the cheap seats. No matter. When
McGwire came up, he didn't give squat about Shane's hurt feelings.
He just parked another into some even cheaper seats with a flick of
his thick wrists. It was his second in two nights after a rare
three-game hiatus.
The monster mash gave the Cardinals just enough of a margin to
win the series. So, in the 7-6 squeaker, McGwire's shot would be
the difference. He had to speak afterward. He makes his own rules.
If he figures in the outcome, and only if, then he will suffer
fools, albeit not gladly.
Reynolds, for his part, was rendered speechless after what could
only be described as a shaky outing. Hey, how would you feel if
somebody had gone that deep off you?
These days, they're almost all McGwire's days, whether he likes
them or not.
 By JAYNE CUSTRED c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SAN FRANCISCO When Tom Lehman walked off the 10th green Thursday
at The Olympic Club, it looked like his three-year run of
contending at the U.S. Open was in danger of coming to an end.
Lehman had just three-putted from four feet for a double-bogey
6, putting himself at 2-over for the day. But Lehman said that more
than anything, the hole strengthened his resolve to play better on
the remaining eight holes.
Lehman ended up making birdies on three of the final four holes
and finished only two strokes off the lead at 2-under-par 68. That,
of course, sets him up nicely for another run at yet another Open
title. In the last three years, Lehman has finished third, tied for
second, and third at the U.S. Open. But Lehman insisted Thursday
that this is a tougher course for him than the last three.
Lehman showed on the back side of the first round just how good
his best can be. He sank a 15-footer for birdie on No. 11 and then
drained a long 30-foot birdie putt on No. 15. Lehman added a
12-footer on No. 16 and closed with a six-foot birdie on No. 18.
But Lehman said that perhaps his best effort was his par save on
No. 12, where he hit way right off the tee, had to pitch back out
into the fairway and then hit a sand wedge to within 10 feet and
made the putt.
