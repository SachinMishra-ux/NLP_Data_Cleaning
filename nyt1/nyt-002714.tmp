Although the as-yet-unnamed site will be built around financial
information, it will expand to include online brokerage, travel and
banking services as well as chat rooms and message boards, he said.
Whether it's credit cards, insurance products or mutual funds,
financial companies like Banco Popular are starting to take aim at
the nation's growing ethnic markets.
On one hand, ethnic consumers are getting more opportunities
than ever to join the financial mainstream. On the other hand,
objective noncommercial information about products and services is
still hard to find in many of these communities.
The preapproved offer from Banco Popular, for example, included
a $750 credit line, a $30 annual fee, and a 21.9 percent interest
rate.
Informed consumers would know that if they had shopped around,
they could have qualified for a no-fee credit card with a lower
interest rate.
There's a big untapped market for financial goods and services
in ethnic markets, according to Claritas Inc., an Arlington,
Va.-based market research firm.
Of the almost 267 million people in the United States, 12.7
percent are African American, 10.7 percent are Hispanic and 5.6
percent are Asian American (Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese,
and Asian and Pacific Islander), Claritas said.
Just 5.41 percent of Hispanics, 5.01 percent of African
Americans and 14.38 percent of Asian Americans owned mutual funds
in 1997, Claritas said.
And 47.22 percent of Hispanics, 61.42 percent of African
Americans and 52.70 percent of Asian Americans had life insurance
in 1996, the most recent figures available, Claritas said.
Banco Popular certainly isn't alone in targeting ethnic
consumers. Freedom Card Inc., based in Marina Del Rey (Los Angeles
County), plans a statewide rollout next month of the Freedom Card,
a credit card targeting African Americans who haven't established
credit histories.
