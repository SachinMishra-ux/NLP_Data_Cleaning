In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. (To publish this provocative 1,125-word article, it must be

Paul has succeeded Mike Groff as driver of Jonathan Byrd's No.
10 Dallara//Aurora, beginning with tomorrow night's True Value
500k. For a driver who exited the Indianapolis 500 with his Pep
Boys Indy Racing League future in limbo, the past three days have
been like winning the lottery. In three states.
Paul finished seventh in the 82nd Indy 500 on May 24, driving
for Team Pelfrey, a ride he picked up after Danny Ongais was
injured in a practice crash. Paul drove the first two races of 1998 and the previous two IRL seasons with PDM Racing. He finished
10th at Orlando, Fla., and 19th at Phoenix this year before his
stirring performance at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he
led 39 laps. Only race-winner Eddie Cheever Jr. led more laps with
76.
Byrd's team, which is sponsored by VisionAire-Bryant Heating Cooling, is one of the IRL's originals. But it has been
overshadowed by the recent successes enjoyed by Team Menard,
Treadway Racing and A.J. Foyt Racing.
Byrd said Paul's performance at Indy was not the sole reason he
got the job. At age 22, Paul became the youngest champion in the
history of the International Motor Sports Association GT series in
1982 the year he also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and Sebring 12
Hours endurance races. Paul also won the Championship Auto Racing
Teams' Michigan 500 in 1983.
Odd-even gas ration lines formed at service stations across the
nation, and skyrocketing mortgage rates made young families despair
of ever owning a home.
But Americans, on average, saved more than twice as much of
their income for the future (ital)then(end ital) as they do now.
Barring a change, that means potential difficulties for the
estimated 77 million baby boomers who will reach retirement age
over the next two decades, he said.
Lyons and more than 200 other business and government leaders
are meeting in Washington Thursday and Friday (June 4 and 5) to
help sound that wake-up call.
The occasion is the Retirement Education Savings Summit, ordered
last year by Congress and the White House as part of a national
effort to spur Americans to begin saving more for retirement.
