Hincapie is 6 feet 3 inches and 185 pounds. He is a fifth-year
pro who got his first bike at age 8 and promptly won a BMX race. He
was born in Richmond Hill, N.Y., and at age 11 moved to
Farmingdale, N.Y. He now lives in Charlotte, N.C.
He rides for the U.S. Postal Service team, where his teammates
include Lance Armstrong and Frankie Andreu, who were on his first
pro team, Motorola. When Armstrong was healthy, Hincapie and Andreu
comprised his support group. Now, 20 months after Armstrong
underwent extensive surgery for testicular cancer that had spread
to his abdomen and brain, he has been riding for them.
Armstrong kept the race honest. After five others had broken
away early and stayed in front for 90 miles and almost four hours,
he led the chase that reeled them in. With 16 miles to go, he led
the race. With seven miles to go, he led the race.
After that, he pushed the pace, ran down breaks and helped lead
Hincapie through the pack to a position where Hincapie could win.
Armstrong finished 33rd, 19 seconds behind Hincapie. But as an
ultimate team player in this ultimate team sport, Armstrong was a
winner. After the race, he was satisfied.
Petra Rossner, a 31-year-old German who rides for the
Vizir-Russian National team, won the $44,737 Liberty Classic for
women, the world's richest one-day race for women. She beat Diana
Ziluite of Lithuania by three bike lengths, or 18 feet. The first
51 finishers were timed in 2 hours 22 minutes 18 seconds for 57.6
miles, an average of 24.29 miles an hour. The race, run during the
men's race, drew 115 starters and 96 finishers. ... Jeannie Longo
of France and Zulfia Zabirova of Russia, the 1996 Olympic
champions, were involved in a four-rider crash 300 meters from the
finish. Both suffered scrapes and bruises, and Zabirova was
hospitalized as a precaution.
WASHINGTON Rep. Albert Wynn of Maryland would seem an unlikely
figure to buck his party on the overhaul of campaign finance laws.
After all, he is seeking a position in the House Democratic
leadership next year.
But like some others in the Congressional Black Caucus, Wynn has
doubts about banning the unlimited, unregulated contributions to
political parties, known as soft money, at the heart of abuses in
the 1996 campaign. His doubts are partly because some of those
contributions have traditionally paid for get-out-the-vote drives.
As the House returns to its campaign finance debate, perhaps
later this week, the unlikely bipartisan coalition that has kept
the overhaul debate alive cannot afford to lose many of the three
dozen or so Democrats who, like Wynn, are undecided. Only 30 to 45
Republicans are thought to support the moves to reduce money in
politics. And that means that every Democratic vote is crucial if
an overhaul measure is to pass.
Moreover, holding onto the Democrats is just one of the
challenges facing the coalition as it maneuvers through what could
turn into a summer of legislative traps and pitfalls.
The 1996 presidential election saw the virtual collapse of the
post-Watergate campaign finance system, as the two political
parties found ways to use unregulated contributions to get around
campaign spending limits. But Republican leaders in Congress oppose
the effort to tighten the law, seeing it as an effort to erode
their party's traditional fund-raising advantage.
