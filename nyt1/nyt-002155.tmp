Several moderate Republican who voted against the resolution
said they were concerned about the lack of specifics in the measure
and warned that the tax cuts might be too much at a time when the
country is still saddled with an estimated $6 trillion debt.
In an attempt to head off an embarrassing defeat of the
resolution, Republican leaders twisted arms right up until the last
minute in hopes of keeping together enough of their GOP colleagues
to pass it. They were aided in their efforts by the defection of a
handful of conservative Democrats.
But despite the outcome in favor of more tax cuts, the House GOP
plan has almost no chance of standing up in conference with the
Senate, which has approved a more modest five-year budget blueprint
calling for $30 billion in tax cuts and few spending reductions
beyond those outlined in last year's balanced budget agreement with
President Clinton.
Indeed, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
has criticized the House resolution for not identifying where
spending reductions would be made to pay for the tax cuts, which
would come largely from the elimination of the so-called marriage
penalty.
Ending the marriage penalty, or the extra tax that an estimated
21 million couples would not have to pay if they were still filing
as singles, would benefit mostly upper, two-income families. That's
why some Republican moderates are worried that cuts in social
programs that affect the poor and retired could backfire on them in
an election year.
Elimination of the marriage penalty has long been a goal of
pro-family conservatives, and Gingrich promised in a meeting
several weeks ago with social and religious conservative leaders
that it would be included in the GOP budget plan.
Although the budget resolution is non-binding, it is used to set
the broad goals for spending and revenues as Congress goes about
its annual ritual of authorizing and appropriating funds for
government departments and agencies.
For example, the GOP House blueprint, authored by Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, calls for spending $1.73
trillion on federal programs in 1999. It envisions a budget surplus
of $34 billion next year and $223 billion by 2004. Kasich's plan
also delays most of its tax and spending cuts until 2003.
In their effort to defeat the measure, Democratic opponents drew
attention to the differences between the Kasich plan and the budget
resolution recently passed by the Senate. Differences over the two
measures, they warned, could lead to another government shutdown
this fall.
In rallying to pass the Kasich plan, the Republicans rejected a
budget proposal sponsored by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., that was
similar in many ways to the plan passed by the Senate. It also
contained $30 billion in tax cuts over five years with few spending
reductions. But it would have increased spending on education,
welfare, Medicaid and other programs by $10 billion. The increases
in those areas, however, would have been paid for by the same
amount of cuts in other entitlement programs. XXXX END OF STORY
