The 12.7-pounder earned Whitaker the biggest prize of the
tournament, but it wasn't the only fish caught by Whitaker that
claimed a prize.
On Friday, Whitaker caught a 7.71-pounder to win a $2,000 hourly
big-bass prize. The 12.7-pounder won an hourly prize Saturday
valued at more than $6,000 and then held up to claim the overall
championship during Sunday's final round, in which a 9.99-pounder
was the heaviest bass weighed.
Pulsipher's current mood stems from the holding pattern he is in
at Class AAA Norfolk. The 24-year-old left-hander is 7-5 with a
3.96 earned run average for the Tides, but he has lost his last two
starts. He knows there is no room for him in the Mets' rotation
right now. But that does not alleviate any of the thoughts going
through his head.
Not that Pulsipher has no chance for a call-up. The day after
trading for Hideo Nomo on June 4, Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips called Pulsipher to tell him that he would not rule out
promoting Pulsipher in a bullpen role. But that apparently did not
assuage Pulsipher's fears, because he and Phillips met in Norfolk
last week to talk again.
In 14 starts, Pulsipher has allowed 50 runs, 38 earned, and 91
hits in 86 1/3 innings. He has walked 41 and struck out 58. Lately,
his name has come up in trade rumors, but until a deal is made or
until the Mets beckon (and Mark Mimbs is the hottest left-hander in
Norfolk right now), Pulsipher will just have to wait.
The Mets have no such problems with Payton, who returned last
Monday from an 18-day stay on the disabled list because of a pulled
right hamstring. Duquette said Payton is not playing first base
anymore. It is either left field, center field or designated
hitter.
First, though, Payton needs to strengthen his hamstrings. While
he was on the disabled list, an examination showed that his
hamstrings were significantly weaker than his quadriceps. And even
though Payton was put on a strengthening program immediately, he
felt something in the right hamstring earlier this week.
That is because, at 25, Payton is the brightest offensive
prospect in the organization. After undergoing numerous elbow
surgeries that limited him to 71 minor-league games two seasons ago
and none last year, Payton is batting .255 with four home runs and
14 runs batted in, in 46 games with the Tides. He has 10 doubles,
three triples and 11 stolen bases. He has already been called up to
the Mets briefly this season, although he never actually appeared
in a game.
And it is not a stretch to think Payton could be playing a
little center field for the Mets, maybe even by the end of this
season.
With Wilson, it is difficult to know what the expectations are
anymore. Since undergoing surgery on his right shoulder on Nov. 12,
1996, the big right-hander has pitched in just five games, all last
season, and all in the low-level minor leagues.
