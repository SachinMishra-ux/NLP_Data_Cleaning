He won the attorney general's John Marshall Award as the top
federal prosecutor of 1994 for convicting Albert Bustamante, a
former representative from Texas, of racketeering and bribery, a
victory that has inspired a certain sharp-edged respect among
professional politicians.
His Texas foray, made as senior trial lawyer in the Justice
Department's public-integrity section, was just the fiery foundry
that Bennett needed for his job as Starr's deputy.
Bennett can be no less disarming socially. He and his wife,
Cindy, have four sons, ages 1 to 8, and their family became a
centerpiece of sorts in the temporary encampment of the Whitewater
teams in Little Rock. Friends prized a relaxed barbecue with the
Bennetts after a long day of tracking Bill Clinton.
Without fanfare but with potentially far-reaching significance
for the semiconductor industry, IBM has begun the industry's first
large-scale production of a type of chip that may reduce prices and
improve performance and portability for cellular phones and other
wireless communications devices.
The chips are based on technology developed by IBM Corp. in the
early 1980s for mainframe computers and redirected toward consumer
products. It combines the standard silicon used throughout the chip
industry with germanium, a metallic element that is so efficient a
conductor of electricity that it may reduce the power consumption
of portable devices as much as 50 percent.
The use of germanium, which is relatively easy for chip makers
to work with and is well suited to the electronics of
high-frequency radio communications, enabled IBM engineers to
combine wireless communications components and silicon digital
transistors on a single chip.
By consolidating equipment and capabilities that typically
require several chips or components, makers of cellular telephones
and other consumer products can reduce the size and complexity of
those products. Industry experts say it may eventually be possible
to create the entire electronics of a cellular phone on a single
chip.
Other applications may include home receivers for
direct-broadcast satellite television and various kinds of portable
devices for wireless connections to the Internet. Many analysts
also expect silicon germanium chips, because of their high-speed
processing ability, to play a key role in future network-switching
equipment for routing all sorts of Internet traffic.
The components market into which IBM will be selling the chips
is now estimated at $540 million a year, but the company predicted
that its own piece of the market would exceed $1 billion annually
within five years.
Initial customers for the IBM chips, which the company began
producing in large quantities last week at an updated plant in
Burlington, Vt., are Hughes Electronics, Harris Semiconductor,
National Semiconductor, Northern Telecom and Tektronix. All five
companies have also licensed IBM's technology to incorporate into
their own product designs. IBM said it had two dozen additional
customers, which it was not yet ready to identify.
