WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. If he watches the College World Series,
he must do so with greater interest than most, knowing that he once
owned it.
It was a feeling he seemed to have all season in 1995.
Kotsay hit .422 with 18 home runs and 75 RBI for Fullerton in
the regular season, and he went 2-1 with an 0.38 ERA and nine saves
out of the bullpen. Nice.
But once he got to Omaha, things really started to cook. Kotsay
had gone 6-for-13 with a homer and eight RBI in the 1994 Series, so
it's not like he was sneaking up on anybody. But the way he took
the Titans to the 1995 title will live forever in the memories of
those who were there.
 In the first round, he doubled and scored the tying run, put
down a sacrifice bunt to set up the winning run, and came out of
the pen to record the game's final five outs and earn the save in
Fullerton's 6-5 victory against Stanford.
 Tennessee was back for more in the semifinals, and this time
Fullerton beat them 11-0 as Kotsay chipped in with an RBI double.
 Then, in the final against USC, all Kotsay did was hit a
three-run homer and a two-run homer and get the final five outs in
relief.
He went 9-for-16 with three homers, 10 RBI, seven runs scored
and two saves in the Series, and left Omaha holding College World
Series record for career batting average (.517), slugging
percentage (1.103) and grand slams (two). He also tied the records
for home runs (four), championship-game homers (two) and
championship-game RBI (five).
Kotsay, of course, was the Marlins' first-round pick a year
later, and made it to the majors by the summer of 1997. Now that
he's a starter (and hitting .296 in his rookie season), there are
undoubtedly many more glory days ahead. But when it's College World
Series time, one can't help but remember the glory days of the
past.

June 6, 1998, are moving today to clients of the New York Times
News Service.
