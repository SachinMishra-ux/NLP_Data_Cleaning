The Diamondbacks' biggest opportunity came in the seventh, when
Bell led off with a single and Stinnett and pinch-hitter Yamil
Benitez walked to load the bases against right-handed reliever John
Frascatore.
Showalter went to right-hander Felix Rodriguez in the seventh,
but he gave up a leadoff single to Jordan and a two-run homer to
Lankford for a 4-1 lead.
Stinnett, who homered in the Diamondbacks' previous visit here
in mid-April, hit a one-out solo shot, his sixth of the season, off
right-hander Rick Croushore in the ninth. But it was too late.
Croushore struck out pinch-hitter Mike Robertson and got Batista
on a comebacker to end the game.
Showalter said Telemaco was to have been limited to between 60
and 70 pitches, but was allowed to go to 74. Showalter was mildly
pleased, and said Telemaco had earned another start, which will
come in an interleague game against Texas on Thursday at Bank One
Ballpark.
