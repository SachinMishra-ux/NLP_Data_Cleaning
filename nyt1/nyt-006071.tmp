Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
The two women corresponded for about a year. Sexton gossiped
about the other patients in the seminar, and enjoyed sharing
confidences with her young acolyte. When Plunkett announced that
she had left her psychiatrist because he had divorced his wife and
refused to embark on an affair with her, Sexton no stranger to
the temptations of the therapist's couch reacted knowingly:
Sexton offered heartfelt congratulations when Plunkett published
poems in the Hudson Review and the American Scholar during the
seminar. And she didn't hesitate to criticize Plunkett's work more
firmly than that of the other patients'. Upon receiving one batch
of Plunkett's poems, Sexton wrote her:
That was the summer of the moon landing, and Plunkett sent
Sexton a poem about the event. In her last letter to her former
student, Sexton wrote:
In the fall of 1968, the poet Anne Sexton received an unexpected
invitation. An administrator at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
inquired if she might want to teach a weekly seminar for patients
there.
Sexton accepted the invitation. The McLean seminar lasted from
the fall of 1968 until the spring of 1969. Between 15 and 25
patients attended, irregularly, depending on their mental states.
Several hundred of the poems the patients wrote for the seminar are
stored in the Anne Sexton archive at the Ransom Center for the
Humanities at the University of Texas, where Sexton's daughter and
literary executor, Linda Gray Sexton, granted me permission to read
them. And, for the first time, several patients or relatives of
deceased patients have agreed to discuss the seminar and its impact
on their lives.
The call came in September of 1968, in a note from Margaret
Ball, the patients' librarian at McLean:
That the call came from McLean weighed heavily on Sexton's mind.
Sexton had always wanted to be a patient at McLean, but in her own
view, had never made the grade. McLean, a Harvard teaching
hospital, attracted well-to-do patients from all over the country.
 Bentley College volleyball standout Heidi Anderson had no
interest in waking up mornings and finding patches of her long
blond hair a victim of the chemotherapy that was so necessary and
so devastating clumped on the pillow.
