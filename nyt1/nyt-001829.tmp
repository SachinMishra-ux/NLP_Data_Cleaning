The Jazz was vastly superior to the Bulls in the overtime.
Whether or not it was the fatigue taking its toll on Chicago, which
was playing its sixth game in 12 days and facing the Jazz, which
was coming off 10 days of rest, the Bulls did not look like
themselves.
What might help the Bulls is diversity. Jordan and Pippen
combined for 48 of the Bulls' 82 shots and for 54 of their 85
points.
Shandon Anderson, a member of Utah's productive bench, which
outscored Chicago's reserves 22-8, said he believes such numbers
don't work in the Bulls' favor. Anderson said he believes the Bulls
might be too reliant on Jordan. When the Bulls give the basketball
to Jordan, it's almost as if they rest and watch.
Then, at the end, Jordan and Pippen were fatigued and had
trouble making plays. They were a combined 1-for-4 from the field
in overtime.
The all-media wake for Frank Sinatra and the countdown that
preceded it took me back to April 1984, when I first dipped my toe
into the ghoul pool.
You've heard about the office football pool, and the baseball
Rotisserie league. But incredibly tasteless as it seems, countless
workplaces are also offering the dead pool, a funereal game of
wagering on when celebrities will meet their demise.
Neatly pairing two of America's prime obsessions fame and
death the game is another variation on your typical water-cooler
sport. Only instead of betting on scores, players toss pennies
against death's door.
To beat the odds, poolers scour the tabloids and gossip columns
for hints about their candidates' continued viability. The aged or
the terminally ill don't score the ghoulish competitor many points,
but who could have foreseen the recent untimely exits of Sonny
Bono, Chris Farley or John Denver?
As appalling as betting on the prospect of death may be,
wagering in the twilight zone is apparently appealing to a growing
number of Americans if the rise in the number of Web sites
dedicated to the subject is any gauge.
Dead-pool playbooks vary, but the most common version requires
contestants to compile a mortfolio of 10 celebrities they expect to
die and then submit it with an entrance fee by the beginning of
each year. Come Dec. 31, the most prescient player wins. Deaths and celebrity are typically confirmed by an Associated Press
obituary. Without that, you're nothing.
