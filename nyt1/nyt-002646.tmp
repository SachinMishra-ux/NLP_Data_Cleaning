Walden said he's looking at the $1 million Haskell Invitational
for 3-year-olds at Monmouth Park (N.J.) on Aug. 9, and Victory
Gallop could go on to the $750,000 Travers for 3-year-olds at
Saratoga in upstate New York on Aug. 29.
Baffert, who isn't much for long-range planning, said Real Quiet
could go to the Travers or face older horses for the first time in
the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 15. Three-year-old Best Pal
won the $1-million race in 1991.
The trainer said Real Quiet could even go in the $500,000 Swaps
Stakes at Hollywood Park on July 19.
More likely, Real Quiet will go to the Travers and Baffert will
run 4-year-old Silver Charm in the Pacific Classic. Silver Charm is
at Churchill Downs training for the $750,000 Stephen Foster
Handicap on Sunday.
The long-awaited meeting of Silver Charm and Skip Away could
come in the Pacific Classic. First, Skip Away is aiming for the $1
million Hollywood Gold Cup against Gentlemen on June 28.
Meanwhile, Baffert said he hasn't chosen a next race for Indian
Charlie, the Santa Anita Derby winner who ran third in the Kentucky
Derby.
Real Quiet flew out of New York Sunday morning and will be at
Churchill, Baffert said, probably until the season ends there June
28. Then he will go home to California.
The Triple Crown vanished Saturday just the way history said it
might. Real Quiet didn't lose by a nose, he lost by a quarter-mile.
ALBANY, N.Y. The high cost of auto insurance, an issue that
nearly cost Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey her job last year,
appears on the verge of becoming a major theme in New York's
gubernatorial campaign, with Democrats blaming Gov. George Pataki
for high rates.
Now that New Jersey has mandated a 15 percent cut in rates, New
York is about to overtake its neighbor as the state with the
nation's highest auto insurance premiums, having risen from sixth
place since 1993. Some Democratic strategists say that New York's
dubious new ranking could help give the issue the same political
potency here that it proved to have last year in New Jersey.
