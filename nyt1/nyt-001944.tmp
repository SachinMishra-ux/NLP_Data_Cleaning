MEDAL-OF-HONOR (Albany, N.Y.) Behind nearly every Medal of
Honor is a gripping story of the valor that earned this nation's
highest award. But in its own right, the Medal of Honor itself has
a storied past in its rise to what is now considered the world's
most prestigious decoration. By BRENDAN LYONS.
TRANSSEXUAL-COP (San Francisco) A transsexual trying to join
San Francisco's police force has filed a $3 million discrimination
claim with the city after her appeal of a failed psychological test
was turned down. By RAY DELGADO.
AIRPORT-EXPANSION (San Francisco) Kicking off what is likely
to become an environmental war over the sanctity of mud, the San
Francisco International Airport has announced it will seek to
expand its runways a job that could entail filling a major
portion of the Bay for the first time in 35 years. By ERIN
McCORMICK.
COMPUTER-COLUMN (Atlanta) Each year at the Electronic
Entertainment Expo, better known as E3, there is some easily
defined trend, something that a journalist looking for a snappy
lead paragraph or pithy sound bite could latch onto. This time,
though, E3 was about evolution instead of revolution. And it's the
computer and video game industry that's evolving by growing up. By
DWIGHT SILVERMAN
EMPLOYMENT-QUESTIONS (San Francisco) A security firm that
asked job applicants a series of questions probing their political
beliefs settled a class-action lawsuit for up to $2.1 million,
potentially changing the way employers around the nation screen job
candidates. By RAY DELGADO.
BBA-FEUD (San Francisco) American League president Gene Budig
will take a break from his usual regimen of signing baseballs and
getting into ballparks for free to hand out enormous suspensions,
fines and other spankings to both the Kansas City Royals and
Anaheim Angels for their beanball war. By RAY RATTO.
You should know the identity of anybody who would do something
so unspeakably vile. I can't even describe to you in detail either
the images he created or the words he used.
But he's only 17, and his grandfather called me in tears,
begging me not to name him. And, given the fact that no crime has
been committed and that none of the kid's victims has been left
dead or bleeding, I hadn't planned on naming the kid anyway.
So, let's just call him Beavis although, once you hear this,
you'll realize what a slur that is on that repugnant cartoon
character. Compared to this kid, Beavis and Butt-head come off like
Wally and the Beav.
I will name the school district, however. That's North Colonie,
an upscale suburban district just outside New York's state capital.
One district official I spoke to seemed horrified that anybody in
the public you know, like the taxpayers who pay the bills might
learn that something like this can happen in a classy school like
Shaker High.
