I'd start with the dominant and boring end -- putting half of
the contributions into Fidelity Spartan Market Index fund, which
simply seeks to track the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. (If you
don't like the idea of an index fund, you might consider another
solid large-cap dominated fund such as Fidelity Growth and Income,
but I would go with the index.) Then I would add 20 percent in a
good small-cap fund, such as Fidelity Low-Priced Stock.
I would split the final 30 percent equally among an
international fund such as Fidelity Overseas, and two sector funds
-- Fidelity Select Health Care and Fidelity Select Technology. Both
of these latter funds are likely to provide bumpy rides at times,
but with your very long outlook, you can afford to ride them out.
Finally, ignore the markets. What you are doing is effectively
embarking on a twenty- or thirty-yeasr dollar-cost averaging
program, and what you want to do it stuff away the $833 or $1,250 a
month regardless of the state of the markets -- reasoning that
whatever price you pay now will look mighty attractive a decade or
two hence.
Simply refuse to allow yourself to get spooked if a market turns
sour and you find yourself moving backwards for a quarter, or even
a year or so. Also, be realistic in your projection of
contributions. You'd be far better off settling for the lower
figure and sticking to it doggedly than by aiming high, making the
payment this month, missing it next month, and reducing it the
third.
Q. Can you tell me the best way to go with a $1,000 gift I plan
to make to a granddaughter on her graduation?
A. If this is a high-school graduation and she plans to go on to
college, I simply suggest a check made out to the college, with
your granddaughter's name on the memo line of the check. But if
this is a college graduation, I have two suggestions.
Unless you have a particular use in mind for the money, why not
simply give it to her and let her determine what to do with it.
Typically a new college graduate has never been so broke in her
life.
But let's suppose you want this money to stay with your
granddaughter and become the seed from which her future financial
security grows. In that case I suggest this: Tell her that after
she has reached $1,000 in earned income, you will give her a check
made out to a mutual fund company which will represent the
beginning of her retirement savings. I would suggest a Roth IRA
invested in either Vanguard Index 500 fund or Fidelity Spartan
Market Index fund -- almost identical offerings which simply seek
to track the course of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index. A modest
gift? Well, let's suppose she is 21 years old and leaves the money
there until she's 65. If the fund produces average annual returns
of 10 percent over those 44 years, the nestegg would be $66,264
when she is 65.
WASHINGTON In a significant tactical shift, President Clinton
will press his demands for the release of over a dozen Chinese
dissidents at next week's summit in China in closed meetings, not
in the media.
After years of wrangling publically with China over human
rights, the administration has decided to take a different approach
for the nine-day summit, which starts June 26. This stance is based
in part on the fact that China no longer holds dissidents who are
well-known outside of the country.
