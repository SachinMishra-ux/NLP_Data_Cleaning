ATLANTA At the request of Alabama's governor and congressional
delegation, a White House committee has backed off from
recommending President Clinton designate the Chattahoochee as an
American Heritage River.
The move by Alabama angered Georgia officials, and might
escalate an already bitter water war between the states. Georgia
officials, including Gov. Zell Miller, pushed for the designation,
which would pave the way for federal funds and programs to help
clean up, protect and maintain the environmental integrity of the
Chattahoochee.
Clinton is expected to name 10 waterways this month as American
Heritage Rivers under a program he created last year to bring
national attention to the importance of the nation's rivers. The 10

Quality, Alabama Gov. Fob James and members of the state's
congressional delegation claimed that giving the Chattahoochee that
designation could upset negotiations among Alabama, Florida and
Georgia to settle an interstate water war.
