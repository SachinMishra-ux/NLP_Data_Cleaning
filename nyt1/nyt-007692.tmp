Banks still make more money on interest income the spread
between what they charge on loans and what they pay on deposits than on customer fees.
 But the interest-rate spread is narrowing, as banks face
growing competition from brokerage firms and mutual funds for
customer assets.
To make up for smaller spreads, banks are raising old fees and
coming up with new ones. As a result, fee income is rising four
times faster than interest income and now accounts for nearly 40
percent of bank income compared to about 32 percent a decade ago.
 On balance, banks are still raking it in. In the first quarter

Marin building contractor William Kopiecki said he reads monthly
statements carefully and raises a ruckus if there's a problem. He
recently noticed that it took eight to 11 days for two checks he
wrote totaling $15,500 to be credited to his account at MBNA after
they were debited from his account at Citibank. After spotting the
long lag and complaining to Citibank, he was assured he would get
much of his lost interest returned.
For instance, if you rarely visit a teller, opt for an account
that offers unlimited checking, low minimum balance requirements
and low or no monthly fees as long as you bank by ATM, phone or
personal computer.
