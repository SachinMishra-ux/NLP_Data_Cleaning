While neither Madigan nor Hart brings the credentials that would
assure them a good seat at a Hollywood restaurant, both have
personal and professional connections to the Navy Yard.
Madigan, a stalwart in New York City's burgeoning new-media
industry, is a Brooklyn native and the grandson of a Navy engine
mechanic who, with the rest of his World War II crew, received a
presidential citation for work in the Navy Yard on the U.S.S.
Missouri.
Both men say New York Studios was the idea of Hart, whose set
design company, Delphi Studios, set up shop in a Navy Yard
warehouse in 1991.
The Navy Yard plan is far from the only studio production
venture being promoted at a time when demand for existing studios
and sound stages has never been more intense.
But entertainment industry executives said most, if not all, of
the other proposals are for studios that would be dedicated to
television, while the far larger studio envisioned at the Navy Yard
would also be suitable for movie production.
There is ample reason to be skeptical of any offer from the
speaker. To sabotage a debate in March, Gingrich tried to foist a
phony bill on the House. He later spoke of a vote in May, and now
he is talking July. It all adds up to a speaker on the run,
improvising to forestall the inevitable. The handshake Thursday
between Shays and Dick Armey, the majority leader, amounts to the
first firm promise of an actual vote.
The evidence is mounting, moreover, that the Shays-Meehan
legislation, co-sponsored by Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts,
is picking up steam. This page had urged that supporters of
Shays-Meehan, which would ban unlimited contributions to parties by
corporations, unions and rich donors, reject a separate bill
calling for a study commission. The fear was that the commission
might pass by a small margin, and that the Shays-Meehan bill would
have to pass by an even bigger margin to become law. On Wednesday
night the commission was actually defeated, 201-156, sending a
thunderbolt into Gingrich's office.
The speaker then began to worry that enough Republicans might
defect and join with the Democrats to reject a special rule
governing the debate, which would have allowed for the
death-by-amendment scheme. If the rule had gone down to defeat, the
speaker would effectively have lost control of his own House.
Democrats were angry that Shays agreed to support the rule in
return for Armey's promise to schedule a vote. But this is a game
that requires some gambles.
The defeat of the commission measure suggested that there are 30
to 50 moderate Republicans ready to declare their independence from
the leadership and join with perhaps 190 Democrats to put the
measure over the top this summer. It would then have to go back to
the Senate, where a clear majority are also on record as favoring
reform but saw it killed last year because of a filibuster under
the direction of Trent Lott, the majority leader.
We remain convinced that if the Shays-Meehan bill passes this
summer and goes back to the Senate, Lott will not be able to
control his members and make them dance to the tune of jangling
cash registers. There will, we predict, be enough Republicans in
the Senate as the election approaches to break the filibuster and
pass reform. It is anything but a sure thing, but this is no time
to give up.
