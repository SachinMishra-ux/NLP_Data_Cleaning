On the service side, help desk managers are training recruits,
often through role-playing, to manage calls say, how to end them
quickly without making a client feel rushed, or how to demonstrate
empathy.
Companies already give help desk employees fingertip access to
electronic manuals. To further ease demands on their help desk
staff, companies post answers to frequently asked questions on
their Web pages, or accept and answer queries by e-mail assuming,
of course, that the customer's computer is working.
And they are starting to give call center personnel access to
customer accounts help desk staff members at the IRS, for
example, will soon be able to view a caller's tax records and
customize their responses.
Companies are making better use of improved telecommunications
technologies. They are increasingly locating their call centers
near rich veins of potential employees, like suburban homemakers
looking for part-time work. And they are training their employees
to transfer callers with complex questions to specialists located
miles away.
The IRS, for example, will soon offer 24-hour phone access to
prerecorded answers to common questions. It also is assessing its
more than 25,000 help desk employees, and listing their skills in a
data base. The agency wants to spot which workers need extra
training, and it wants to start routing questions to the person
most likely to know the answers.
The unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent in May, from 8.1
percent in April. The office of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said it was
the city's lowest rate since January 1995. The figures still lag
behind the statewide unemployment rate, 5.7 percent, and the
national rate, 4.3 percent.
The mayor's office said 2,900 jobs were created in May, with the
largest numbers generated in sales and in business services, which
include secretarial and clerk-related jobs.
The banking industry, however, lost 100 jobs and the
communications and transportation fields lost about 500. Wall
Street's securities business showed a slight rise of 300 jobs. 
The July issue of Money magazine contains its 12th annual survey
of the best places to live in America sort of.
All this apparently prompted Money editors to rethink their
approach. Initially they were going to kill the survey, but then
decided to run it in a truncated form.
