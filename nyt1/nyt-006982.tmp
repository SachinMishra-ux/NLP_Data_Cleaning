DEAR NOT: Well, they're not aerodynamic enough to make decent
Frisbees. They're lousy as coasters. You can only make so many
cutesy clock faces out of them. Maybe hang them in the trees to
scare off squirrels? Find a used software shop and try to make a
few bucks? Give them to a school or church or charity and take a
nice tax deduction? Listen, you tell me what to do with them. I've
got a closet full of the things. But then, I plan to use them as
currency after the coming revolution puts the world in my evil
clutches. I guess I shouldn't have tipped you off about that.

WACO, Texas I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Bird look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
