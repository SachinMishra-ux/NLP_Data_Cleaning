Every batter in the Boston lineup reached base at least once
against Ponson and three relievers, with Darren Lewis breaking the
game open in the sixth by wrapping a two-run homer around the Pesky
Pole, making it 5-0. Lewis now has three home runs, two that have
curled into the right-field grandstand.
Mo Vaughn had his first three-hit game since May 8, while Mike
Benjamin, who will be alternating with Lou Merloni at second base,
had two singles, scored three runs, drove in two, and made two
terrific defensive plays.
The Red Sox, who begin a week's worth of interleague play with a
three-game set against the Mets this weekend, split a pair here
with the Orioles, whom they won't see again until right after the
All-Star break.
In their first extended stretch against their chief rivals in
the American League East the Yankees, Blue Jays, and Orioles the Red Sox went 6-7, including five wins in their last six games.
LOS ANGELES -- Debbie Weiss sat on the edge of her son Brian's
bed, watching him take out his anger and hurt on the keyboard of
his computer.
She wanted to walk over and hug him, cry with him. Instead, she
let him be, let him write it from the heart.
The woman from the hospice had left the house only minutes
earlier. It would be a few more days, a week tops, she had told
Debbie and Brian.
A week tops for 51-year-old Rick Weiss, slowly dying. And then
Debbie would be a widow, and Brian fatherless. Because of a bad
habit.
There would be no more nights when Debbie would look into the
den and see her husband and son on the couch together, watching one
of those science or nature shows they loved so much on the cable
channels. No bringing them dinner while they sat in front of the
computer working out some difficult science and math problems
together.
They weren't much for sports, this father and son, but they
bonded solidly in the mind.
