The company, which employs 300 people at its suburban Woodland
Hills headquarters and 800 overall, earned $3.5 million on revenues
of $43.2 million in the first quarter. It produces about 80 cameras
annually, leasing them to studios and producers through rental
agents, and dwarfs rivals Arriflex and Moviecam with a market share
estimated at 90 percent.
Perelman's deal provided no premium to shareholders, but offered
a debt recapitalization and other investments worth $150 million.
The transaction cut ownership of publicly held shares to 10 percent
from 19.5 percent, with Warburg and its managers owning the
remaining 18 percent.
LOS ANGELES A frustrating and disappointing month in
Indianapolis came to a bitter end for Chatsworth High product Mike
Groff this week.
After struggling to qualify and then finishing 15th in the
Indianapolis 500 17 laps behind winner Eddie Cheever Jr. Groff
was replaced as driver of the Jonathan Byrd/Cunningham Racing No.10
G Force Aurora, a car he felt was badly outclassed at Indy.
Groff said he felt the owners and crew chief blamed him for his
car's poor performance even though for the first few races of 1997,
he had the team in first place in IRL season points. But the real
problem, Groff said, was with the equipment.
In the race, Groff said his car's top speed was around 205 mph,
while other drivers were hitting the 220s and lapping him
repeatedly.
Groff said the problem was mechanical and the result of using
outmoded equipment as the owners tried to keep costs down.
So instead of putting money into making the car faster, Groff
feels, his team chose to blame the driver.
Groff several times told Byrd there was one way to find out if
he was the problem: Put another driver in the car. Twice before
Byrd took him up on the offer, bringing an outsider for testing.
This time, he's brought in Paul permanently.
That's OK with Groff, who is tied for 11th with Billy Boat in
season points with 56.
