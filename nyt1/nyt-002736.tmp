Creating such deals has proved harder than many investment
bankers predicted, and the securities have been so complicated that
they are offered only to professional investors. Nonetheless,
several Wall Street firms have set up entertainment subsidiaries,
like one at Nomura that raised money for Rod Stewart.
David Pullman, the investment banker who successfully sold the
Bowie and Motown deals, says he has more up his sleeve. Film
libraries, television syndications, literary estates all could be
turned into securities, says Pullman, a managing director at
Fahnestock Co., a New York-based securities firm.
One of the few who might qualify is Michael Jordan, of course.

WASHINGTON Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team. She
will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her.
Yet despite the fact that she comes from a well-off family, her
ability to carry this growing financial burden is open to question.
This is undoubtedly weighing on the 24-year-old Ms. Lewinsky and
her parents as legal activity on her behalf intensifies, and she
faces the critical decision of whether to cooperate with or fight
against the sex-and-coverup investigation of the White House by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, whom she retained last week, are
both senior members of a select coterie of Washington lawyers.
They've performed legal triage for a host of players in past
political scandals, from Fawn Hall, the secretary caught up in the
Iran-Contra affair, to Ken Parkinson, a Watergate figure whose
acquittal Stein won.
Their services do not come cheaply. Both men have hourly billing
rates in the range of $400 an hour.
And Ms. Lewinsky is already deep in the hole. When the final
bill is tallied, she'll likely owe more than $300,000 to her first
legal team, led by William Ginsburg, the family friend who served
as her principal lawyer until he was dismissed Tuesday; so say
Ginsburg and others familiar with the Lewinsky case.
Her expensive new retinue, worthy of her star billing in one of
the biggest controversies to rock Washington, is not limited to
Cacheris and Stein. There is also Nathaniel Speights, a Washington
trial lawyer who worked with Ginsburg and will remain on Ms.
Lewinsky's legal team. And a month ago Judy Smith, a respected
lawyer who once worked in the Bush White House, was retained by the
Lewinskys as family spokeswoman.
Ms. Lewinsky grew up in rarefied Beverly Hills and her father,
Bernard Lewinsky, who now lives in nearby Brentwood, is a
successful oncologist. Her mother, Marcia Lewis, long divorced from
her father, has apartments at the posh Watergate complex in
Washington and in New York. But despite being financially
comfortable amid trappings of wealth, family friends say, the
parents are not so rich as to absorb the six-figure legal bills
their daughter is incurring.
