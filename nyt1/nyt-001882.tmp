So, paying no attention to the highway numbers, we proceeded
east a bit, then crossed a bridge and continued on, the river on
our right-hand side now.
The landscapes broadened and changed. Warehouses and giant
factories gave way to rolling pastures, soft as green pillows,
mounting up from wooded valleys through which ran bright little
streams.
Sometimes we were near the river, and could spy it through the
trees. Other times the road bent away from the lowland and up into
the hills.
We passed through towns we'd never seen before, and whose names
we only half-thought we might have heard some of them places of
modest substance, others faint outposts of habitation that
sheltered fewer than 150 souls.
Proud signs told the year of their establishment, only a couple
of decades short of two centuries ago.
River ports, some of them surely were when the river was the
westward way. Then the world rushed on, and took prosperity with
it, and left those places hardly changed.
In one of them we saw three boys talking by the road. We stopped
to ask the way to the river, which could not have been 500 yards
from where they stood.
So that's what it's come to now. Boys growing up in a river
town, unable to get to the river without hoofing it five miles down
the road. Sam Clemens would spin like a top in his grave.
We did find the little sign, and took the way it pointed, up
over a railroad track and across the flats to a parking place and a
ramp for launching boats.
Only then could one appreciate the true power and swiftness of
the current. Its surface broken by little rips and whorls, the
great muscular Missouri came sliding past on its journey across and
down the continent as it has all these many thousand years.
