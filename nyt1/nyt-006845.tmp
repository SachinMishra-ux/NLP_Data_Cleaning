D'Amato, who is viewed as the leader of the state Republican
Party, called Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno last week to urge
him to allow a vote. But he did not lobby individual senators, said
Matt Foreman, executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda.
NEW YORK In 1972, Claus Reinisch had an idea for improving the
traffic flow in mid-Manhattan: confine pedestrians to one side of
the street when they are crossing major avenues. For example, they
would have to stick to the north side to get across southbound
Fifth Avenue. That way, he said, cars would have an easier time
turning into the avenue from side streets, and the backup of
crosstown traffic would be reduced.
Reinisch, who used to be the district manager of Community Board
1 in Manhattan, sent his suggestion to Dry Dock Savings Bank. Dry
Dock, requiescat in pace, was soliciting thoughts on how to unclog
New York's boulevards, sclerotic even then. In February 1972, it
printed 11 proposals in a full-page advertisement in The New York
Times, and one of them was Reinisch's.
If his idea rings a bell, it should. It is the very premise
underlying the ballyhooed pedestrian barriers that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani set up six months ago along 49th and 50th streets. Only
Reinisch thought of it 26 years ago.
Why mention this now? Certainly not to accuse the Police
Department's barricades guru, Chief Allan Hoehl, of stealing
someone else's brainchild. It is merely to keep the record straight no small matter, given how the Giuliani administration wants
everyone to believe that before it came on the scene, City Hall was
an idea-free zone.
With the mayor backpedaling on his plan to banish sidewalk
vendors from many street corners, it seemed reasonable to check out
other pillars of his vaunted quality-of-life campaign. Might the
bugler be sounding retreat on the midtown barricades, too?
It did not look like it Thursday. They were still there, all
right. So were the usual police officers standing guard, looking
bored and muttering off the record about their talents being
squandered.
That is not entirely accurate. While many New Yorkers still feel
that the barricades were shoved down their throats by a zero-sum
mayor who loves above all to get his way, the police hierarchy
pronounces itself satisfied.
Comparative police studies done in October and January, several
weeks after the, uh, facilitators were installed, found that the
average car speed along 49th Street had increased by 13 percent, to
6.2 mph, from 5.5. The increase was even bigger on 50th Street: 21
percent, to 5.8 mph, from 4.8.
A separate police survey in the barrier area, which stretches
from Third Avenue to Avenue of the Americas, showed that it took
18.2 minutes to make a round trip, back and forth, along 47th and
48th streets. The time for 49th and 50th streets was only 12.7
minutes.
