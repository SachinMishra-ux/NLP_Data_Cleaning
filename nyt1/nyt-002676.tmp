CHICAGO Indulge me while I clear out the Belmont Stakes
residue, but I do not see Michael Jordan and the Bulls fading in
the homestretch with another Triple Crown now in sight.
First of all, the trailer has to believe it has the ability to
catch up, but from the sight of the Utah Jazz in the second half
here on Sunday night, what we appear to have on our hands is a
pre-race favorite running without faith.
The Jazz did not quit Game 3 of the National Basketball
Association finals. They were dismissed from it. The only mail
delivered was the game itself, post-marked by the Jazz, Salt Lake
City. Just when people were forecasting photo finishes between
teams rated evenly matched, the Bulls wiped the Jazz out of the
picture, winning by 96-54 and taking a 2-1 series lead.
Same shots he always takes, the Jazz say. Same ones he always
makes. The problem with that rationale is that it fails to
acknowledge the psychological component of trying to wrest the
crown off Jordan's head. This is not the typical opponent. This is
not the normal setting. This is not the ordinary challenge, and
that not only goes for Malone but for the entire Utah team.
In the case of its best player, from the time Malone has been
playing basketball on the national level, he has been the
quintessential outsider, the muscular kid from a college, Louisiana
Tech, best known for its women's teams. As a pro, he has been
looked at by many of his peers as the Brother From Another Planet.
The African-American superstar who revels in the whitest of all NBA
markets, the big country biker and trucker who wouldn't be caught
dead dropping off a Mercedes with the trendy valet.
