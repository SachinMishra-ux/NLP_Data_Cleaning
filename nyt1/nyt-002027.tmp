Wijers touted the benefits package that accompanies the wage,
the on-campus cafeterias that serve food at a discount, and the 40
buses that shuttle workers to and from their jobs at no cost.
Puebla city leaders say having Volkswagen here helps curb the
phenomenon endemic in a nation where half the population lives
below the poverty level, and whose citizens must trek to the border
or Mexico City to seek work.
Volkswagen invested $1 billion to expand its plant to produce
the new Beetle. Some 26 suppliers, half of them international
companies, are located in an industrial park nearby.
On the manufacturing line, workers gingerly guide an
octopus-like spot-welder to tack some of the 3,000 welds that go
into the car.
At the finish line, an army of new Beetles in brilliant red,
yellow, blue and silver colors inch forward silently on nearly
motionless conveyer belts.
Here is one of the few places women workers are seen, touching
up the lacquer on the trunk locks with paintbrushes.
In a nearby building on the 30,000-acre Volkswagen campus, the
traditional Beetle is still built 80 percent of the work done by
hand.
A company official said the plant is the only one in the world
where body and chassis are built separately and then attached.
At about $7,500, with government subsidized tax-relief on 20
percent of the car's value, the traditional Beetle is the most
affordable new car in the Mexican market. The wee air-cooled engine
is attached to the Bug's caboose with four simple bolts, making
maintenance easy.
None of the Beetles produced here this year will be exported.
Instead, they will serve across the country as taxicabs, first cars
for middle-class boys, family autos for working-class parents, and
company vehicles for small businesses.
