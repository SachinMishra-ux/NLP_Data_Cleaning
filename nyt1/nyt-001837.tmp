Currently, Preston's favorite market is Britain, at 19 percent
of the fund; followed by France, 14 percent, and Japan, 11 percent.
The fund does not put its money to work in markets that might seem
to need it most. Just 10 percent of the fund is in emerging
markets. And it has not decided whether to avoid India or Pakistan
because of the nuclear tests.
NEW YORK A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Thursday that a
jury may be told of allegations of an earlier incident of police
brutality by Francis Livoti. The former police officer is charged
with violating the civil rights of Anthony Baez, a Bronx man who
died after he was choked during a 1994 arrest.
In the earlier incident, Livoti was accused of slapping and
choking a Bronx teen-ager named Steven Resto in 1993. Livoti was
later convicted in that assault, and sentenced to 7 1/2 months in
prison.
Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision to allow prosecutors to use
the Resto incident in Livoti's civil-rights trial is a setback for
the defense of the former police officer, who was dismissed from
the force last year.
In 1996, Livoti was acquitted on state charges in connection
with Baez's death in a trial in which a judge said that he would
not allow allegations of other cases of misconduct to be introduced
at trial.
Judge Scheindlin set a hearing for Tuesday to consider the third
incident prosecutors are seeking to use at trial. According to the
government's account in court papers, Livoti was in the process of
arresting one man, Manuel Bordoy, in 1990 by twisting his arm
behind his back, when a second man, Ivan Cruz, approached and told
Livoti that he was being unnecessarily rough. The two men were
returning home to the Bronx from a nightclub in Manhattan.
Livoti then punched Bordoy in the face twice, breaking his jaw
in three places, the prosecutors said. They said that Cruz was
charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, but those
charges were dismissed. Bordoy was also charged with resisting
arrest, but was acquitted following a trial, the prosecutors said.
Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, declined comment Thursday night
on Judge Scheindlin's ruling, but had objected earlier in court to
the government's attempt to introduce the 1990 and 1993 incidents.
London had argued that they could prejudice the jury as it weighed
the evidence against Livoti in Baez's death, the only incident for
which he has been charged with a federal violation of civil rights.
London said Thursday night that his client, who has pleaded not
guilty in the civil rights case, denies using any excessive force
in any of the incidents raised by the government. If convicted,
Livoti faces up to 10 years in prison.
NEW YORK A third of the 162-season is complete, and the New
York Yankees are on a pace to win 123 games after beating Tampa
Bay, 6-1, at Yankee Stadium Thursday night. But the Yankees will
have to play at least the next two weeks without star shortstop
Derek Jeter.
