Dedicated to Winston Cup's 33-date calendar, Stewart's swinging
schedule of racing two and three nights a week with midget cars,
BGN or IRL will stop, Gibbs has said, somewhat to Stewart's
chagrin.
As he says this, his name is atop the IRL points standings, and
yesterday at Texas Motor Speedway, Stewart pushed his neon yellow
Glidden Menards Special to a top speed of 223 mph in practice.
He smiles a smile that could sell a thousand cans of paint or
boxes of cereal. This chapter's not over. There's work to be done
this weekend.
The publicity has become white-hot and largely fawning, the kind
that a certain giant lizard couldn't buy with millions of dollars
of advertising earlier this year.
Reviewers have been ecstatic about the tale of Truman Burbank,
and Carrey's elastic mug has been on the covers of Time and
Entertainment Weekly magazines just in time to generate even more
interest.

LOS ANGELES -- Ronald Perelman, one of America's richest men,
completed his $600 million takeover of Panavision, the world leader
in supplying cameras to the motion-picture industry.
The deal, first announced in December, was approved Thursday at
a special shareholders meeting in New York City and leaves Perelman
with a 72 percent holding in Panavision -- the same level held by
venture-fund manager Warburg Pincus Capital, which had owned
Panavision for a decade.
Perelman has a fortune worth an estimated $6.5 billion and
controls Revlon, Consolidated Cigar, California Federal Bank and
Coleman. He has promised to increase Panavision's sales and retain
senior management, but has given no details yet.
