The remarks from Blatter have created an atmosphere of near
hysteria. Five red cards were shown Thursday. Any close call became
subject to the strongest judgment. And if Blatter wanted someone to
carry out his directive, he found the right person in Mexican
referee Arturo Brizio Carter during France's 4-0 victory over Saudi
Arabia.
Brizio Carter, who red-carded Italy's GianFranco Zola at Foxboro
Stadium in the 1994 World Cup, ejected Mohammed Al Khlaiwi of Saudi
Arabia early in the game and Zinedine Zidane of France midway
through the second half.
They won in style, exploiting great spaces in the Saudi defense
and their physical superiority, enhanced by the 18th-minute
expulsion of Al Khlaiwi for a tackle on Bixente Lizarazu.
The Saudis could not contain Zidane. And when the team needed an
injection of midfield inspiration, Youri Djorkaeff entered early in
the second half.
The second goal seemed inevitable. The Saudis, hampered by the
ejection and discouraged by France's back four, could not sustain
attacks. This allowed French defenders to advance. Lilian Thuram
made a strong run on the right side and drilled a cross through
Mohammed Al Dayea's hands. David Trezeguet, who had several chances
after replacing the injured Christophe Dugarry (right hamstring) in
the first half, finally converted with a header from the goal area.
The Saudis, a finesse team influenced greatly by the Brazilian
style, were unable to threaten with 10 men. When they attempted to
retaliate, their defense was exposed further.
France could have scored several more goals. The third came
after goalkeeper Fabian Barthez's long clearance was taken by
Henry, who outraced the tiring Saudi defense in the 35th minute.
Seven minutes later, Lizarazu scored off a play started by
Djorkaeff.
Zidane was ejected in the 27th minute after colliding with a
defender and appearing to step on him. Zidane will miss Wednesday's
game against Denmark in Lyon.
But instead of allowing the players and teams to be in the
spotlight, Blatter and his obsessions with refereeing are in danger
of upstaging them.
ST. LOUIS The Opera Theater of St. Louis has grown remarkably
since Richard Gaddes founded it in 1976 as a Midwestern oasis of
contemporary works, operatic rarities and standard repertory,
performed in English by young singers at the beginning of their
careers.
