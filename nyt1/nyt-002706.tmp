There was Real Quiet, cruising strongly on a four-length lead in
Saturday's Belmont Stakes after delivering the same devastating
blow that knocked out his opponents in the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness Stakes. He was surely cruising toward a place in history.
Then, in a twinkling of an eye, Real Quiet was suddenly running
in slow motion when compared to the charging Victory Gallop. His
commanding lead shrinking to three lengths, two, one and finally a
random bobbing of heads.
He still could have won it, of course. A jump before the wire,
his head was down and Victory Gallop's was up, as the two horses
were in asynchronous strides. A jump after the wire, his head was
in front, too.
But at the only time and place that counted, Victory Gallop's
head was down at the precise instant the horses flashed across the
Belmont Park finish.
Before the race, more than a few handicappers picked against
Real Quiet simply because he didn't have the same uncommon talent
as Secretariat or Seattle Slew or Affirmed. Some instead chose
Victory Gallop, others took Raffie's Majesty or even in a huge
stretch of logic Parade Ground. But the underlying theory was the
same: something unlucky or unexpected would occur to bring about
Real Quiet's defeat. The racing gods would see to that.
Real Quiet became the only horse in the 130-year history of the
mile-and-a-half Belmont Stakes to blow a four-length lead in the
final furlong.
But for these racing gods, here is a warning: your power will be
sorely tested in upcoming years.
As the modern thoroughbred continues to become increasingly
fragile due to indiscriminate breeding practices, horses such as
Silver Charm and Real Quiet will pop up with regularity. They don't
break watches or cause jaws to drop. But the more expensive,
fashionably-bred colts will continue to be exiled to the farm with
condylar fractures, bone chips or broken sesamoids only to begin
a stud career and beget even more unsound horses while the Real
Quiets of the sport will succeed by virtue of their durability.
Soon enough, one or more of these horses will slip through the
filter and win a Triple Crown.
The right knee Ramos had torn up twice in less than a year was
still as stiff and cranky then as the Tin Woodsman's. US men's
soccer coach Steve Sampson had his World Cup candidates in camp and
the clock was ticking. Sampson had said he'd wait for Ramos until
the 11th hour, but ...
