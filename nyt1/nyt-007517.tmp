They will be bound only by their nation's political pasts and
the ramifications tied to this day for more than six months.
And the only thing at their feet will be a soccer ball, which
they all know is in the same shape as the world.
Players and coaches from both sides have known the factors
involved in today's game for months. Only recently has the game
become even more pertinent in a World Cup sense both teams need a
victory to keep hopes alive for advancing in the tournament.
For 90 minutes today in Lyon, the world will watch the United
States and Iran battle on a soccer field not just because of things
like the Group F standings, the opportunity of earning points in
the round-robin and putting on a display of terrific soccer.
The world surely will watch as much because of what was put on
display nearly 20 years ago in Tehran, the 444 terroristic days,
the tense history and lingering ill feelings by people of both
nations.
In truth, the painful and bitter feelings between the nations
hardly have tempered over the years.
Diplomatic relations between the nations remain severed and it
was not until last week, perhaps in an effort to ease pressures for
today's game, that U.S. government officials even hinted at
relaxing its strong stance against Iran.
Both President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
addressed the U.S.-Iran game last week, using the opportunity to
mention the possible resumption of diplomatic relations with Iran.
Still, last month the U.S. State Department called Iran the
world's most active sponsor of terrorism and the Iranian government
has made no secret of its involvement in the game. National
officials will be present in the stadium today and all business
activity is expected to be suspended in Iran during the game.
The Iranian government also condemned a French television
station's showing of the movie Not Without My Daughter, which it
said depicts Iranians in a negative light. The government even
briefly hinted at pulling its team from the World Cup.
