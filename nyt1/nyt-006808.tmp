The Globe said Ms. Smith admitted the fabrications after being
questioned by Moore. Storin said the Globe initially had questions
about six columns and that Ms. Smith admitted to fabrications in
four of them.
In a noontime meeting Thursday, Storin and Taylor told the news
staff of their request for Ms. Smith's resignation.
A columnist at the Boston Globe, a Pulitzer Prize finalist,
fabricated people and quotations in four of her columns this year
and the newspaper has asked for her resignation, the Globe
announced Thursday.
In one case, she made up nearly an entire column about a woman
dying of cancer, the newspaper said.
Ms. Smith did not return messages left on her voice mail at work
and her home telephone was out of service. Her attorney, Ike
Williams of the Boston firm Palmer Dodge, also did not return
voice mail messages.
This was the second time in Ms. Smith's career that her
credibility has come under fire. As an editorial assistant at the
Chicago Sun Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a
concert that she had not attended. The newspaper ran a correction
but she was not dismissed.
The revelations about Ms. Smith come just a week after the New
Republic published the results of an investigation into the work of
Stephen Glass, one of its staff writers, whom it said had
fabricated parts or all of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote in two
and a half years.
The Globe, which is owned by the New York Times Co., said
Friday's paper would also include a news article about the
incident.
The Globe said it discovered Ms. Smith's fabrications two weeks
ago in the normal course of monitoring by senior editors. Under the
monitoring system, which Storin said he established two and a half
years ago, editors occasionally double check columnists' sources.
Richard Gulla, a spokesman for the Globe, said he did not know
whether other people in that article, such as Ms. Gibson's daughter
Carolyn were fabricated.
