One of the few things these two men share is friendship with Al
Gore and a fervent and not entirely disinterested desire to see him
president. Richardson, conscious that voters do not always reward
foreign policy expertise, has talked about running for governor or
senator in his home state of New Mexico, and some reports have Gore
eyeing him as a possible running mate. The post of energy secretary
will give him cabinet-level experience in a domestic issue, one of
particular importance to New Mexico, home of the Los Alamos and
Sandia nuclear laboratories. But he will lose political stature if
he uses the post to promote pork projects for his home state.
Much has been made of the rivalry between Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Holbrooke, who nearly had her job. It is
true that Holbrooke has a reputation as a difficult man who
sometimes verges on self-parody. But he is also seriously concerned
about the moral dimensions of foreign policy and the use of
American influence. He will be a valuable ally for Albright in
administration discussions and help her counter the Pentagon, which
has drawn President Clinton into bad decisions on such issues as
land mines.
Holbrooke will not charm his U.N. colleagues. Indeed, many U.N.
officials who worked with him when he successfully led the Bosnian
peace negotiations were put off by what they and numerous others perceived as his arrogance. But head-cracking has served him, and
American interests, well in the past. 
Cardinal John Joseph Carberry, who was a canon lawyer active in
the Roman Catholic Church's affairs and who led the Archdiocese of
St. Louis for 11 years, died on Wednesday at St. Agnes Home in
Kirkwood, Mo. He was 93.
Carberry was installed in 1968 by Pope Paul VI as archbishop of
St. Louis, the spiritual leader of more than 500,000 Roman
Catholics. He succeeded the late Cardinal Joseph Ritter and, like
him, made civil rights a central issue in his tenure. Carberry was
also a leading national figure in ecumenism with the Protestant
churches. He was named archbishop emeritus in 1979 at 75, the
retirement age set by the Vatican.
Carberry was considered more theologically conservative than his
predecessor as archbishop and was chosen with particular care by
the Vatican in light of an initiative by a group of diocesan
priests and laymen who wrote a program in 1965 that questioned
traditional doctrines and practices.
The pope elevated him to cardinal in 1969, when he was the
bishop of Columbus, Ohio, as someone likely to maintain discipline
among the rank and file and diocesan laity. In fact, he became
known in St. Louis as the creator of the Archdiocesan Pro-Life
Commission, a model for anti-abortion groups in church
jurisdictions around the United States. It was also noted that his
administration left the archdiocese in sound financial condition.
He was respected for his careful, scholarly preparation for
meetings. He took part in all four sessions of the Vatican Council
convened by Pope Paul XXIII and missed only a day and a half as the
council sessions stretched from 1962 to 1965.
Carberry sat in the two conclaves of 1978 that elected Pope John
Paul I and, after his sudden death, John Paul II, the first
non-Italian pontiff since 1523.
A native of New York City, Carberry began to study for the
priesthood at 15 at Cathedral College Seminary in Brooklyn. He was
ordained a priest of the Diocese of Brooklyn at the North American
College in Rome in 1929.
