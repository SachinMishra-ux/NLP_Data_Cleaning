The Reds made one final push in the ninth, getting two runs on
three hits against Wagner, who coaxed a double-play ball from
Greene to end the game.
ANAHEIM -- Steve Sparks has proven to be a mystery to the Texas
Rangers twice in the past week, and even his Angels teammates are
still trying to figure out where this guy came from.
The knuckleball pitcher gave up three runs and five hits in 6
1/3 innings to lead the Angels to an 8-3 victory over the Rangers
Saturday afternoon before 31,671 at Edison Field.
With the win, the Angels avoided falling behind the Rangers in
the A.L. West standings, instead increasing their lead to 1 1/2
games. Anaheim has won 17 of its last 20 games.
Sparks (2-0) made his Angels debut last Sunday in Texas and got
his first major league win in almost two years. But it didn't take
him nearly that long to get another.
After allowing three runs in the first inning -- two coming in
on Juan Gonzalez's 23rd homer -- Sparks settled down and held the
Rangers scoreless before being removed with one out in the seventh.
Meanwhile, the Angels took advantage of an erratic Todd Van
Poppel, the former No. 1 pick of the Oakland A's who began this
season in double-A. Van Poppel (0-1) lasted only two-plus innings
and got the loss. He gave up four runs and five hits, walking five.
Erstad hit Van Poppel's first big league pitch since Sept. 27,
1996 off the right field foul pole for a first-inning home run, and
the Angels didn't stop there. Dave Hollins (two-run double in the
third) and Phil Nevin (two-run single in the eighth) had the
Angels' other big hits.
However, the day belonged to Sparks, who didn't figure to be
much a part of this Angels team. But with injuries to three
starting pitchers, Sparks became the Angels' best option.
He missed all of 1997 as he recovered from reconstructive elbow
surgery, but was 0-8 in the minors this season. However, other than
his record, his numbers weren't that bad, and manager Terry Collins
noticed.
