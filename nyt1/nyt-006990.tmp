 Have military shipments through the Damascus Airport
diminished? It may be too early to get definitive answers, but we
should be communicating to Iran specific, doable achievable steps
that we want it to accomplish, on the way toward cutting off all
support for political violence.
 Is the declaratory policy of the Organization of Islamic
Conference, which condemned terrorism by all member states, holding
and being honored by Iran, the OIC's chairman for the next three
years?
The United States should send a USIA officer to the Swiss
Embassy, to initiate and coordinate exchange programs with Iran.
Former policymakers, professors, journalists, scientists, artists,
writers and representatives of non-profit organizations should meet
to discuss subjects of mutual interest. These will help break down
prejudices and misconceptions.
In addition, the United States should change its visa policies
for Iranians. We should end the current rules that collectively
punish Iranians through long delays for entire categories of visa
applicants. When a U.S. wrestling team traveled to Tehran in
February, they were treated respectfully by the Iranian government.
The United States reciprocated by treating Iranian wrestlers like
common criminals, delaying them for two hours at the airport so
they could be fingerprinted and photographed.
This was humiliating to them, insulting to Iran and directly
contrary to our interest in signaling a willingness to develop
better relations.
While we should take necessary precautions for security reasons
and for full observance of immigration laws, we should no longer
subject Iranians otherwise entitled to visas to long delays,
expenses and humiliation.

Honorable Lee H. Hamilton, member, U.S. House of Representatives,
before the Council on Foreign Relations, in Washington, D.C.) 
Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
