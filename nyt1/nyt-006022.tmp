Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
