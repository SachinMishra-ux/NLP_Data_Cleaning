You will have to decide if you are comfortable with those
numbers or would rather try to develop a second career that's
less stressful than your current one, yet that would still allow
you to save more than $2,000 a year toward retirement.
As for the portfolio itself, I think it's a little top-heavy.
Your two primary vehicles Vanguard Index 500 and PIMCo Stocks
Plus are very similar, investing in a blend of growth and value
large-cap issues. In the mid-cap arena, you achieve much the same
balance, opposing the mid-cap value-oriented American Century Value
with the mid-cap growth-oriented Putnam New Dimensions. But why not
diversify further?
First, I would suggest a solid small-cap fund such as Vanguard
Small-Cap Stock Index or Fidelity Low-Priced Stock. Second, I would
add a health care fund. The latter should be a solid and fairly
conservative health care fund conservative in that it gives only
modest weight to biotech or HMO issues; examples, among others,
would be Fidelity Select Health Care and Vanguard Specialized
Health Care.
I suggest moving 10 percent of the portfolio to each of these
sectors, giving the portfolio better diversification and reducing
reliance on the large-cap area.
Of course, you couldn't make such a move unless your 401(k)
offers small-cap and/or health care options, but you could make the
move after you change careers and move the 401(k) funds into an
IRA. With such a long time until retirement, those 2 1/2 years
shouldn't have a big effect on the long-term numbers.
Q. I am 62 and retired. My income is $70,000 a year, coming from
a government pension, Social Security, and dividends. My portfolio
is entirely with Vanguard, consisting of $158,000 in the California
Tax-Free Money Market fund, $173,000 in the California Tax-Free
Insured Long Term Bond fund, $136,000 in Vanguard Index 500,
$63,000 in Vanguard GNMA, and $195,000 in Vanguard Wellington (of
which $61,000 is in an IRA account). Does this mix of assets make
sense, and do you think staying exclusively with Vanguard is risky?
A. I think the portfolio is pretty conservative, but you don't
give me many hints about your appetite for risk, or how that
$70,000 of income relates to your needs.
Calculating 65 percent of your Vanguard Wellington positions as
stocks and then adding in the Index 500 holding, I come up with a
bit more than 36 percent of the portfolio in stocks.
I realize this number represents a pretty typical equity holding
for a retiree, but I believe relatively early retirees, and those
who have amassed significant savings pools, might look to a
somewhat higher number.
Early retirees want more stock because they can anticipate more
years during which inflation will be attacking the value of their
income stream, and affluent retirees look to a heavier stock
allocation because they usually can afford to ride out market
bumps.
