All other Iraqi oil exports are officially banned, but in
addition to the smuggling through Turkey and the Persian Gulf, Iraq
ships about 100,000 barrels of oil a day to Jordan. Jordan is
almost completely dependent on Iraqi oil, and the shipments to
Jordan have been informally accepted by the United Nations, U.S.
officials say.
Officials say the Clinton administration has never moved to curb
the smuggling, choosing instead to appease the Turks and the
Kurdish faction that controls the northern Iraqi territory and the
border crossing.
But the smuggling has clearly gone from being a minor loophole
in the embargo against Iraqi oil into a much more significant
source of income for Saddam and a well entrenched outlet for the
Iraqis.
With no American or allied effort to impede the traffic, between
50,000 and 60,000 barrels of Iraqi oil and fuel products a day are
now being smuggled along the Turkish route, Clinton administration
officials estimate.
Iraq also smuggles oil by water, to Iran, Dubai and other spots.
The Turkish and Persian Gulf routes smuggle roughly equal amounts
of oil and together account for up to 10 percent of Iraq's export
capacity, U.S. officials estimate.
U.S. warships, as part of a multinational force, have been
trying for several years to curb sea-borne smuggling, stopping some
barges and other vessels in international waters in the Persian
Gulf, administration officials said.
Earlier this year, Iran briefly curbed the Iraqi oil smuggling
trade along its waterways, but U.S. officials say the smuggling
through the Gulf route is now surging once again.
Administration officials say they believe that Saddam gets a
smaller cut of the profits from the Turkish operation than from the
Gulf operation. Kurdish leaders, Turkish trucking interests and
undoubtedly Turkish governmental officials along the border skim
off levies on the smuggling, U.S. officials say.
Administration officials say that Turkey has suffered so
severely as a result of international sanctions on Iraq that the
United States has decided to continue allowing the Turks to benefit
from Iraqi oil smuggling. In addition, administration officials
say, the smuggling benefits the Kurdistan Democratic Party of
Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, which taxes the oil as it passes
through its territory.
Yet Kurdish leaders from the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
complain that the Clinton administration's decision to allow
Barzani to benefit from the smuggling is enriching a Kurdish leader
who betrayed the United States less than two years ago.
