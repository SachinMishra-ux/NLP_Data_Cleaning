Displaying undraped body parts or using a vernacular term for a
child of unmarried parents is also seen as a method for marketers
to capitalize on the recent loosening of strictures in films,
television programs, music, greeting cards and other forms of
popular culture. Another factor is the increasingly detailed news
coverage of sexual topics ranging from the Monica Lewinsky matter
to the introduction of Viagra.
Some see the increase in foul language, bathroom humor and bawdy
imagery as an inevitable result of the evolution of mass
communications in American society.
Others condemn the changes as ploys by advertisers to get
noticed in the same manner that children shout dirty words in
public to embarrass their parents. Those critics view the trend as
distressing evidence of the further coarsening of public discourse.
Bodily functions from passing gas and urination to vomiting and
defecation are depicted and alluded to in advertising for shoes,
automobiles, software, games even food.
Then there is the more daring sexual imagery, extending far
beyond traditional realms like fashion and fragrance advertising
into such categories as shampoo, beer, video games, cars and
resorts. Some ads flaunt signs of arousal, others are festooned
with phallic symbols while still others present simulations of
sexual intercourse.
Though a good deal of this advertising is salacious, in many
instances the ads are meant to be playful, elbowing consumers in
the ribs with a wink.
That was the intent of a campaign last year to promote Bermuda
tourism. These ads showed a lovestruck couple enjoying a vacation
amid exaggerated symbols of amour: windsocks rising in a stiff
breeze, golf balls slowly being sunk, tall lighthouses looming over
landscapes.
The inclusion of questionable material in advertising is not
new, of course. Milder forms of sexual innuendo have been used in
advertising for decades. More recently, many smaller marketers
determined that they could overcome consumer ennui as well as the
handicap of being outspent by larger competitors by lacing their
campaigns with heavier doses of suggestive material.
For instance, ads by DeVito/Verdi for Daffy's, a chain of
discount clothing stores, mocked the prices charged by department
stores by arranging the sleeves of a shirt so that they made a
dismissive gesture that many consider offensive.
The push to get noticed by performing the advertising equivalent
of dropping one's pants has had larger consequences.
