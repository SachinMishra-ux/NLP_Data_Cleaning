But McShane acknowledged that the police had not bothered to
examine how much time pedestrians lose zigzagging their way now
along the barricaded streets. That, you would think, is worth
knowing.
If you have not been to midtown lately, traffic most days is as
congealed as a day-old lamb chop. Reinisch, for one, feels that
little has been done to crack down on the likes of double-parked
limos, tourist buses that sit forever in no-standing zones and
endless street fairs that back up traffic for blocks around.
SAN FRANCISCO On a day when it was difficult to birdie any
holes, Payne Stewart did some special things Thursday in the first
round of the U.S. Open. He birdied the final three holes. He made
just one bogey on the picturesque but lethal Lake course at the
Olympic Club, a place that left many competitors complaining,
cursing and putting some strange numbers on their scorecards.
So when the day had ended, Stewart was on top of his game and on
top of the leaderboard. Shooting a well-earned four-under-par 66,
Stewart held a one-stroke lead over the surprising Mark Carnevale.
Tom Lehman and Joe Durant were in a tie for third at 68, with some
golfers still on the course. Other prominent names like John Daly
(69) and Jasper Parnevik (69) lurked within contention.
The U.S. Open is more like a sprint than a marathon, so Stewart
had no plans to begin writing a victory speech. But for Stewart,
who has won two major championships, the 1989 PGA Championship and
the 1991 U.S. Open, Thursday's round was a pleasant reminder that
when at his best, Stewart can play with anyone.
Stewart spoke the truth. Some of the game's greatest players
were forced to struggle on some holes like weekend duffers. There
were big numbers all over the board, and some pre-tournament
favorites like David Duval (75), Ernie Els (75), and Davis Love
(78) were in danger of missing Friday's cut. Stewart's playing
partners, Curtis Strange (77) and Hale Irwin (80), both strugggled.
The course played as tough as advertised, with the 6-inch deep
rough, narrow sloping fairways and small greens making every hole
difficult. Heaven forbid if the wind starts to blow this weekend,
because that will make the Olympic Club even more of a torture
chamber.
For Stewart, playing steadily was a strong statement for someone
who has not won on the PGA Tour since the 1995 Shell Houston Open.
There have been times during the past two years when Stewart has
drawn more attention for his knickers than for his game, and it has
been frustrating for him not to play at the level he did during the
late 1980s and early '90s when he was one of the world's best. Yet,
at 42, Stewart has reached a time when his experience is an asset,
and he still has the ability to play at a high level.
Thursday was one of those days, and his finish was
extraordinary. Reaching the 16th tee at one-under par, Stewart
started his string of three consecutive birdies, a finish that may
not be equaled all week. At the par-5, 609-yard No. 16, Stewart hit
a 9-iron approach shot to within 8 feet, then made the putt. Then
Stewart went to the par-4, 468-yard No. 17, one of the toughest
holes in golf that is usually a par-5 for members. Stewart hit a
driver, then a 2-iron shot that stopped 45-feet in front of the
hole. Stewart lined up the long putt, hit it confidently and made
it. When the putt went in, Stewart shook his body as if he had been
electrocuted.
While Stewart's round was not a total shock, Carnevale's round
was. Carnevale played on the Nike Tour last year, and his best PGA
Tour finish this year is a tie for 41st place.
