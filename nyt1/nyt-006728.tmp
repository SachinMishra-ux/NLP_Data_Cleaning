WASHINGTON In a move certain to draw a presidential veto, the
Republican-controlled House approved legislation Thursday that
would allow parents to set up tax-free savings accounts to help
cover tuition at private or parochial elementary and secondary
schools.
The bill, which passed 225-197, would allow parents, relatives,
friends and even corporations to contribute up to $2,000 a year per
child into tax-free savings accounts that could be used for public
school expenses as well.
The legislation also expands the amount Congress approved last
year for college and other post-secondary education savings
accounts from $500 to $2,000 per child. The measure also included a
provision offered by Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, that will
allow the creation of tax-free, prepaid college tuition plans for
both private and public institutions.
The bill is expected to pass the Senate later this month, but
President Clinton has promised to veto it on grounds it would
undermine the public education system by encouraging parents to
send their children to private and religious schools. Clinton
appears at the moment to have the upper hand on the issue because
supporters of the savings accounts do not have the two-thirds vote
needed to override a presidential veto.
Archer also emphasized that the savings accounts could be used
to help with school-associated transportation costs and the special
needs of disabled children.
The savings account measure is expected to cost the federal
government about $1.6 billion over the next 10 years. Clinton and
other opponents of the bill say that the money could be put to
better use by building more schools to help reduce class sizes and
by hiring more qualified teachers.
So far, Republican leaders in Congress have blocked Democratic
bills that would fund the hiring of 100,000 more teachers and
increase the budget for new schools and expanded child-care
programs. Instead, they've made tax breaks through the savings
accounts the centerpiece of their education agenda.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, said one of the
goals of the GOP education agenda is to improve public schools by
making them more competitive. Offering tax breaks, he said, is one
way to accomplish that goal because it pressures public schools
raise their standards.
The Republican bill also includes $217 million for the creation
of a literacy program to help train more teachers in reading
instruction. It also encourages states through financial incentives
to establish regular teacher testing programs as well as merit pay
scales to help reward teachers for exceptional work. XXXXXXXXEND OF STORY
