Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru just beetles, just
one tree.
Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
