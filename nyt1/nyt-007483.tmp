Although proud provincialism has played a role in keeping the
national chains at bay, pure economics are involved as well. After
the oil bust of the late 1970s and early 1980s, national companies
were afraid to set up shop in New Orleans. Now that the city is
enjoying a rebound, it seems as good a place as any to do business.
To do that, PJ's plans to emphasize its uniquely New Orleans
spirit with one-on-one service and a slower pace.
Jordan argues that some local businesses have improved, thanks
to new competition. Tipitina's, which almost closed when the House
of Blues came to town, is thriving again by concentrating on
lesser-known, locally popular bands. They've even opened a second
location.
On the other hand, Terrence Fitzmorris, director of the Center
for the Study of New Orleans and the Mississippi River at Tulane
University, said he thinks people are overreacting.
Besides, he said, some of the outsiders were invited in. State
and local leaders OK'd plans for a huge, land-based casino near the
French Quarter. After a two-year battle, Harrah's Jazz Co., which
went bankrupt operating a temporary casino while building a
permanent one, has been given the go-ahead to finish construction
on the new casino and open for business.
JACKSONVILLE Mop-up duty doesn't lead to firefighting glory,
but someone has to do it.
Mop up means bulldozing street-wide paths through dense forest
to separate the charred land from the green, hosing down dry edges
and extinguishing sudden flares.
Kinkaid, a state forest firefighter, was joined Friday by five
firefighters from South Florida who pulled into their hotels at 2
a.m yesterday morning.
All told, 12 firefighters from South Florida three from Palm
Beach County have traveled north to help battle the raging brush
fires. They join crews from other states that are are monitoring
more than 7,000 square acres here.
The team split into day and night shifts. The first hooked up
around noon with crews from as far away as South Carolina and
Kentucky.
