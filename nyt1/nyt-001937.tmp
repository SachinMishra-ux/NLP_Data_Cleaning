Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
