The torrential weather was expected to dissipate overnight.
Weather Services Corp. predicts sun and breezy conditions on
Monday, with a temperature of about 75 degrees.
Monroe Spears, a critic, teacher and poet, died on May 23 at the
Southern Tennessee Medical Center in Winchester, Tenn. He was 82
and lived in Sewanee, Tenn.
He taught at the University of Wisconsin, Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, Tenn., and the University of the South in Sewanee,
where he edited The Sewanee Review from 1952 to 1961. In 1964 he
became Moody professor of English at Rice University in Houston,
where he taught until his retirement in 1986. He was a member of
the Fellowship of Southern Writers.
Most of LCI's top executives, including its chairman and chief
executive, Brian Thompson, will remain with Qwest. Thompson will
become Qwest's vice chairman.
The two companies have received all of the federal regulatory
approvals they require to complete their merger. Shareholders of
Qwest, based in Denver, and LCI are set to vote on the deal on
Friday. If Worldcom Inc.'s $37 billion acquisition of MCI
Communications Corp. wins government approval, the combined
Qwest-LCI will become the United States' No. 4 long-distance
telephone company.
Joseph Nacchio, who left ATT Corp. after he was passed over for
that company's top job, will remain Qwest's president and chief
executive. Philip Anschutz, the Denver oil and railroad magnate who
controls Qwest, will remain the company's chairman.
Anne Bingaman, LCI's aggressive regulatory affairs chief, is the
most senior LCI executive who is not a member of the team that
Qwest plans to announce Monday. Before joining LCI last year, Ms.
Bingaman ran the Justice Department's antitrust division. Since
leaving the government she has become an outspoken foe of the Bell
local telephone companies, proposing that they each be split in
half.
After completing the LCI acquisition, Nacchio will have 12
people reporting to him. Five of the people, including Lawrence
Bouman, LCI's senior vice president for engineering, will have come
from LCI.
Besides the ex-LCI executives, almost every member of Qwest's
top management team will have come from larger companies, including
ATT, Lucent, GTE and U S West. The telecommunications industry is
one of the few sectors in which talented executives routinely
follow career paths in which they move from larger to smaller
companies.
CHICAGO The game took 2 hours 34 minutes, and for Michael
Jordan, it had to feel like 15 brutal rounds, the way it felt years
ago for the aging Muhammad Ali. Jordan once flew the way the young
Ali danced, but at 35, against Larry Bird's swarming Indiana
Pacers, in the fourth quarter of a seventh game, Jordan had nowhere
to go but the clinches.
