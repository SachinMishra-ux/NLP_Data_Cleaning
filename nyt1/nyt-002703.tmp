But this doesn't feel like that. Working on nine days of rest,
the Jazz had to go into overtime to beat the weary Bulls in Game 1,
then lost Game 2 on their home court. Sunday night the series
shifted to the Windy City and there were stretches in the second
half when it looked like the Jazz were ready to roll over and quit.
It would be difficult to overstate the magnitute of the beating.
Chicago's vaunted defense completely smothered the Jazz. Chicago
led, 17-14 after one, 49-31 at halftime, and 72-45 at the end of
three. Imagine a team in the NBA Finals scoring only 45 points in
three quarters?
Malone came out of his shooting slump, connecting on eight of 11
attempts, but he rarely saw the ball in the second half and his
teammates shot 13 for 59 (22 percent) without him. Credit Jordan,
Scottie Pippen, and Ron Harper, the Bulls' Doberman Defense. Pippen
played free safety most of the night, destroying everything that
got in his path.
The worst patch for the Jazz came at the end of the third period
when Chicago's venerable veteran Harper (8 points, 10 rebounds)
grabbed a quick rebound and fired a no-look full-court pass to a
breaking Scott Burrell. The immortal Burrell slammed it home to
make the score 66-42. Utah came down and the frustrated Malone
immediately was flagged for elbowing Dennis Rodman in the face. It
was Malone's fourth foul, and the Jazz called time to remove him.
After the timeout, Jordan went into the low post and hit a
turnaround over Chris Morris. Then Rodman followed his own miss
with his only 2 points of the night and it was a hideous 70-42.
At the start of the fourth quarter, the Jazz had Shandon
Anderson, Howard Eisley, Antoine Carr, Morris, and the immortal
Adam Keefe on the floor. Not one starter. It was a message of
sorts. This one was over, and Sloan, a proud warrior, already was
thinking about the next game. Garbage time was particularly nasty
for the Jazz. Jordan's services were not needed.
The first period featured more bricks than one would find under
the ivy at Wrigley Field. The Bulls made six of 18, while the Jazz
struggled to hit seven of 22 shots.
Malone, after shooting 14 for 41 in the first two games of the
series, came out with something to prove and made his first five
shots, four of them jumpers. Unfortunately for the Jazz, no one
else in purple could do much of anything and Utah fell behind,
17-14, even though the Bulls shot only 33 percent. Utah was worse.
Take away Malone's 6 for 6, and the Jazz made only one of 16 shots
in the period.
It was a testament to Bulls basketball. Chicago missed 10 of its
first 12 shots, but still held serve. Luc Longley scored a
team-high 6 point in the first quarter, and Harper snagged six
rebounds. Malone had 12 of Utah's 14 points. John Stockton had the
other basket.
The first two games of this series provided no warning for
Sunday night's massacre. Now it's up to the once-favored Jazz to
see if they can respond with a victory in Chicago, or at least a
more noble defeat. Utah has too much experience, class, and dignity
to go out like this.
