I walked over and pulled out a top drawer. The old blond dresser
had been in the dining room for as long as I can remember and
I'll be 38 this fall. So ... maybe 30 years? 32?
I clicked one on and scribbled on a scratch pad. No ink. Nothing
but that horrible sound of dry tip against dry paper. And a maze of
colorless ruts. I clicked on another. Nothing. And another. And
another.
I picked out a couple of pocketknives and three compasses. Then
I turned the whole drawer upside-down in the trash bag.
The stuff in this one wasn't so worthless. A black-and-white
graduation picture of our cousin Jeanne from 1965. My third-grade
class picture. A VFW medallion. A miniature American flag. Lots
more pictures. Old pictures.
She carefully sorts what I pull out. One box for the personal
things. Another for stuff that can go to Goodwill or some other
place like that.
The third drawer goes faster. We're getting down a system here.
I pull, she sorts. She always has been the patient one, the
organized one.
At first I feel funny. Uncomfortable. Pretty soon, though, I get
caught up in the pulling. She doesn't say how she feels and I
don't ask because I'm afraid to. I don't want to know. Not yet at
least. Anyway, she's probably caught up in sorting like I am in
pulling.
She's not mean about it, but she sets me straight. Like when we
were kids. The older one telling the younger one exactly how it is.
She's right, of course. We have only just started. We have the
whole rest of the house.
For some odd, silly little reason, I feel so much better after
she says that. But my feeling better doesn't have anything to do
with the cleaning.
