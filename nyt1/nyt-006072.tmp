She had no interest in dilly-dallying around about the whole
thing OK, maybe didn't quite realize the mess she was in and
urged the doctors to open her chest and insert that tube so she
could waste no time in getting her treatments and getting down to
the business of getting better.
The other day Heidi Anderson, Bentley graduate and leukemia
survivor, was out dress shopping for something to wear this weekend
for a dinner in Marco Island, Fla., where she will be honored as
the winner of the Honda Inspiration Award, presented each year to a
collegiate woman athlete who has overcome great physical adversity.
Her once straight blond hair grew back darker and more curly and
is long and she plans on growing it longer. She is two and a half
years out from the bone marrow transplant she received after it
became clear the chemotherapy wasn't going to take care of her
leukemia. She has heard that some doctors say that three years out
and you're considered cured, others that it's five years. And even
then they hedge and say you're 98 percent cured.
Numbers in the past couple of years have been more about beating
the odds the chance of survival was 30 percent originally, 30
percent again in the bone marrow transplant, but then there was a
chance of surviving the transplant and coming out of it with some
other ailment than they have been about the numbers that used to
matter. The number of kills she had as an outside hitter, the
number of service aces, the scores of games took a back seat.
She is living life the way she intended before leukemia
interrupted it for a year and a half. She graduated from Bentley
last month and in August starts her training with the Marriott
Corporation as an assistant controller. Her boyfriend, Matt Genest,
the one who cut her hair, the one she met on the first day freshmen
reported to Bentley, the one she borrowed the Berwick Academy
baseball cap from to cover her bald head also missed a year and a
half of school.
He moved in with her family in Jamul, Calif. to help when she
was sick. They both doubled up on courses to actually get out ahead
of schedule, considering the time they missed, and both graduated
with honors.
She was a key member of the Bentley volleyball last fall, was
elected captain by players who barely knew her and helped the team
to a semifinal finish in the Northeast 10 Conference, ironically
the same place they ended up days before her cancer ordeal began.
Anderson made the All Conference team as a freshman and helped
her team to the NCAA Northeast Regionals. She came back the next
season and coach Sandy Hoffmann asked her to be more of a team
leader. She was.
But as the season went on her joints ached more and more and she
became more and more sick. Doctors thought she might have a virus
and had her sit out late in the season. She talked her way into
playing in the conference tournament.
Monday, the doctor called and said she wanted Anderson to have
more tests with a specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center.
