Sandwiched around an exciting 3-2 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals, the Los Angeles Dodgers traded Hideo Nomo to the New
York Mets and learned that they might have lost left-fielder Todd
Hollandsworth for the rest of the season with a shoulder injury.
And now they head to Seattle, ground zero for the failed Randy
Johnson trade, where they open a three-game interleague series
tonight with the Mariners.
They feel pretty good winning for the second consecutive night
after dropping four in a row. They feel better about seeing Chan Ho
Park regain his confidence by pitching seven strong innings on a
night he didn't have his best stuff.
And best of all, they got clutch hitting from Charles Johnson,
who won it in the ninth with a two-out single after Eric Karros
tied it in the eighth with his sixth RBI in two games.
They finally unloaded Nomo, who had demanded to be traded. The
Dodgers receive two pitchers: hard throwing starter Dave Mlicki,
who will join the team in Seattle and could start in that series,
and reliever Greg McMichael. The Dodgers also gave up reliever Brad
Clontz, who was pitching at Triple-A.
Before the game, the club learned that Hollandsworth, who was
hitting well for the first time since winning the 1996 Rookie of
the Year Award, had torn cartilage in his left shoulder and will
undergo surgery Thursday.
But for the players, the game was the thing. And for Johnson, it
was particularly gratifying. He got Park through a long outing and
continued his hot hitting. Johnson is 10 for 23 with three homers
in a six-game hitting streak that started after an 0 for 35
stretch.
The victory went to Scott Radinsky (2-2), who has a win and a
save after blowing two save opportunities over the weekend.
He was coming off a five-RBI game Wednesday night, but he was
booed when he had trouble running out a sixth-inning grounder
because of his chronically sore left knee. Later, when a foul pop
landed near him, Karros couldn't dive because of the knee that
forced him to miss 22 games to begin the season.
Even when he pitched well last Friday, the Dodgers bullpen blew
the lead in the ninth and lost the game in the 12th.
