That Yoshii was not at his sharpest was evident early, when
Guerrero homered with two out in the first inning and then White
went deep to lead off the second. But Yoshii was able to hold the
Expos scoreless for the next three innings, while the Mets
attempted to figure Vazquez out.
The 21-year-old right-hander, who had a 1-6 record and a 6.00
earned run average, scattered four hits on his first two times
through the Mets' order.
The third time through was the charm for the Mets, however. Five
consecutive hits a Matt Franco single, a Mike Piazza double, a
John Olerud single for two runs, a Carlos Baerga single and an
Alfonzo double for a third run built a 3-2 lead for the Mets. But
Ordonez failed with the bases loaded against reliever Shayne
Bennett, and then Yoshii let the lead slip away.
The Expos sent 11 batters to the plate in their sixth. Yoshii
opened the inning by getting Jose Vidro on a called third strike.
But Guerrero followed with a double, Brad Fullmer singled him to
third and White walked on a 3-2 pitch to fill the bases.
The next batter, Grudzielanek, rifled a run-scoring single to
right on the artificial turf, past a diving Baerga at second base.
Lopez charged the ball sensing a play at home. Instead, the ball
kicked off his glove and went to the wall. Three runners scored,
Grudzielanek wound up at third base and the Expos had a 5-3 lead.
By the time the inning was over, it was 7-3 with these numbers:
three hits off Yoshii; five walks shared by Yoshii and Turk
Wendell; one botched rundown after Wendell had picked Chris Widger
off first base, and Lopez's two-base error.
The Mets did answer with another three-run rally in the seventh
as Piazza Piazza provided a run-scoring double, his second of the
game, and Baerga singled for two runs. It pulled the Mets to within
7-6.
But Guerrero robbed Alfonzo of extra bases and what would have
been his fourth hit of the game with a running catch in
right-center field to end the uprising, and the Expos held on to
win.
NEW YORK Three years before a New York City police officer,
Francis Livoti, was accused in the choking death of Anthony Baez
during a 1994 arrest in the Bronx, his commanding officer
recommended that he be transferred because of the number of police
brutality complaints against him.
The department did not follow the recommendation of Deputy Chief
William Casey, then commander of the 46th Precinct in the Bronx,
who described his concerns about Livoti in a recent deposition in a
pending civil lawsuit against the Police Department by the Baez
family.
