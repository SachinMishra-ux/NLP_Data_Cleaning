Had the gas used been nerve gas, they said, helicopter pilots
and bomber pilots would have been warned and equipped with gas
masks, which did not happen.
Georgia won the 14th annual meeting 23-21 Saturday night on
Chance Gwaltney's 33-yard field goal with no time remaining. The
victory shaved Florida's advantage in the series to 6-5-3.
That has given cause for game organizers to consider alternative
formats for the game. The most recent option being discussed is to
conduct the game in conjunction with the Peach Bowl in late
December.
Stevens said that option is on the agenda for discussion in a
meeting with Peach Bowl organizers in the next week to 10 days.
There are numerous complications, however. Foremost is a Georgia
High School Association rule that makes players ineligible to play
any other high school sports if they participate in an all-star
game during the academic school year. Florida has a similar rule
but it only jeopardizes eligibility in the same sport.
Injuries remain a serious concern of both college coaches and
the game's organizers. The University of Florida had a particularly
bad week this year as two of its signees suffered major injuries.
John Capel of Brooksville, Fla., generally considered the top
receiver prospect in the country, dislocated an elbow in practice
and had to have surgery to repair nerve damage. Albany's (Ga.)
Chucky Marks suffered a knee injury in Saturday night's game. As a
result, both players may have to sit out their freshman seasons
with the Gators.
NEW YORK After almost eight decades of charges and
countercharges, investigations, debates, protests and tears, the
question of whether Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (or one of
them) committed the crimes for which they were executed in August
1927 remains in dispute. Historical consensus seems to have been
reached, however, that their trial was marred by the biases of the
period and by dubious prosecutorial tactics.
Attention is rightly drawn to the nation's post-World War I Red
scare, when radicals like Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian anarchists,
were rounded up, beaten and deported. The evidence against the two,
arrested in a payroll robbery and murders in 1920 in Braintree,
Mass., was contradictory; the prosecution played heavily on their
radical beliefs, and the judge reminded the jury of its duty to God
and country.
In 1977 Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts,
issued a proclamation apologizing for the conduct of the trial
without taking a position on the men's guilt or innocence. That
combination of agnosticism toward the crime and indignation toward
the process reflects current historical opinion pretty well.
In a bid to make computer networks as common in homes as they
are in offices, 11 high technology companies including IBM, Lucent
and Compaq have teamed up to develop standards for systems that
transmit data at high speeds over the copper telephone wiring
inside almost every house and apartment.
The companies intend to announce the formation of the group,
called the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance, Monday at the
Digital Living Room conference in Laguna Hills, Calif.
