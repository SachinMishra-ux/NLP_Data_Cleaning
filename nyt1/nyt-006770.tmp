Twice in this decade, nine of the All-Star jockeys shared a
starting gate. All except Krone, Hawley and St. Julien rode in the
1994 Kentucky Derby, won by McCarron aboard Go for Gin. And all
except Pincay, Hawley and St. Julien were in the 1995 Derby, which
went to Stevens on Thunder Gulch.
But in those major races, the emphasis was more on horses than
jockeys, as it should be.
Tonight, the jockeys will be in the spotlight and the horses
they ride will receive little attention, surprisingly. In fact,
when Lone Star racecaller John Dooley describes the action, he will
again call the names of the riders rather than the horses.
A total of $100,000 in prize money will be distributed, of which
$25,000 goes to the winning jockey and a guaranteed $5,000 to each
rider regardless of finish. Additionally, 1 percent of the total
nationwide betting on the four races will be donated to the
disabled riders' fund administered by the Jockey's Guild.
Because so much depends on the luck of the draw, jockeys regard
the event as more of a showcase than a true championship.
The latter could describe Stevens' plight tonight. He benefited
from a good draw last year, but this time his best mount is Dread
Me Not, the 5-to-1 third favorite in the second race. His other
three mounts are all held at 10-to-1 or higher in the program.
On the other hand, All-Star newcomer Sandy Hawley, who will
retire next month, might have received a going-away present in the
draw. He picked up Little Guy, a solid second-race favorite, and
also has a chance to win or pick up runner-up points with
consistent First Gold in the fourth race.
Jockeys get 12 points for a victory, six points for second, four
for third and three for fourth.
Much of this is conjecture, of course, but legendary 51-year-old
Pincay appears to have gotten the worst of the draw for a second
consecutive year.
Pincay didn't score a point last year. And unless he can pull a
rabbit out of his hat with Pops' Po Boy from the unappealing No. 12
post position in the 1 1/16-mile second race, he might not score
tonight, either.
