Paul Spoljaric fed Darin Erstad a pitch that was hit back up the
middle, slightly to the pitcher's right. Out of instinct, Spoljaric
took a stab at the ball and knocked it toward Huson, who fielded it
barehanded but threw late to first. No one covered third base,
allowing DiSarcina to keep running, putting runners on first and
third with none out instead of nobody on with two outs.
Cora, closest to the ball, pointed at it but did not give chase.
Griffey charged in but arrived too late to make the catch.
Anaheim loaded the bases when Spoljaric, fielding pinch-hitter
Craig Shipley's bunt, threw late to third base. Bobby Ayala, whose
sinker is supposed to produce ground balls, entered with a 5-4 lead
and promptly gave up long sacrifice flies that produced the tying
and go-ahead runs.
The first-place Angels, playing with supreme confidence, treated
Ayala rudely in the eighth inning, scoring five runs. Besides
surrendering five hits in the inning, Ayala uncorked a wild throw
to third base.
The bad news: most of the ticket buyers probably have been
reading, watching and listening about a team that has lost five
straight and 14 of its past 17 games to fall into the division
cellar.
ANAHEIM, Calif. The rock formation in left-center field at
Edison Field provided a perfect setting for the Mariners'
three-night(mare) visit to the Anaheim Angels' refurbished home.
In a game Mariner starter Jamie Moyer pitched well enough to end
the free-falling defending division champions' most recent skid,
two more errors by third baseman Russ Davis and two of the most
horrific innings of the season turned into an 11-5 debacle before
30,268 fans.
Left fielder Glenallen Hill dropped a line drive in the first
inning that was ruled a hit, leading to a run that negated Ken
Griffey Jr.'s league-leading 27th home run in the top of the
inning.
Moyer shook that off, got out of the inning, and happily sat in
the dugout when Alex Rodriguez's bases-loaded single, Griffey's RBI
hit and Jay Buhner's long sacrifice fly scored four runs in the
third inning.
Angels third baseman Dave Hollins drilled a sharp grounder to
Davis with one out and one on in the third inning, but instead of
catching the ball and starting an inning-inning double play, Davis
leaned over and the ball scooted through his legs. That led to the
Angels' second run.
