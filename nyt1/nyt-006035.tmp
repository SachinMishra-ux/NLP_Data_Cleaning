He also intends to plug all 1,600 housing units on the Presidio
into this fiber net, so folks at home will be able to hold
video-conferences with their offices or with other Presidio
families.
This isn't just some bureaucratic dream. Before he came to the
Presidio, Meadows managed the conversion of Denver's Lowry Air
Force Base. There, he created a fiber town with 4,000 wired homes
and many multimedia enterprises.
Meadows expects to encounter envy and opposition from those not
lucky enough to land in this high-tech Garden of Eden.
That's the gist of a new survey conducted by the Institute for
the New California, a public policy group in Walnut Creek. The INC
reached this conclusion after polling a scientific sample of
adults.
The Institute defined wired workers as wage earners who worked
outside the home, used network-connected PCs on the job, and were
relatively free to organize their own workdays.
Pollster Mike Hais said the survey respondents who fit this
definition identified themselves as independents, Republicans and
Democrats, in that order.
Coincidence or not: The Institute was co-founded by Morley
Winograd, a former Bell executive who now serves as senior policy
adviser to Gore.
 Bookmark it! CMP, the Long Island-based trade-press
publisher, soon will unveil a new Web site that makes it easier to
find electronics industry information.
CMP has taken the contents of dozens of its pubs among them EE
Times and Windows magazine and made it accessible from a single
page. It combines a search engine with a Yahoo-like set of
categories that point to sub-topics like semiconductors, PCs,
finance, etc.
Other Web sites, notably Cnet and ZDNet, put tons of great
tech-type info online. But I think CMP has a better way to let
people quickly zero in on just what they want.
