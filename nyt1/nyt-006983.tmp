That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
No I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on my modern
social developments.
That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.
The book, first issued last year in hardcover, is built around
profiles of media moguls such as Murdoch, TCI's John Malone, Time
Warner's Ted Turner, Microsoft's Bill Gates and Viacom's Sumner
Redstone the toll-takers, construction bosses and salvage-truck
operators on the information superhighway.
Auletta's M.O. is to spend time in board rooms and corporate
jets with members of the billionaire boys' club, seeing them
up-close and personal and, he hopes, unrehearsed. In the process,
he tries to glean insights into how they do deals and where they're
likely to go next on the Infobahn.
Auletta says he realizes that top CEOs might give him access to
their meetings, meals and tete-a-tetes because they think they can
co-opt him for their own self-promoting purposes, but he thinks
it's worth taking the risk.
