Though police did not take a high-profile on the street, they
had kept most community centers from showing the game and most
watched it at home.
At the north Tehran center where the game was shown, those
attending were not permitted to carry cameras to record the
gathering, apparently to discourage excessive celebration in the
event of a victory.
TEHRAN, Iran After just a couple dramatic soccer goals, one of
the most restrictive countries on earth could not be restrained.
Throngs of Iranians millions by some unofficial estimates took to the streets and clogged them at 1:30 a.m., blowing horns,
dancing and chanting immediately after their national team's 2-1
defeat of the United States in the World Cup soccer tournament in
Lyon, France.
At 3:30 a.m. in Tehran, a city where it is usually difficult to
find a restaurant open after midnight, car horns were still
blaring.
The fever over the game illustrated the extremes of Iran's
culture in flux, where women can still be arrested unless they
cover their hair with scarves, where alcohol is prohibited and
where the national image centers on its mantle as a country for the
persecuted downtrodden.
Earlier, at a community center in an upscale north Tehran
neighborhood, about 80 fans became irate when police entered and
shut off the televised game broadcast that was taking place on a
big screen.
Organizers of the showing, after ten minutes of soccer action
had been missed, convinced the police to let the broadcast
continue. They then flashed lights on and off as they implored the
crowd to hush whenever cheering got loud, warning that the police
could return any minute.
Minutes after the victory, however, smiling police leaned on
their cars cross-armed, watching youths climb tall street lights in
celebration. Thousands of police had been deployed across the city,
but there were no immediate reports that any interfered with the
celebrations.
They have closely followed the cautious offers of dialogue that
their new moderate President Mohammad Khatami has exchanged with
President Bill Clinton.
