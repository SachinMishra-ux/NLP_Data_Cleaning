At 102, meanwhile, Milton Garland puts in a 20-hour week as an
engineer at a refrigeration plant in Waynesboro, Pa. In March,
Garland was honored at the White House as the country's oldest
worker.
One of the difficulties in studying centenarians, besides
recruiting subjects, is proving their age. In Georgia, for example,
where Poon recently completed his study, official birth records did
not start to be compiled until the 1920s. Names and birth dates
were passed on in family Bibles, from generation to generation,
Poon said. In addition, he said, some people exaggerate their age
out of pride, or a wish for prestige.
He and other experts say that there are no records to
substantiate the claims of 115-year-olds in Soviet Georgia, and
that there is evidence to suggest that such people are using birth
certificates of relatives a generation or two older.
The oldest person for whom there is extensive documentation was
Jeanne Calment of Arles, France, who died in August 1997 at age
122. Miss Calment rode a bicycle until she was 115, and lived in
her own apartment until age 110, when she moved into a nursing
home.
And, not surprising, according to the studies and anecdotal
reports, one thing centenarians do not do much of is worrying.
Mrs. McEathron, who grew up on a farm and reared two children
alone during the Depression after her first husband left her, said
her later years had been the best ones. It was not until her eighth
decade that she was able to stop working, as a restaurant hostess
and hotel cashier.
Doubts raised about the accuracy of a recent article that was
published in Time magazine but was written by Cable News Network
journalists are serious enough that Time's editors have ordered a
further investigation.
The article asserted that the U.S. military dropped lethal nerve
gas on a Laotian village in 1970, during the Vietnam war, as part
of a secret mission to kill American defectors.
The issue of Time that appears Monday carries a letter to
readers from the managing editor, Walter Isaacson, telling them
that the magazine is now doing its own reporting on the matter and
will correct any mistakes or clarify any disputes in future issues.
Within hours of the June 7 broadcast, CNN's report was
criticized as false, the producers were accused of ignoring or
suppressing evidence that undercut their poison-gas thesis, and
Time's rival, Newsweek, had begun work on an article that, when
published the next week, would be an attempt to rebut much of the
report.
