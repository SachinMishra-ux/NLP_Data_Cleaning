Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets
from Asia. A longer runway would bring more tourists, and would
also help business.
Gary Gifford, the president of the Maui Land Pineapple
Company, points out that the short runway makes it more difficult
to get fresh pineapples to market.
On the west coast of the island of Hawaii, a new international
airport generated a 26 percent increase in tourist arrivals in
1997. But the anti-growth forces will not countenance a bigger
airport on Maui and, so far, they are winning.
