Now, six hours later, Mike Pegram, the Mount Vernon owner of
Real Quiet, stood at the end of a ballroom in a Long Island hotel,
surrounded by a bottle of beer, a plate of shrimp and 300 of his
closest friends.
If there was an ache deep within Pegram at having come so close
to getting his maligned horse engraved in the sport's history only to lose so breathtakingly in the Belmont Stakes he didn't
betray it.
Pegram bounced in and out of the party he was throwing to hug
old friends and trade war stories.
They were there from Princeton, Ind., the place of his youth,
old buddies like Rick Wheeler and Chuck Winters, whose fathers knew
his father.
They were there from Mount Vernon, folks like Robbie Slayton,
who caught Pegram's Little League fastballs from age 8 in
Princeton, and then moved out to join him in 1979.
Michelle Slayton, his wife, was there. Twenty-two years ago, she
interviewed with Pegram for a job on the counter crew at the
McDonald's in Oak Harbor. Today, she's director of operations for
the string of 22 fast-food outlets Pegram owns north of Seattle.
Many of Pegram's longtime Mount Vernon friends were on hand,
people like former Skagit County district court judge John Kamb and
his son Tommy, an attorney.
Bob Baffert, Real Quiet's trainer, was there, and so was jockey
Kent Desormeaux. Bob and Beverly Lewis, owners of the 1997 Belmont
bridesmaid, Silver Charm, also made it.
For everybody, there was still a sense of numbness at what they
had seen a few miles to the west at Belmont. A horse losing the
Triple Crown by a nose? That's like Mark McGwire being denied Roger
Maris' home run record on his last at-bat of the season on a
leaping catch over the outfield wall.
It will forever be alleged in many quarters that Desormeaux
didn't give Real Quiet the best ride, that he charged too early on
the demanding 1{-mile oval, and then he initiated the bumping.
