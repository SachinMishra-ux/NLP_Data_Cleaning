Thousands of patients who were taking a blood pressure drug
called Posicor which was withdrawn from the market on June 8
because of dangerous interactions with many other medications are
at risk of life-threatening reactions if doctors abruptly switch
them to alternate medications, researchers warned Thursday.
An estimated 200,000 Americans, and 400,000 worldwide, were
taking Posicor before the manufacturer withdrew it earlier this
month. The drug had been approved only a year earlier for high
blood pressure and chest pain.
Posicor's manufacturer, Roche Laboratories, has recently
confiscated supplies of Posicor from pharmacies and hospitals. But
an unknown number of patients still may have unused supplies of the
drug.
Moreover, some specialists said, many doctors may not realize
the dangers of switching abruptly from Posicor to another drug of
the same type, known as calcium channel blockers.
It was already known that Posicor, known generically as
mibefradil, should never be taken along with two widely prescribed
calcium channel blockers called verapamil (brand names Calan,
Isoptin or Verelan) or diltiazem (Cardizem).
However, the authors of the upcoming AMA Journal report said no
one had realized the risk of switching to other calcium channel
blockers before Posicor had been flushed from patients' systems.
Among those other drugs are nifedipine (Adalat or Procardia),
felodipine (Plendil), and nimodipine (Nimotop).
He added that patients who had been taking Posicor should
probably not be taking another heart and blood pressure drug called
a beta blocker, such as timolol (Blocadren) or propranolol
(Inderal), for at least 14 days after stopping Posicor.
The problem, experts said, is that Posicor lingers in the body
for days. Roche issued a letter to doctors a week ago advising a
delay of seven days after discontinuing Posicor before beginning
treatment with most other calcium channel blockers or beta
blockers.
Horowitz said patients could safely be switched from Posicor to
other types of blood pressure drugs, called ACE inhibitors or
angiotensin-II inhibitors. However, Dr. Irene Gavras of Boston
Medical Center said it most patients should wait for Posicor to be
washed out of their system before beginning any other drug.
Acting commissioner Bud Selig has not decided when to call the
owners together to elect him commissioner, a Major League Baseball
official said Thursday, but the meeting will very likely take place
after the All-Star Game.
