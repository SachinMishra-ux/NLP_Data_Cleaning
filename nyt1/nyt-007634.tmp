One woman, pressing the limits by joining a spontaneous all-male
parade, shouted her thanks to the bemused and for once not feared police.
But generally, the jubilation was more about a love for soccer
and a needed emotional release in what can be a sterile society.
The hard-fought first round battle in Lyon was more than just a
confrontation between two global foes. Rather, the victory provided
a chance for Iranians to celebrate a slow emergence from world
isolation and to test freedoms cautiously advocated by a
charismatic new president.
Earlier Sunday, a the second day of the work week here, many
Iranians were disappointed to see their hard-line parliament
impeach one of the key reformers in the cabinet of President
Khatami. It was the latest maneuver in the struggle between the
country's conservative and moderate factions.
But, the Iranian soccer team, the first to make the World Cup
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, won the day with its triumph.
The street celebrations were the third in just over a year others were held when the team qualified for the tournament and
after the election of Khatami.
The night began calmly. Traffic was heavy as people prepared for
the game and it seemed that boys were playing soccer in makeshift
goals on nearly every vacant lot or alley.
Though police did not take a high-profile on the street, they
had kept most community centers from showing the game and most
watched it at home.
At the north Tehran center where the game was shown, those
attending were not permitted to carry cameras to record the
gathering, apparently to discourage excessive celebration in the
event of a victory.
WASHINGTON Five months after investigators began exploring
allegations of a sexual relationship between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, new lawyers for the former White House intern have
returned to the same standoff with independent counsel Kenneth
Starr that her previous attorneys confronted.
