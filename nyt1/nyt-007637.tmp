Duva has been particularly successful in signing and cultivating
U.S. Olympians. Main Events landed four gold-medal winners Whitaker, Mark Breland, Meldrick Taylor and Tyrell Biggs and
Holyfield from the 1984 team.
Most significant, he lost three people very dear to him: Former
heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, his close friend, was killed
in a plane crash in 1969; his wife, Enes, died of multiple
sclerosis in 1986; and his son Dan died of brain cancer in 1996.
However, he has remained an always-positive, high-energy,
laugh-a-minute person who is a delight to be around.
He loves to tell stories and people love to listen, whether the
tales are true or fantasy.
And there are the more poignant stories, such as when Holyfield
knocked out Buster Douglas to win the heavyweight title his
greatest moment in boxing.
He had always told himself that if one of his fighters ever won
the heavyweight title, he'd dedicate it to Marciano.
And Duva's stories and humor aren't reserved for a select few:
He seems to have time for anyone and everyone in spite of his
hectic schedule.
He won't hold back when he has something to say. For example, he
doesn't think Oscar De La Hoya is as good as many believe and says
it openly.
And he remains a tough guy who won't back down from a scrap in
spite of a heart attack in 1979. In the melee that followed the
Riddick Bowe-Andrew Golota fight in July of 1996, Duva was in the
middle of the fray and ended up in the hospital after slumping to
the canvas.
Still, Duva is a people person if there ever was one. He loves
people and they love him, a key to his success.
