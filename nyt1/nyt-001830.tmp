In some games, only one player can hold rights to a given
celebrity; others require a payoff upon each celebrity's passing,
rather than a once-a-year accounting. In many pools, the payoff is
far greater for choices with lower odds of mortality, which is what
so troubled trader Dave about Marvin Gaye.
But perhaps not until it got to Wall Street where betting is
like breathing did the ghoul pool find a permanent home.
In large law firms, ghoul lagoons are often gurgling in the back
of some paralegal's cubicle. A mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer at
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen Katz in New York City says his name would
be the next to surface in his firm's pool if such unjudicial
shenanigans were publicized.
Just as laptop computer technology has enabled day trading and
desktop publishing to flourish outside the office, so the Web
browser has brought ghoul pools to life for the average investor.
It is now possible to play such diverse and painfully tacky venues as the Lee Atwater Invitational Dead Pool, Not Your Mother's
Dead Pool, Dewey's Death Pool, Chalk Outlines and Dead Club, to
name but a handful.
The Atwater Invitational, named after the take-no-prisoners GOP
campaign strategist who died in 1991 at age 40 of brain cancer
(http://stiffs.com), was started that year by Zachariah Love, a
venue-booker in Los Angeles.
Love moved the game to the Web in 1996, where it now has almost
600 players paying an $11 entrance fee for a shot at the $1,500
annual prize.
Interest in Internet versions has grown to the point where some
pools are specializing in picking death days for one celebrity.
Several months ago, Michael Moore, a student at California State
University at Long Beach and the operator of Tregoire's 1998 Dead
Pool (www.flash.net/mmoore72/deadpool.htm) spun off a Sinatra-only
site. Lucas Trerice, 20, a student at University of Washington, won
by taking the midpoint of guesses.
To indicate how quickly attitudes have shifted on the subject of
death or of good taste when Ms. Rutherford first asked Yahoo,
the Web indexer, to list her site three years ago, executives said
the content wasn't appropriate. Today, Yahoo lists 18 ghoul pools,
including Ms. Rutherford's, which gets more than 1,000 hits a week.
And as for Dave, my disgruntled Amex floor trader, the first
lady of the American stage was in no hurry to accommodate him.
Helen Hayes took her final bow nine years later, with dignity, at
age 92.
