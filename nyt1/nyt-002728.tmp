In the race for the Republican Senate nomination to challenge
Sen. Barbara Boxer, Darrell Issa, a multimillionaire car alarm
manufacturer who spent about $10 million, lost to state Treasurer
Matt Fong, but only after a wave of harshly critical news accounts
raised questions about Issa's business record and tactics.
Rich candidates have lost spectacularly in the past, of course,
including the cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, who spent $14 million
in the 1989 Republican mayoral primary in New York City, and lost
to Rudolph Giuliani, who spent $2.5 million and won 67 percent of
the vote.
In California, former Rep. Michael Huffington, a Republican oil
heir, set the previous national record for individual spending here
four years ago, by pouring nearly $30 million of his family fortune
into a nearly successful campaign against Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
But Checchi's resounding defeat still set off ripples of shock,
precisely because Huffington, who was widely regarded as a
political and intellectual lightweight, came so close, and because
Checchi, an altogether more serious figure, spent about 30 percent
more in the primary alone than Huffington spent in his primary and
general election combined.
In general in recent years, polls have shown that most voters
are neutral-to-positive about candidates who finance their own
campaigns, while support for public campaign financing is often
tepid. But as this year's campaign wore on, voters here seemed
taken aback by the sheer reach of Checchi's record-breaking effort.
A poll in April by the Public Policy Institute of California
found that 6 in 10 voters were indifferent to a candidate's
decision to finance his own campaign, but by May, voters indicated
a marked preference, 52 percent to 34 percent, for candidates who
took the conventional route of collecting money from supporters.
In his final days on the campaign trail, Checchi went low-tech,
riding a yellow school bus around the state to highlight his
proposals for fixing the state's troubled schools, and publicly
lamenting that his rivals had outfoxed him by turning the race into
a debate about his money instead of his ideas.
The phrase appeared as far back as the early 1970s, uttered in
private conversations by Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in
reference to his country's hopes to go nuclear. In the atmosphere
of the time, it seemed a serious warning: that once one Islamic
nation had nuclear weapons, it would enhance the power of them all.
But is there such a thing as a bomb that exists for the sake of
Islam and for the destruction of Israel? Or do the phrase and the
oratory about it reveal other things instead a hunger and rivalry
for greatness by major Islamic countries, and the depth of Israel's
anxieties?
There is, today at least, no special reason to believe that
Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a nuclear arsenal will
provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic societies, or that
those other countries will find it easier to go nuclear themselves.
