By now the paradoxes of his life have entered literary
mythology. The mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, an Oxford
don, was reported to have been quite a dull lecturer. But when he
adopted a pseudonym, he created exuberant fantasies for children
that leave the chalk board and lecture hall far behind.
He was eminently respectable, a lifelong bachelor and a close
family friend of the college's dean; but he was also almost
obsessively infatuated with the dean's prepubescent daughters,
particularly Alice Liddell, who, at the age of 10, was the
inspiration for his Alice books. And while in his diaries there are
traces of the stern moralist grimly recording his struggles with
unspecified temptations, in his books he turned all moral lessons
on their heads.
Del Tredici treats this as a miniopera, exaggerating the scale,
so it becomes a scene like one witnessed by Alice in one of her
many changes in size. As a result, the poem's solemn piety is
dissolved into a kind of wistful amusement at something from
another universe. Carroll dissolved it even more completely:
This is sleight of hand of a very high order, mocking moral
convention while apparently just creating nonsense. Something is at
stake in this satire, something that may be connected to the
unhappiness his biographer, Morton Cohen, finds in Carroll's life.
It may have arisen, in part, from Carroll's inability or
unwillingness to reconcile the disruptive looking-glass world with
the tautly controlled order of his own.
Cohen points out one occasion when some kind of disturbing
fantasy may have even broken through the veneer. Something took
place during late June 1863, after Alice had already inspired
Wonderland, that led to a nearly complete break between Carroll and
the Liddells.
Was it some sort of inappropriate behavior involving Alice?
(Cohen suggests a premature marriage proposal.) Or was it something
far less respectable, (which Cohen does not think too plausible)?
We will never know: The journal page on which Carroll had recorded
his transgression was neatly excised by a niece who found the
revelation too shocking.
Carroll's heirs range from P.L. Travers, who created a
ruthlessly unsentimental Mary Poppins, to Maurice Sendak, whose
painterly images of dream worlds can be more unsettling to adults
than to children.
But Carroll also tamed the irrationality by giving his nonsense
logical form. The effect in our own era of fierce conventions can
be bracing. Forget the issues of being and seeming, of propriety
and guilt, of threats and recriminations. Carroll offers
alternative advice:
Skip Away, who developed a slight swelling in his legs over the
weekend, was reported to be much improved Sunday. But his trainer,
Sonny Hine, said he would wait until his star horse worked out
Tuesday before clearing him to travel to California to race Silver
Charm and Gentlemen next Sunday in the $1 million Hollywood Gold
Cup.
Hine said Skip Away's legs were apparently strained during an
exercise gallop Friday morning when he swerved to avoid a horse
that had fallen in the mud. Skip Away, the champion older horse
last year and champion 3-year-old in 1996, unseated his rider, Jose
Sanchez, and got loose for 20 minutes before he was brought back by
an outrider.
