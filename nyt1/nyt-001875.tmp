This fantasy all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds perhaps thousands dead.
Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
