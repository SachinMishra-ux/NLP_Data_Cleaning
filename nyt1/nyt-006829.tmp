It was a night of mixed emotions for the host nation. Yes, the
French have soothed some of the fears about their ability to score
and to entertain with seven goals in their first two matches. Yes,
their defensive instincts and organization remain arguably the
world's finest. But they are now running dangerously low on
center-forwards, and they will now have to do without their finest
player, Zidane, for at least one and possibly two games, and
Dugarry for at least two weeks.
What made Zidane's red card more remarkable was that it was the
fifth of the day. Three were awarded in the earlier Group C match
between Denmark and South Africa.
Two were awarded Thursday night: the first in the 19th minute to
Saudi defender Mohammed al-Jahani after an aggressive late tackle
on Bixente Lizarazu. Clearly, the referees are taking Sepp Blatter,
the new FIFA president, at his word.
Blatter has been trying to rub out dangerous tackling for years,
and reminded officials of his desires Wednesday. Since then, six
red cards have been issued in three matches.
Thursday night, it was 11 Frenchmen against 10 Saudis for much
of the match, and it probably would not have been much of a match
even on equal footing. The French were in control from the start,
and if they had been more decisive offensively, they could have
gotten more than two goals from Thierry Henry, one goal from David
Trezeguet and one from Lizarazu.
Parreira left the MetroStars to coach the Saudis for a large
fistful of petrodollars. But after two losses, his new team no
longer has any chance of repeating its surprising 1994 performance
of advancing to the second round, and that will not delight the
princes who run Saudi soccer and have a decidedly Steinbrenneresque
approach to hiring and firing.
WASHINGTON In what has become an annual ritual for the
Republicans in control of Congress, a House subcommittee voted
Thursday to kill the National Endowment for the Arts but the Senate
was expected to revive it.
There was little debate in the House on the reasons for axing
the $98 million in federal money for the arts agency next year.
Republicans on the subcommittee were generally silent as Democrats
branded them as sheep following their leaders' election-year
efforts to satisfy conservatives.
New York state, which receives about 23 percent of the
endowment's grants, is the largest beneficiary in the nation. The
endowment subsidizes the New York State Council of the Arts and
such landmark institutions as Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan
Opera.
The agency has been a favorite punching bag for conservatives,
who object to spending taxpayer dollars for the arts in the first
place and for artistic efforts that they deem obscene and profane.
But moderates and liberals, and many of their constituents, support
it and for the last three years they have overridden conservative
efforts to abolish it.
