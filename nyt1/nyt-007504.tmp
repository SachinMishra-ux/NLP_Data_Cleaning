The pass went long, well over Blanco, but Blanco dove feet-first
and whacked the ball with his left foot in front of De Wilde and,
well, then it was the raucous Mexican fans who went wild.
NEW YORK After tossing six shutout innings in Miami last
Sunday, Hideo Nomo said he could not remember his best performance
of the season. Suffice it to say, Nomo will surely be able to
recall better days than Saturday.
With 44,355 fans on hand at Shea Stadium for a souvenir bat
giveaway, Nomo could not find home plate. In his five-plus innings,
he not only walked six batters, but he also could not hold onto a
3-0 lead in a game he and the Mets would eventually lose, 8-3, to
the lowly Florida Marlins.
In case no one has noticed, the Mets are slumping. Badly.
Instead of energizing the almost-full house on Saturday, the Mets
let another game slip away to one of the worst teams in the
National League. In the last eight days, the Mets (38-31) have lost
six times to Florida and Montreal, including their last four in a
row.
By trading for Mike Piazza on May 22 and then for Nomo on June
4, the Mets were not only trying to shore up their roster for a
post-season run, but also trying to change a popular perception
that they were an adequate but boring team without any marquee
players.
But any team exciting or mundane that aspires to make it to
the playoffs simply cannot afford loss after loss to
salary-challenged teams like the Expos and the Marlins. If the Mets
keep it up, they may quickly chase away the fans they were hoping
to lure back to Shea.
In each of the six losses to the Expos and Marlins, the Mets
have had the lead sometimes late in the game, sometimes early,
sometimes in the fifth or sixth inning. In some of the losses the
problem has been a bullpen that has turned extremely shaky. In
others, it has been the normally stellar starting pitching that has
broken down. And in almost every instance, the Mets have been badly
served by an offense that just does not score many runs.
Nomo who has yet to win in three starts with the Mets was
almost down by 4-0 Saturday before the first inning was over. But
Wayne Kirby, who started in center field, reached up at the wall in
left-center and grabbed Derrek Lee's drive just as it was about to
become a grand slam. And then the Mets scored three times in the
third off Livan Hernandez, the first run driven in by Nomo on a
bases-loaded walk.
Florida Manager Jim Leyland was ejected from his perch in the
dugout one pitch later, having lobbed a few choice words toward the
home-plate umpire, Dana DeMuth. Edgardo Alfonzo, who had three
hits, followed with a two-run single to right to give Nomo a 3-0
lead.
But the Marlins roared right back to tie the game in the third
with a two-out rally, highlighted by Todd Zeile's two-run homer
that bounced off the top of the right-field fence. Nomo walked
three Marlins in the inning, including Craig Counsell with the
bases loaded, to give the Marlins a 3-3 tie.
