Disney's intention is to create a new Internet service that
combines Infoseek with its existing offerings, which include Web
sites for ABC television, ABC News, the ESPN sports network,
Disney's movies, and a site of original Disney entertainment for
children.
Disney, like many other media companies, has been talking to a
number of portal services over the last year. A few months ago, it
was close to buying a part of Excite, the No. 2 portal service, but
the deal fell apart over the price, investment bankers said.
With the stock of the search services trading at stratospheric
prices, big companies have been loath to buy them either with cash
or their own, more conventionally valued shares.
Disney's deal gets around this problem by trading some of its
own Internet ventures at the high value such companies carry for shares in Infoseek. Specifically, Disney will receive 43
percent of Infoseek in return for $70 million in cash and
relinquishing ownership of Starwave, a company that creates
elaborate Web sites.
Starwave's biggest venture is the sports site it operates on
behalf of ESPN. Disney bought Starwave in several phases over the
last year from Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft. Keith
Benjamin, an analyst for BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, estimated
that Disney paid about $400 million for Starwave and that it would
be worth about $800 million if it were an independent company.
Thursday's announcement represented something of an about-face
for Disney. When it bought full control of Starwave two months ago,
it announced plans to integrate the Seattle-based technology
company with its own Internet operations in Burbank, Calif. Now,
all of Starwave will become part of Infoseek, which has
headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., in Silicon Valley.
Disney also agreed to lend Infoseek up to $139 million over the
next five years in return for the option to bring its ownership to
50.1 percent. Disney, however, will get back most of the cash it is
spending, as Infoseek has agreed to buy $165 million in advertising
from Disney over the next three years. That money will buy both
television advertising on ABC and promotion at other Disney
operations, like the Internet pavilion at Disney World.
NBC's deal to buy a stake in Snap was much more favorable to the
shareholders of Cnet, the company that owned the portal, Benjamin
said. In particular, it will provide more than $100 million in free
television advertising.
NBC, however, has much more limited ambitions for Snap, a
service with well-regarded technology and very few users. The
television network hopes that heavy TV promotions will turn Snap
into a popular, stand-alone guide service. NBC's other Internet
activities, especially its MSNBC news service operated with
Microsoft, will remain separate from Snap.
Disney, by contrast, is looking to merge its properties into a
unified service that will have more of the cohesive feel that
America Online has.
