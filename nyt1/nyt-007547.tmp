U.S. News and World Report said on Saturday that one of its
editors had been allowed to listen to two hours of previously
undisclosed recordings of Ms. Lewinsky and that she was infatuated
with Clinton, although the tapes are ambiguous about whether there
was a physical relationship between the president and the former
White House intern.
The magazine said that an associate editor, Elise Ackerman, was
allowed to listen to the tapes, which were made last October, under
an agreement in which she was not allowed to make a copy, nor take
notes while she was listening.
According to the report, the tapes were among those made by
Linda Tripp, the former Pentagon employee who turned her tapes of
Ms. Lewinsky over to Starr, who is trying to determine if Clinton
or others sought to coerce Ms. Lewinsky into lying.
SAN FRANCISCO On one side of the equation is Payne Stewart,
the wire-to-wire leader at the U.S. Open whose four-stroke
advantage represents the largest third-round margin at the event
since 1970.
Problem is, Stewart is also playing at the Olympic Club, where
no third-round leader has gone on to win the Open in three previous
visits to the course.
Stewart, an SMU graduate who fashioned a third-round 70 to
remain the only player under par through three rounds (3 under),
said yesterday that he likes his chances to close out his
competitors for the championship.
Stewart showed few signs of backing up during the third round
yesterday, opening with an eagle and building his lead to four
strokes by the time he reached the sixth tee box. Stewart, who led
by a single stroke after each of the first two rounds, did not let
the cushion dip below four stokes the rest of the way.
He will carry that four-shot advantage into the final pairing
with Tom Lehman, who sat on the 54-hole lead at the past three
Opens but did not win any. Also trailing Stewart by four strokes is
Bob Tway (1 over), with Nick Price and Lee Janzen, both at 2 over,
the only other players within five strokes of the lead.
Members of that five-player group have combined to win eight
major championships, with each owning at least one major title and
only Price (three) having more than two. Suffice to say, it is a
far more elite list of pursuers that awaits Stewart today than the
cast of characters who dropped off the pace yesterday, when PGA
Tour journeymen Jeff Maggert (75) and Lee Porter (75) joined U.S.
Amateur champ Matt Kuchar (76) as fallen contenders.
Yet Stewart, winner of the 1991 Open and the 1989 PGA
Championship, insists that he is undaunted by the history of
Olympic, which has seen golfing giants Ben Hogan (1955), Arnold
Palmer (1966) and Tom Watson (1987) reeled in by less-heralded
players in come-from-behind fashion in the final round.
