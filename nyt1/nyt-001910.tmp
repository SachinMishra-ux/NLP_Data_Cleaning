To John G. Learned, a University of Hawaii physicist and member
of the research team, the results are virtually unprecedented and
an extraordinary contribution to science's fundamental insights
into the past and present of the universe.
That theory, a concept first proposed by Albert Einstein and
often reiterated by British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, seeks
to find a single set of equations that can explain all the
fundamental forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, and
the strong and weak interactive forces among subnuclear particles.
In that standard model, all those particles except the neutrinos
have mass, but now the model will have to be revised if the new
discovery is validated.
The Japanese experiment did not actually measure the mass of the
neutrinos it detected, but instead it enabled the experimenters to
calculate the tiny difference between the mass of neutrinos in each
state just as they oscillated to another state.
As Learned explained it, those oscillations altered each
neutrino known as a muon neutrino into a new and different state
called a tau neutrino. At most the actual mass of each of those
neutrino states was an almost infinitely small fraction of the
total mass of an entire electron, the lightest of the traditional
fundamental particles.
But at best, he said in an interview, only about 20 percent of
the entire mass of the universe is made up of neutrinos, while
barely 5 percent is the mass of ordinary matter we can see or touch
or feel or observe through telescopes. All the rest about 75
percent of the mass of the universe must be cold and dark and
wholly unknown so far, Silk said.
The rookie first baseman twice was called out on a strikes by
home plate umpire Jim Quick on Thursday night. Each time the third
strike appeared to be several inches off the plate.
To his credit, Lee said nothing, continuing to show far more
resolve and cool-headedness than most 23-year-olds could display.
Lee has got to be burning on the inside. Somehow, he refuses to
show it on the outside.
Which is exactly where one of baseball's most deep-seeded
problems lies. Players and staff cannot say anything disparaging
about an umpire for fear of suffering severe consequences.
Hitting coach Jim Presley finally did say something when a
seventh-inning pitch to Colorado's Greg Colbrunn was called a ball,
even though it was practically in the exact location where Lee was
rung up.
