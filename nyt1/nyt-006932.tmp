Worse, the Israeli army appears to be turning the temporary
territorial divisions that exist in the West Bank under the Oslo
agreement into permanent facts.
About 6,000 of the Palestinians who work on the farms in the
valley are seasonal laborers who live in villages near Nablus.
These are in Area B under Oslo's classification, meaning that they
come under Palestinian civilian jurisdiction.
The effect of these measures is the steady migration of
Palestinians westwards from the valley to urban areas such as East
Jerusalem and Nablus.
It is precisely this eventuality that Netanyahu is preparing
against. (To publish this 625-word article, it must be purchased the rate

JERICHO Whether or not the Israelis do what they are supposed
to do under the Oslo agreements, they continue to prepare for a
final settlement with the Palestinians.
Some 35,000 Palestinians live or work on the West Bank side of
the Jordan Valley. Covering an area of 700,000 dunums (175,000
hectares), the valley is one of the West Bank's most fertile
regions, containing 60 percent of the Palestinians' horticultural
land.
After the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the
Palestinians hoped they might be able to add to the developed area.
But the restrictions and confiscations continue.
Jawad Salah cites the case of an agricultural research station
in the valley, which helped farmers with crop research and
technology; Israel has refused to transfer the station to the
Palestinian Authority by declaring its 300 dunums to be one of
those closed security zones.
The Israelis have also, in the past three years, made security
zones of many of the hills in the Jordan Valley. These hills are
traditionally used as grazing pastures by Bedouin shepherds, who
are now being forced to abandon some of their goats and sheep.
Worse, the Israeli army appears to be turning the temporary
territorial divisions that exist in the West Bank under the Oslo
agreement into permanent facts.
