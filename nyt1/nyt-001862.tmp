The Milwaukee race was Shafer's first with MCI after signing on
with it earlier this spring as a part-time driver.
Tach it up: For 25 years, Lions Drag Strip roared on weekends
with sounds of souped up engines. Those who remember those days
fondly are holding a reunion this weekend at the Carson Community
Center, 3 Civic Plaza Drive, in Carson.
A variety of vintage cars and other memorabilia from the strip,
which closed in 1972, will be displayed. Also on hand will be NHRA
funny car driver Gary Densham.
End of the string: Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke couldn't overcome a
poor starting position and finished sixth at Saturday's NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Tour Colorado 125. His winning streak thus
was stopped at two.
Baja-bound: More than 200 off-road racers are expected in
Ensenada, Mexico, this weekend to run the SCORE Baja 500 Desert
Race. One of the marquee events of the SCORE season, the race draws
the top names in off-road racing, including nine-time overall
champion Ivan Stewart.
Drivers will run in 23 classes, 16 for cars and trucks, seven
for motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles.
Mighty midgets: Simi Valley's Rick Hendrix won a 30-lap showdown
at Tucson Raceway Park last weekend and continues to lead the USAC
Western States Midget standings. Simi Valley neighbor Alex Harris
continued his domination of the three-quarter midget ranks, winning
at Perris Auto Speedway.
Nuts and bolts: In just three years, Italy's Alex Zanardi has
become the dominant figure in CART racing. In 38 starts he has 10
poles and 10 victories. In his past 13 races, he has been in the
top three 11 times.... The IRL will run twice at Texas Motor
Speedway this year. The two events, Saturday night's True Value 500
and Sept. 20's Longhorn 500, have been dubbed the Texas Two-Step
Championship with an extra $100,000 going to the driver with the
most combined points.
TAKAYAMA, Japan In what colleagues hailed as a historic
landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and
the United States announced on Friday that they had found the
existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle
called the neutrino.
The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so
light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all.
After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the
possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the form of
neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a
highly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the
Standard Model.
