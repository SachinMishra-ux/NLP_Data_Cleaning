Nonetheless, Ms. Bryant and other women on the Pittsburgh force
say the skills women bring to the job add vital components to
policing. Women, they say, are more inclined than men to use
communication skills to quell potentially violent situations, and
they can bring an extra sensitivity to situations involving
children and rape victims.
But for all the progress women have made on the Pittsburgh
force, many fear a backslide. A 1976 court order demanding that for
every white man hired, the force had to hire a woman and two
members of minorities, one a man and one a woman, expired in 1991.
Ever since, the number of women and members of minorities joining
the force has slowed. And in a recent lawsuit against the city,
eight white men who failed to get jobs on the force, won
settlements in a reverse discrimination case.
Officials here say the main impediment to recruiting highly
qualified women and men is the strong national economy, which
is enabling private industry to offer higher pay for entry-level
positions to people who would be attracted to a career in law
enforcement. In addition, municipal budget constraints, as
elsewhere, have slowed hiring. McNeilly said he did not expect the
city to replace officers who retired or resigned for more than a
year.
McNeilly and Mayor Tom Murphy said they remained sensitive to
the issue and they vowed to take new approaches to find qualified
women for the force. They said they intended to step up their
recruiting efforts and to focus on women leaving the military as a
likely pool of candidates.
For the time being, at least, Pittsburgh remains a showcase for
women in policing. The survey found that only five other cities Detroit, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington and Toledo, Ohio had
police forces in which women accounted for 20 percent of officers.
In all those cities but Miami, the strong presence of women was
aided by a court order, the survey found. On Miami's force of 2,920
officers, no woman serves in a command position.
By contrast, the survey found that 42 agencies including the
police departments in Nassau County, N.Y., and Newark, N.J., the
state police in New York and New Jersey, and the Port Authority of
New York-New Jersey had fewer than 10 percent female officers in
1997.
As she rose in rank over the years, she said, attitudes slowly
changed as men on the force grew more comfortable with women
because of the skills women brought to the job.
In many situations, Ms. Bryant said, women serve as a soothing
balance to the macho tendencies of male officers, a situation that
is influencing men on the force.
Ms. Bryant, who grew up in a housing project and saw police
officers as people to be feared, conceded that old ways die hard
among some officers. But most men working under her command, she
said, dare not display any signs of discomfort or disrespect.
But the surest sign of progress, she said, may be the blackboard
in the men's room, on which officers scribble complaints and nasty
remarks or so she is told.
