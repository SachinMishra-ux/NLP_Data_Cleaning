Karros struck out on a 1-2 off-speed pitch, leaving the game to
Mondesi, who still is a little hobbled by the left ankle he
sprained in San Diego.
Jones, seeking to become the first woman in 50 years to win the
100, 200 and long jump in the USA Track and Field Championships,
can complete the triple with a triumph today in the 200 meters.
Jones took a big step toward the historic triple Saturday night
at Tad Gormley Stadium, winning the 100 meters in 10.72 seconds and
the long jump with a wind-aided 23 feet, 8 inches. The nine-time
state champion from Thousand Oaks High also won her 200 semifinal
in 22.46 seconds for the top qualifying mark for the final.
So is John Godina, who became the first man to win the shot put
and discus in 43 years despite competing with torn cartilage in his
right shoulder. Godina, who won the discus late Friday night for
his second consecutive national title, was never challenged in his
quest for his first national shot-put title.
Godina, the two-time world shot-put champion, won with a put of
71-2}. The former UCLA standout's six efforts were 68-10 or better
to outdistance runner-up C.J. Hunter (68-4).
Jones started her journey toward the historic triple with a
victory in the 100. Jones got off to a slow start, but her mark was
only a hundredth off her world-leading 10.71 that she ran in Friday
night's semifinals.
Saturday's mark of 10.72 ranks as the seventh-fastest, trailing
only four marks by Florence Griffith-Joyner, the world record
holder at 10.49, and Jones' two times of 10.71 run this season.
In Saturday's 100 final, Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines had the
edge on Jones out of the blocks. Jones, however, assumed command by
the 30-meter mark en route to a comfortable victory. Gaines was
second in 10.89 to become the ninth-fastest American. Miller,
hampered by tendinitis in her knee, was third in 11.12 and Torri
Edwards of USC was fourth in 11.20.
Jones took only two of her six attempts in the long jump,
posting her winning leap of 23-8 on her first jump and fouling on
the second before heading off to run in the 200 semifinals. Jones,
the world-leader at 23-11}, still won by more than a foot over
Shana Williams and Dawn Burrell, who were second and third with
identical marks of 22-7.
Heat and humidity took its toll on 1997 world champion Maurice
Greene and Dennis Mitchell, who scratched from the 100 because of
cramps.
