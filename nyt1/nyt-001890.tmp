The hourlong eulogy Thursday in a stone cemetery chapel at
Forest Lawn Memorial Park in suburban Glendale drew more than 20
family members and their spouses, as news helicopters hovered above
and reporters stood outside the cemetery gates.
A few paparazzi tried to storm the hilltop Church of the
Recessional but were turned back by security personnel, said family
spokesman Stan Rosenfield.
Hartman and his wife have been cremated, in accordance with
their wills, which directed that the 49-year-old comic's ashes be
scattered at Emerald Bay off Catalina Island, Rosenfield said.
Rosenfield said he hopes that by Monday he will announce the
charities that relatives have selected to receive donations on
behalf of the Hartmans.
On Wednesday night, celebrities and friends of Phil Hartman
attended a memorial service at The Groundlings, the Melrose Avenue
improv company that Hartman belonged to from 1975 to 1986.
Earlier this week, Los Angeles police released a tape of the 911
call that led them to the couple's home in suburban Encino on May
28. The caller, Ron Douglas of nearby Studio City, told dispatchers
that Brynn Hartman, a longtime friend, had come to his home
sometime after 3 a.m. and confessed to shooting her husband.
Initially disbelieving her, Douglas followed her back to the
Hartmans' home, where he saw Phil Hartman's body and called police.
Douglas was taking one of the couple's children from the house when
Brynn Hartman, 40, locked herself in the master bedroom and shot
herself.
According to police, she did not tell Douglas why she killed her
husband.
Friends of the Hartmans said the marriage was troubled by both
the comedian's inability to communicate with his wife and her bouts
with drugs and alcohol.
Police found no illegal drugs in the house after the
murder-suicide, but coroner's investigators plan to do further
toxicological tests, the results of which will not be available for
at least a week.
