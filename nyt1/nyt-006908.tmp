After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
Outright depression in Japan, further rounds of economic and
political turmoil in the rest of Asia, and a global slump to
follow: might this dismal scenario unfold after all?
On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must and can act decisively to revive its
economy.
It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
