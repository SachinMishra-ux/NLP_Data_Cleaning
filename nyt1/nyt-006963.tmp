mind. By GARY MARTIN

LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) One of the darkest fears I hear
expressed by the 50 or so people who call me every day is that the
poor are ripping them off. I can understand resentment against
able-bodied adults who are on the dole. Especially when those
able-bodied adults happen to be collecting aid while they're behind
bars. By DAN LYNCH.
Since then, the list has been the source of much discussion and
consternation. What made it is moot. It's what didn't that irks us
most.
That's the problem with a list like this: Everyone who's ever
gone to the movies has a really loud opinion. The AFI determined
its winners from a tally of 1,500 voters (including filmmakers,
critics, historians and assorted bigwigs), who chose their top 100
choices from a ballot of 400 domestic feature films.
Orson Welles' masterwork is a movie everyone can agree on. It's
groundbreaking cinema, artful, poetic and thrillingly smart. No one
participating in the AFI vote would have dared leave it off their
list; it's too important, already too widely regarded as the
greatest movie ever made.
Naming the best 100 movies is a pointless task, because a good
film spurs intense emotional response. It inspires passion, anger,
terror, anxiety, laughter, grief or delight. Despite all the talk
of lighting and camera angles and well-crafted scripts, the act of
moviegoing is a profoundly subjective experience. Movies are our
secret worlds; when we enter, we give ourselves up to fantasy. The
films that hold us firmly are those that win our hearts.
