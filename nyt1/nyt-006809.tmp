Ms. Smith also acknowledged making up Jim Burke, a worker
erecting barricades at the marathon, in her column of April 20th;
and Claire, for whom Ms. Smith did not give a last name, the
subject of an entire poignant column about a woman with cancer,
published on May 11.
Ms. Smith, who began her newspaper career as a typist at the
Chicago Daily News, joined the Globe in 1990. She has been writing
a column for the Metro/Region section since 1994. Earlier this
year, she won an award from the American Society of Newspaper
Editors for a series of her columns published in 1997. She was also
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. A poet,
she has been widely recognized in the Boston arts community for her
public readings.
The Globe said Ms. Smith admitted the fabrications after being
questioned by Moore. Storin said the Globe initially had questions
about six columns and that Ms. Smith admitted to fabrications in
four of them.
In a noontime meeting Thursday, Storin and Taylor told the news
staff of their request for Ms. Smith's resignation.
TOKYO The South Korean government officially decreed 55
troubled companies nonviable Thursday, signaling their likely
demise in hopes of accelerating the revamping of the economy and
ailing financial system.
To some critics, the list also closely resembled the
heavy-handed tactics used by governments past to guide the economy.
Those tactics are also blamed for creating the mountain of debt and
system of crony capitalism that has contributed to South Korea's
problems.
The list was compiled with the assistance of South Korea's
debt-laden banks after a review of 313 troubled companies. It is
aimed at restoring health to the financial system and accelerating
the reorganization in the country's heavily leveraged corporate
sector, which has been slow to pursue change.
The list includes 20 companies that are part of the country's
five largest chaebol Samsung group, LG group, Hyundai group,
Daewoo group and SK group. The commission sent an earlier list back
to the banks because it did not include chaebol subsidiaries.
But only one of the Big Five affiliates on the list Hyundai
Livart Co., a furniture manufacturer is listed on the Korean
stock exchange. The ax will fall largely on small, virtually
unknown subsidiaries.
Lee of the supervisory commission said companies on the list had
little chance of survival because banks and affiliates cannot lend
them money. However, the companies can sell off most of their
assets to survive or can seek merger partners. They also can seek
bankruptcy court protection, although banks are highly unlikely to
agree to such conditions.
