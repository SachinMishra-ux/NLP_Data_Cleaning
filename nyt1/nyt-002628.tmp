It would be necessary to know, among other points, whether
Jackson would want to be involved in rebuilding the Bulls, perhaps
the oldest team in the league. Jackson has suggested he would not.
But like the ghost of Banquo, the notion hovers that in a matter
of a fortnight, Jordan will be gone forever from the hardwood
scene, depriving a city, a nation and large pockets of the rest of
the earth, the moon and the stars the pleasure of his basketball
genius. It is a genius still wondrous, though, older and achier, he
is no longer first in flight.
But if Jordan is relying on the Jackson outcome, then it seems
safe to say that the decision is Jackson's, because it is
Reinsdorf's.
MEXICO CITY Alejandra Barrales Magdaleno's views about unions
and labor were forged while she was flying into U.S. cities as a
$700-a-month Aeromexico flight attendant, often alongside those
from U.S. airlines whose salaries were four times as high.
Now as the leader of Mexico's 2,000-member flight attendants
union, Ms. Barrales symbolizes the more independent and vigorous
labor movement emerging here a year after the death of Fidel
Velazquez, the union czar who kept workers submissive for decades.
With Mexico's economy strengthening after years of crisis, Ms.
Barrales brought to a modestly successful conclusion on Saturday
evening the first nationwide strike by one of the politically
independent unions that formed a new federation last year. These
unions are an important element in Mexico's democratic transition.
The contrast could hardly be more dramatic between Velazquez,
who was anti-communist, anti-American and when he died last year
at the age of 97 antediluvian, and Ms. Barrales, who is 30 years
old, politically independent, and an admirer of the U.S., Canadian
and European labor movements.
There are now fewer strikes in Mexico because so many have been
crushed. In fact, the government helped management during the
flight attendants' strike by seizing control of the airline to keep
planes flying.
But during a week of picketing and negotiations, Ms. Barrales
marshaled middle-class support and focused international pressure
on management, finally wringing modest salary increases and new
benefits from the airline.
Despite Mexican workers' reputation for being among the world's
most long-suffering, the outcome suggests that after nearly two
decades of falling wages, some at least want to lodge more
aggressive demands.
