Sometime in the morning or early afternoon, Laudor had also
spoken by telephone to his mother, who lives in New Rochelle.
Something in the conversation apparently disturbed Mrs. Laudor
because at about 4:20 p.m., in what the police described as a
distraught voice, she called the Hastings police station to let
them know of her conversation with her son.
Police found the body and decided to go directly to the mother's
New Rochelle home to inform her. Schiavone said that it was clear
to the mother that it was her son who had killed Ms. Costello.
Thursday afternoon, Ms. Costello's parents, William and Marilyn,
flew in from Newton, Mass., where she grew up, to identify her body
and talk to investigators.
It was after college while working for a management consultant
firm that he experienced his first brush with illness. He
complained that his phones were tapped. Later, he began to hear
bells in the night and to imagine that his room was in flames.
Randy Banner, a journalist who is a friend of the Laudor family,
said that Michael's father would talk him down from his
hallucinations, asking him, for example, to place his hands in the
flame that he imagined.
His father helped him through Yale Law School, where he
performed so brilliantly he was awarded a postdoctoral
associateship. He also saw himself as a role model for the mentally
ill, and in the Times interview expressed his displeasure with what
he said were stereotypes of schizophrenics as violent.
You see the reaction again and again when driving Volvo's new
C70 coupe. When you double-park at the dry cleaners, pull into a
parking garage, approach a toll booth, people glance quickly, then
do a double-take. They are puzzled.
Instinctively, they know the C70 is a Volvo; the rectangular
grille with its diagonal slash mark could belong to nothing else.
But the lines are sleek and clean, so the C70 genuinely looks like
a car and not, as Volvos have for ages, like the box the car came
in.
And then they have me stumped. For while the C70 is eye-catching
and elegant and its turbo-charged engine serves up some serious
fun, it is not particularly enjoyable to drive. It lacks the sharp
reflexes of a BMW 328is, the rock-of-ages rigidity of a Mercedes
CLK320 or the fist-in-a-velvet-glove control of the Lexus SC 300.
The Volvo's combination of high power and front-wheel drive
results as is often the case in twitchy road manners unbecoming
a serious driver's car. And with aggressive, low-profile tires on
big 18-inch wheels, the test car's rough-and-tumble ride did not
measure up to luxury-car standards.
