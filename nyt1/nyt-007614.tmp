Rising costs are sometimes cited as justification for the price
increases. The Boston Red Sox, in announcing a ticket price
increase at Fenway Park, argued that the money would go in part to
pay the salaries of expensive baseball players. Procter Gamble
invoked higher paper costs as the reason for a 6 percent increase
in the prices of bath and facial tissues in January. And Burger
King blamed the rising minimum wage, which has pushed up the
earnings of many of its employees, as a reason for cutting back
sharply on the discounting of its Whopper hamburger.
Still, there is the problem of getting customers in the door.
Americans have grown accustomed to discounts and bargains, and
Burger King still offers 99-cent specials. But now it generally
features less costly food than the Whopper a small milkshake, for
example, or onion rings or fries. The hope is that once in the
door, customers will spring for the Whopper.
That same sort of ceiling seemed to govern an increase in pay
phone rates in many states. Deregulation permitted the increase,
but an attempt by local phone companies, which own many of the pay
phones, to impose a 50-cent minimum in some Midwestern states
resulted in a sharp decline in use. The customer resistance
disappeared at a 35-cent minimum, and that became the norm in many
states starting last October, although not in New York, which still
charges 25 cents.
WASHINGTON Hunkered down over pepperoni pizza and diet cola, a
House task force on healthcare labored recently over one of the
most contentious election year issues: whether to impose federal
regulation on the nation's managed care companies.
And the driving force making managed care into a front burner
issue, sat, some might even say as the unwanted dinner guest, at
the mahogany table in the back room of House Majority Whip Dennis
Hastert's Capitol office.
Norwood rode to Congress in 1994 in large part on the coattails
of the conservative agenda espoused by fellow Georgian, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, as well as support from the business
community. But over the last six months, Norwood has raised the ire
of both his conservative brethren and major business groups in his
quest to overhaul the way managed care is administered.
Over the last year, Norwood has been drumming up support for his
bill, commonly called the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act
(PARCA).
Simply put, the bill would regulate the managed care industry,
which provides health care to more than 160 million Americans by
creating several consumer protections. For example, the bill would
give patients a way to appeal decisions made by their plans and
most importantly, it would allow patients to sue their health plans
for damages.
So for the last four months, the task force has been working
with Norwood at breakfast meetings and lunches to draft a bill that
seeks seeks to improve patient rights with managed care companies
without angering the business community.
Business groups are lobbying heavily against Norwood's bill and
there is a general sense that their efforts have paid off and that
the bill that will emerge from the task force will be far different
from what Norwood advocated.
