The man who embraces death is against the death penalty. Baden
said his opposition to capital punishment is not rooted in
philosophical or theological reasoning, but rather the fact that
authorities sometimes arrest the wrong person.
Baden, who has courted the news media throughout his career, is
colorful and upfront with his responses (too upfront for some
colleagues).
Pless, who is also a professor at the Indiana University School
of Medicine, said that despite concerns of some, he doesn't buy the
notion that Baden is a hired gun willing to testify to anything to
suit a client.
For the most part, death has treated Baden well. He is famous
and paid handsomely, an outsider who has been on the inside of
high-profile cases coast to coast. To him, death and demise are not
synonymous.

Q. I am 38, and my current investments include a 401(k) plan of
$30,269, almost evenly divided between Vanguard Index 500 and PIMCo
Stocks Plus funds, to which I have been adding $5,000 a year and
which is fully matched by my employer. I also have been investing
$2,400 a year in American Century Value fund, where the current
balance is $12,433, and $600 a year in Putnam New Opportunities
fund, where the balance is $5,552. Finally, I have a $12,718 IRA to
which I am no longer contributing in American Century Value. I
would like to leave my current job at the beginning of the year
2001 to work at a lower-paying, less stressful company or perhaps
to begin a career in a new field. In that case, I probably would
cut my investments to a rate of $2,000 a year. How do you suggest I
maximize my investments over the next few years, and how should I
invest the additional $2,000 a year I would be saving until
retirement? I realize if I stay with my current employer until
retirement I stand to gain financially, but I am just as interested
in living a life that is rich in personal fulfillment.
A. Yes, money isn't everything. And since you've made a solid
start on retirement savings at a fairly young age, you should end
up with a pretty substantial nest egg at age 65.
Presuming average 10 percent annual portfolio returns in all
these calculations, if you continue saving at the current rate for
the next 30 months you would have accumulated $114,470 by the time
of your contemplated career change. If you then slowed down to
$2,000 annual contributions for the next 24 1/2 years, the pool
would be $1,379,410 at age 65.
The problem with those tidy calculations is inflation, an
unknown of massive importance. Over the course of 27 years,
inflation can take an awful bite out of the buying power of a nest
egg.
You might begin by examining what kind of income stream
$1,379,410 might produce. If it were invested to yield an average
6.5 percent, it would bring in $89,661 a year, which at first seems
a tidy sum. But if inflation runs at 4 percent during those 27
years, that $89,661 comes to $31,095 in today's money; if inflation
is only 3 percent, that would give you $40,364 a year in current
buying power.
