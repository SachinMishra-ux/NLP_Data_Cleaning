On Saturday, caseworkers for the four groups used a two-page
questionnaire to screen hundreds of mothers, who were either
temporarily disabled or permanently disabled women who had been
denied federal disability benefits.
Those with serious disabilities were given an appointment for a
more complete evaluation, which will be reviewed by the State
Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals With
Disabilities. Most of those women will ultimately work 20 hours a
week for three months, and 35 hours a week after that, while
receiving career counseling, job search training and other
services. Twenty other New York counties, including Westchester and
Onondaga, also received state financing for similar programs.
Those welfare recipients who are determined to lack serious
disabilities will be re-examined by city doctors and may eventually
end up in the traditional workfare program, although they can
appeal that decision, city officials said. And those with the most
severe medical problems will be told to apply for federal
disability benefits.
No one knows how smoothly the new process will work. Advocates
for the poor in Wisconsin, which has also eliminated broad work
exemptions for the disabled, said they have not encountered
widespread problems. Jason Turner, the recently appointed chief of
New York City's welfare agency, was the architect of that state's
welfare program.
But the sheer size of New York City's welfare population makes
the job infinitely more complex. Wisconsin has only about 9,000
adults on public assistance statewide, while New York City has
about 200,000 mothers on welfare, including the 33,000 disabled
women.
Hundreds of those women filled the waiting rooms of the city's
welfare offices on Saturday, sitting on hard, plastic chairs as
they thumbed through plastic bags and time-worn envelopes for their
medical records. Most seemed stunned to learn that they were going
to work after city doctors had told them that they could not.
Excuse David Cone if, deep down, he never saw the humor in his
recent run-in with an impish Jack Russell terrier with a serious
overbite.
Confidence, not comedy, is what counts, especially at this point
in the career of a veteran pitcher.
When you're 35, with more great years behind you than ahead of
you, even a 7-1 record doesn't always bring peace. Losing a
starting assignment because of a freak injury certainly doesn't,
not when every tweak and tinge increasingly serves as a reminder of
one's mortality.
So don't assume that the bite that took a chunk out of Cone's
index finger and out of the Yankees' rotation, and cost Cone a
start last Tuesday, was in any way humorous to him. Not when his
reality includes mandatory pitch counts and salary incentives tied
to innings totals that are no longer sure things.
