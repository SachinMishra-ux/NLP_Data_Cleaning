That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
The baldness-causing agent? That's secret, of course. Generally,
I can tell you it's synthesized to mimic pheromones found in the
blood of veterans of President Clinton's damage-control team. Now
you can have the luxurious shimmer of James Carville without his
blood pressure.
In salve or pill, Nogaine can give you MJ's shine, if not his
jump shot. Hey, you take what you can get.
We're coming to understand that this hair stuff is an impediment
to excellence, all those wasteful spins on the salon chair, all
those creams and combs. With Nogaine, fuss no more.
The Chicago Bulls' championship was a symbolic victory by the
forces of baldness over those of baldness remedies. Utah's Karl
Malone has been a TV spokesman for Rogaine. Loser.
Now I'm thinking that getting rid of unneeded hair may only be
the first big-money pharmaceutical opportunity brought on by modern
social developments.
That's why, with women already starting to recoil from
scientific advances in the name of Viagra, my lab teams are busy
working on a pill to restore male impotence.
Texas Baptists Committed is a Baptist moderates support group
that during the last decade has fended off efforts of conservatives
to take over the Texas convention in the way they've done at the
national level.
But while conservatives are in full control of the
Nashville-based Southern Baptist Convention, moderates, led by
Baylor University's moderates, control the independently governed
Baptist General Convention of Texas.
While continuing to support Southern Baptist missionaries and
many other efforts of the national denomination, Texas Baptists now
send a smaller percentage of state money to the national
denomination and are backing moderate-led seminaries and university
theological training as an alternative to conservative graduate
theological training.
