Ten days after the broadcast, CNN's own military analyst, a
retired major general with a Ph.D. in international relations from
Columbia University, resigned in protest, calling the report false
and noting he was not consulted during its preparation.
CNN's own producers created some of the suspicion, by choosing
not to reveal a noteworthy fact about one of their most important
sources.
The accusation that sarin, a nerve gas banned by international
law, was used during Operation Tailwind, code-named for the secret
forays in Laos, is made most vigorously in the CNN report by two
soldiers who were there for one operation in 1970, Michael Hagen
and Robert Van Buskirk. But Van Buskirk told April Oliver, CNN's
main producer on this report, that he had repressed all memory of
that day's events for 24 years, from 1974, when he had a religious
awakening, until Ms. Oliver began questioning him.
Yet Ms. Oliver, who began work on the report last September, and
Jack Smith, a veteran CNN producer who joined her on the project in
February, decided to exclude mention of Van Buskirk's
recovered-memory revelation from their report. Nor did it appear in
the Time magazine article, co-authored by Ms. Oliver and Peter
Arnett, the CNN correspondent on the televised report.
John Stacks, an executive editor at Time who works on the
Newsstand collaboration, said he had known about Van Buskirk's
repressed memories of the foray, which included an incident in the
Laotian village where Van Buskirk said he chased a blond American
defector and presumably killed him by throwing a grenade into a
hole into which the man had fled.
Stacks said he had read CNN's background briefing book, which
contained transcripts of interviews, memos about off-camera
interviews, and scientific research about nerve gas, and was
confident of the report's accuracy. He also noted that Van Buskirk
was not CNN's only source.
Two other soldiers from Operation Tailwind who appeared in the
CNN report, Jim Cathy and Jay Graves, said they believed nerve gas
had been dropped. The retired admiral who was then chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Thomas Moorer, now 86 years old, also
appears on camera but his comments are ambiguous; Arnett's
narration says that Moorer admitted off-camera that nerve gas had
been used.
Haworth also said that Tom Johnson, president of CNN, and
Richard Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., were unavailable for
comment.
Three military experts told The New York Times that the use of
nerve gas in the Laotian foray described in the CNN report would
have been impossible: Thomas Stump, a former Air Force pilot who
flew two rescue missions for the unit that included Van Buskirk and
Hagen; Richard Shultz, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy at Tufts University who has spent the last three
years writing a history of the secret operations in Southeast Asia
during the war, and Maj. Gen. Smith.
They said that extremely potent forms of tear gas can cause the
symptoms described by the Tailwind veterans in CNN's report vomiting, loss of bowel control, falling to the ground and that
such gases were often used in rescue missions such as the one Stump
flew the day Hagen, Van Buskirk, Cathy, Graves and McCarley were
rescued in Laos.
