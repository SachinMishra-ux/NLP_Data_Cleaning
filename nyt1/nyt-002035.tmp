The situation in Kosovo is complex. Where in the Balkans isn't
it? But it is almost possible to sympathize with the thuggish
Milosevic.
Were he to yield to the Kosovo liberation movement, which seeks
independence as a step toward absorption by neighboring Albania, or
even grant autonomy to the province, he might as well pack his
suitcase and flee the country. He would trigger a national uprising
with many of his supposedly pro-democracy critics at home loudest
in their denunciation of him.
Milosevic could abandon the Bosnian Serbs as he did when he
signed the Dayton, Ohio, peace accord in November 1995 because his
own Serbs had turned sour on the Bosnian conflict following the
imposition of international economic sanctions against them. But
there's no sign of them buckling under to sanctions over Kosovo.
It's true that under the communist regime of the late Josef Broz
Tito, Kosovo possessed autonomy of sorts. But Tito had nothing to
fear. He ruled all Yugoslavia with unquestioned authority, and the
Kosovo separatists knew they didn't stand a chance of gaining
independence. An uprising in the Tito era would have been
unanimously condemned by the international community as increasing
the risk of a broader war.
Today, Milosevic rules a rump Yugoslavia consisting only of
Serbia and tiny Montenegro. In recent elections, even the
Montenegrins challenged his power.
So it's no wonder the Serbs view the Albanians' defiance and the
outside world's support for the rebels as tantamount to an attempt
to atomize Serbia itself.
Short of armed intervention by the United States and other
powers, it is hard to envisage the Serbs ever giving in. And, of
course, military intervention is unthinkable. Serbia is a sovereign
state of which Kosovo forms a part. Western indignation can produce
little practical result.
There is an irony in the crisis that is seldom mentioned: The
Albanians of Kosovo insist they want much closer ties with their
ethnic brothers and sisters of Albania.
But thousands of Albania's own citizens have fled to the West in
recent years, fed up with desperately impoverished living
conditions. Closer relations with fellow ethnics is just about the
last thing on the Albanian refugees' minds.
The incident occurred several years ago after a speech I made to
a women's organization in Ridgewood. I had just recalled an evening
toward the end of the acrimonious 1964 political showdown when
Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential nominee, took a
respite from campaigning to present his delightful collection of
Hopi Kachina dolls to a museum in Phoenix.
