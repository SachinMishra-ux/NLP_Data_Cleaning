Q: I do a great deal of PowerPoint presentations and I have to
use an overhead projector. A few years back I purchased a PC-to-TV
converter. The problem with this was that it would only handle the
lowest-resolution graphics available. Do you know of any way I can
use my PC and a TV as a monitor that will display the high level of
graphics that PowerPoint needs to be effective?
A: There are several graphics cards available now that feature
what's called TV-out. They will connect to either a monitor or a
TV, and the TV function is designed specifically for presentations.
Canada-based ATI Technologies is the most prolific manufacturer
of these kinds of cards. At the high end is its All-in-Wonder and
All-in-Wonder Pro, two video boards that include 2-D and 3-D
graphics acceleration with a TV tuner and TV-out capabilities. They
start at about $170 and go up to $350, depending on the model and
the amount of memory installed.
ATI also makes a low-end product, the 3D Xpression, with
PC-to-TV capabilities, that sells for about $120.
STB Systems of Richardson also makes a TV-out version of its
popular Velocity 128 2-D/3-D accelerator. It sells for about $150.
Finally, if you're interested in notebook computers with TV-out
capability, take a look at Compaq Computer Corp.'s Armada 4200
series.
Be sure when you're shopping for any kind of PC-to-TV device
that you get one compatible with the television standards for the
countries you travel to. In the United States, for example, you'll
want one that's NTSC-compatible.
A: BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System, and it controls
the ground-level functions of a personal computer. For example,
when your PC boots up, it's the BIOS that begins the process that
pulls in the operating system.
The BIOS controls such basic things as screen display, the
keyboard, drives and serial ports. Other system components, both
hardware and software, work with the BIOS to improve the function
of these essential parts.
You can change some of the functions of your BIOS. Check the
manual that came with your computer to see how to enter the BIOS
setup screen. In most cases, you'll need to hit a key just as your
system starts the boot process. On computers that use American
Megatrends BIOSes, for example, you hit the DEL key.
