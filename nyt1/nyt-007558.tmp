His father had been largely indifferent to his sporting
pursuits. His disinterest was a sore on my father's childhood that
festered and left him scarred well into adulthood. He vowed early
on his children would grow up knowing unequivocally that he cared.
So in the fall of 1972, when I announced swimming looked like a
lot of fun after watching Mark Spitz race to seven gold medals at
the Munich Olympics, my father moved almost as swiftly as Spitz
had.
Little did he know, as he set out the next day for the Santa
Clara Swim Club, the life he was about to enrich (other than his
child's) was his own.
The truth was, I was laughably short and scrawny. But I had my
father's drive and both my parents' unflagging support and in
the first year I went from being a novice to a member of an
age-group relay team that was ranked No. 1 in the country.
I would swim competitively for 11 more years and I can count on
one hand the number of swim meets my father missed until I moved
away to college. Win or lose, he was always there for me at the end
of the race, with a big hug (and, on occasion, a handkerchief to
wipe away the tears).
My pursuit of excellence would cost my father hundreds of
Saturday golf games, countless fishing trips and one job promotion
(it entailed a move across the country that my father feared would
disrupt my progress in the pool).
But what he gained was priceless: A bond with his daughter
that's the envy of all his golf-playing, pleasure-seeking,
corporate ladder-climbing cronies.
Our relationship is the envy of my friends, too, many of whom
grew up with fathers who stayed well in the periphery of their
daily lives (indeed, there were many high school meets where mine
was the only father in the seats). Once they got over being
intimidated by the mere sight and sound of my father, my friends
soaked up his attention like dry skin does lotion.
I, of course, basked in my father's company. Of all the things
we did together, I enjoyed our car rides the most. We spent hours
in the automobile, driving to and from swimming pools all over the
state.
We passed the time talking about everything under the sun. No
subject was too trivial or terrible to broach. Our rapport was such
that I trusted my father's judgment explicitly.
