In 1994 Panjaitan was ordered by a U.S. District Court judge in
Boston to pay $14 million in damages to the mother of a 20-year-old
New Zealand man who was among those killed. The suit was filed in
Boston by human rights activists after Panjaitan moved there for
studies at Boston University.
The general, who was removed from his military post after the
massacre, never appeared in court to answer the charges and
returned home to Indonesia in 1992 to join the staff of Habibie,
who was then technology minister.
Habibie, the former vice president, became president after the
resignation of President Suharto, who was forced from power in a
popular uprising against his 32 years of often brutal authoritarian
rule in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation.
Since taking over this spring, Habibie has promised a crackdown
on human-rights abuses by the Indonesian military and has hinted
that he may be willing to grant some degree of autonomy to East
Timor. Last week he freed 12 political prisoners associated with
the independence movement on East Timor.
The Boston lawsuit against the general was brought on behalf of
the mother of Kamal Bamadhaj, a university student from New Zealand
who was traveling through East Timor and was killed by Indonesian
soldiers when he became caught up in the graveyard demonstration.
Video of the massacre was smuggled out of Indonesia and showed
soldiers opening fire on unarmed demonstrators without provocation.
ATLANTA -- It used to be that the only numbers people routinely
checked for health were the ones on their bathroom scales.
But researchers are re-evaluating their recommendations on such
topics as weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, exercise and diet to
determine what really leads to healthy living. And after grinding
through the statistics, they've reached at least one conclusion:
Guidelines by the numbers are not guarantees that someone will
dodge an early death.
Yet, in the past decade, patients have become increasingly
interested in living life by the numbers. They want to know what
their blood pressure or blood sugar rates are. They weigh their
food and calculate their body fat.
An explosion of new data has resulted in some recent changes in
the benchmarks of good health causing confusion and frustration
for some. This month, the National Institutes of Health officially
deemed many of us still too fat to be in good health. At the same
time, a new study suggested blood pressure levels of 140/90 long
considered the target range are still too high, and people should
be getting to 120/80.
