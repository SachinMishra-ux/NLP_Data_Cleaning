Minutes after Campanis began speaking, the phones at ABC started
ringing, with viewers denouncing him for racist statements. The
next day, Robinson's widow, Rachel, Hank Aaron and baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth expressed dismay.
Campanis is survived by his sons, George and Jim, who caught for
the Dodgers, Kansas City and Pittsburgh, five grandchildren and
three great-grandchildren.
In the aftermath of the Campanis furor, Ueberroth was prompted
to make hiring of minority-group members in baseball a priority.
Major League Baseball created an affirmative-action program and
hired Harry Edwards, a black sociology professor at the University
of California, to identify black and Hispanic former players who
could work in baseball.
WASHINGTON After her testimony in the grand jury room, Gloria
Cabe was left with a memory of such prosecutorial zeal in the
performance of Jackie Bennett Jr. that four years later she still
finds it chilling for its unfettered aggressiveness.
But one witness's grand-jury attack dog can be his fellow
prosecutors' champion thoroughbred in the noir world of
public-integrity indictment and prosecution gunning for
politicians and public officials, in laymen's parlance.
Now, still fervidly on the president's case as it veers into
Clinton's behavior at the White House, Bennett suddenly finds
himself a lightning rod for anti-Starr critics and an embattled
stalwart to his career colleagues in the Department of Justice.
Critics are raising ethical questions about Bennett's role as
broker, one openly confirmed by Starr, in dealing with news media
interested in learning investigation secrets. At the same time,
supporters are counting on Bennett to break the logjam in the
Monica Lewinsky case in leading negotiations with her new lawyers
for a possible deal on testifying about her relationship with
President Clinton.
Friends and colleagues of Bennett, 41, insist he is only as
tough as he must be to do the right job. He is no mere eminence
grise in Starr's investigation of the president, they insist, but
rather a canny, multifaceted court performer exhilarated by his job
and, they maintain, as fair as he has to be.
This image of Jackie Bennett as more subtle than blunt is hard
for his latest adversaries at the White House to believe as they
watch him run a team of unyielding prosecutors here before the
federal grand jury.
Bennett relies on good-cop, bad-cop skills honed in 13 years in
the courtrooms and back rooms of prosecution. Physically and
professionally imposing his position was offensive tackle at
Hanover College in Indiana Bennett is a laureate prosecutor with
a booming voice, a standout in the dicey specialty of routing out
corrupt politicians.
