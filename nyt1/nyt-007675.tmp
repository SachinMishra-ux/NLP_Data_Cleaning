Rather than die a working man, Benarroch plotted his own suicide
for at least two years, police said, as part of an elaborate
insurance scheme to leave his children millionaires and still live
out his last years in style.
Police said a shady network of secret investors paid Benarroch's
life insurance premiums while Benarroch lived in a condo equipped
with a waterfall and stream.
Benarroch's $16 million scheme unfolds in files compiled by Palm
Beach County sheriff's deputies investigating the Feb. 12, 1997,
assassination of La Bergere outside the Tennis Club of Palm Beach
in suburban West Palm Beach. A man wearing a motorcycle helmet
wandered the parking lot and tennis courts for two hours before
shooting La Bergere, 64, nine times, police said.
The thick files of the La Bergere homicide case now sit in a box
waiting for a new lead, particularly the shooter's identity, said
sheriff's Detective Michael Wingate, who led the investigation.
Leads began drying up after a maid found Benarroch dead in his
$230-a-night room at The Cloister hotel on Sea Island, Ga., a year
ago this past Saturday. After months of investigation, Glenn
County, Ga., police Detective Neal Zealous concluded the death was
a suicide intended to look like an accident.
Detectives in Georgia and Florida learned Benarroch, a fanatical
tennis player, had approached friends in his tennis circles and
even an old University of Miami college roommate about an
opportunity to double their money.
Det. Zealous found Benarroch held insurance policies worth
nearly $16 million upon his death with four companies: Two with
Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, N.J., for $7
million and $2 million; one with Lincoln Benefit Life Company in
Lincoln, Neb., for $4 million; one with American General Corp. in
Houston, Texas, for $2 million; and one with Traveler's Life Annuities Co. in Hartford, Conn., for $950,000.
Wyllner could not be reached for comment. But according to the
statement he gave to police, Benarroch said he needed investors to
pay the more than $100,000 in insurance premiums per year until the
one- to two-year suicide clauses in the policies expired. Upon
Benarroch's death, the investors would double their money.
Then Benarroch explained why. He recalled how his father awoke
at 5 a.m. to sweep the family's little appliance store in Venezuela
when he was a young boy. His parents had worked so hard to give him
a good life; eventually, that little store grew into one of the
biggest stores in Caracas. In time, he inherited a fortune.
But as Benarroch reached his 60s, he realized he'd never held a
job and that at his current rate of spending, he would die a
pauper, leaving his two children nothing.
