A few years ago, businesses were all abuzz about TQM, Total
Quality Management. It's pretty much the same philosophy described
above, practiced in the workplace. Small-group meetings are held
regularly among employees, their ideas and suggestions are sought
and implemented as much as possible. The message is loud and clear:
You are important to this organization, you make a difference, we
value you, we're listening to you.
TQP should become the buzzword for all of us rearing children Total Quality Parenting. We should strive to make each family
member feel important, feel valued, know that his or her presence
makes a difference. Most important of all, perhaps, it would create
opportunities to listen, not lecture.
It's a pretty easy trap to parent like an autocrat. After all,
that's what many of our parents did, right?
I have a hunch many of us at times treat our co-workers and
friends with more courtesy and respect than we do our own family
members.
Our son helped his friend close down shop for the day, hopped in
the car and proudly showed me his take-home pay. When you're the
youngest of three sons, it's easy for your accomplishments to get
overlooked. After all, two others already have been there and done
that.
I've seen a lot of lemonade stands in my life, but until today I
hadn't seen this one the one that my son and his friend made. I
couldn't have been prouder of him, and I told him so.
Roasting food over fire is the oldest form of cooking in the
world; picture the caveman licking his fingers after a satisfying
cookout.
Nowadays, it's as popular as ever, especially in the United
States, where more than 75 percent of households own a grill.
That's according to figures from the Barbecue Institute of America,
an industry group in Chicago.
Men (and women) all over the world seem to get a thrill out of
their grills. Here's a little heated history to fire you up for a
Father's Day grill session:
Barbecuing in the U.S. has many roots. Ponce de Leon, on his
cruise through the Caribbean, found Haitians cooking over fire. He
brought their techniques to America when he landed in the 1500s, in
what has become Florida, according to the institute. Other parts of
America doubtless picked up their outdoor cooking tips from Indian
tribes, who used foods indigenous to their regions.
