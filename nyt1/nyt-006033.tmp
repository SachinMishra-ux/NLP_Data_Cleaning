For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for the 315 most sophisticated computer users in the
sample it is plus or minus six percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording or order of
questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.
This week the Lotus Development Corp. will begin shipping the
Smart Suite Millennium Edition, which includes the latest version
of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, word processing, data base,
graphics and other productivity software. The question is does
anyone care.
Battered by the relentless onslaught of Microsoft, Lotus has
seen its market share in desktop software dwindle so low that many
analysts no longer bother to track it. Although Smart Suite has
often been praised by reviewers and users as a cleaner,
less-cluttered alternative to Microsoft's Office 97, Microsoft's
ability to tie the applications to the Windows operating system has
proved an unbeatable advantage.
Smart Suite is to be shipped on Wednesday at a suggested retail
price of $399; the upgrade price for users of older Lotus or
competing programs is $149. In addition to 1-2-3, Smart Suite
includes the Word Pro word processor, Freelance Graphics
presentation application, Approach data base, Organizer time and
contact manager and Screencam multimedia tool. It also includes
Lotus Mail e-mail as well as both the Netscape Navigator 4.0 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 browsers.
Sales of the original IBM personal computer were driven by Lotus
1-2-3, which combined an accountant's spreadsheet with a program
that could turn the rows of numbers into charts and graphs. But
Lotus stumbled as the PC evolved. It was late to market with a
version of 1-2-3 for the Apple Macintosh, allowing Microsoft Excel
to grab that market; late again when Microsoft Windows took off,
ceding the PC itself to Excel, and late again when the market
turned to the bundles of applications called suites. IBM acquired a
weakened Lotus in June 1995.
While Lotus 1-2-3 was once the world's leading software program,
Smart Suite is a distant third behind Office 97 and Corel Corp.'s
Wordperfect Suite, said Ann Stephens, an analyst with PC Data.
Measured in units, Lotus' retail market share is 3.7 percent,
behind Corel's 26.5 percent and Microsoft's nearly 70 percent;
Lotus' corporate market share is 2 percent, behind Corel at 2.6
percent and Microsoft with more than 95 percent. In dollar terms,
Lotus has 2.4 percent of the retail and 2.2 percent of the
corporate markets.
Jeffrey Papows, president and chief executive at Lotus, says
Smart Suite's global market share is higher than these figures
indicate, about 7 percent in dollars, 22 to 24 percent in units,
and higher than Corel's share. He said 7 percent of a $5 billion
market was still worth pursuing, and a profitable business. But he
conceded that Smart Suite had been battered by Office 97, largely
because Microsoft could offer it to PC makers along with the
Windows operating system at terms no one could refuse.
Reviewers have long praised Smart Suite's superior integration
with Notes, Lotus' popular groupware program, which allows several
users to collaborate on documents and other projects across a
network. The new release adds stronger support for Domino, which
extends Notes to the World Wide Web for e-mail and other functions.
It also adds tools that enable users to create Web sites without
programming, and it incorporates IBM's voice-recognition
technology.
Lotus counts International Paper, Abbott Laboratories and Mars
among major companies using Smart Suite. Analysts say many
companies still use 1-2-3 even if they have adopted Microsoft
Office for word processing and graphics.
