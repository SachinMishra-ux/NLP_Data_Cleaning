The mellow candidate who appeared before his fellow Arizonans
that evening bore very little resemblance to the shoot-from-the-lip
conservative whose public utterances and presidential nomination
had fractured the Republican Party and scared the daylights out of
many Americans.
In a short time, he had managed to alienate millions of people
who viewed him as something of a mad bomber who would ignite
nuclear war. He also lost the support of millions who depended on
Social Security, the Tennessee Valley Authority, recently-enacted
civil rights laws and other federal policies that he had attacked.
The woman from Ridgewood was not alone among loyal Republicans
who voted for Barry Goldwater with trepidation.
In the endless pageant of individuals questing for the
presidency, he occupies an unusual place. He was a living paradox a colorful, outspoken westerner who was at once one of the 20th
century's worst candidates and one of its most memorable also-rans.
Like other defeated candidates such as Alf Landon in 1936,
George McGovern in 1972, and Michael Dukakis in 1988, Goldwater ran
a poor campaign. But like Wendell Willkie in 1940, Adlai Stevenson
in 1852 and 1956 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968, he voiced opinions
and defined issues that left a lasting imprint on the republic.
When the votes were counted in 1964, Goldwater had carried only
Arizona and five states of the Deep South. Lyndon Johnson prevailed
in the other 44 states and carried nearly two thirds of the popular
vote while the Republicans were losing 38 seats in the House and
two in the Senate.
Conservatives contend that Goldwater was simply ahead of his
time, and there may be some truth to that argument. But the larger
truth is that he was out of step with public sentiment in the
mid-1960s when a majority of Americans supported legislative
efforts to end legalized racial segregation and wanted to use their
government as an instrument to improve conditions for the poor, the
young and the aged.
There can be no question, however, that Goldwater was the
godfather of the modern conservatism that eventually landed Ronald
Reagan in the White House.
The Young Americans for Freedom who flocked to Goldwater's
rallies in the 1960s were adult voters and campaign workers by the
1980s.
But Goldwater did not share their enthusiasm for the agenda of
today's apostles of the religious right who would outlaw abortion,
install organized prayer in public schools and refuse to grant gays
the rights enjoyed by heterosexuals.
