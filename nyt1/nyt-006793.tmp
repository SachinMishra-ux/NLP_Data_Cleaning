NEW YORK Chinese authorities in Shanghai on Thursday detained
the shipment of sets and equipment for a classic Chinese opera that
is scheduled to be the centerpiece of next month's Lincoln Center
Festival, threatening to disrupt the New York event and start an
international incident.
When the criticisms first emerged this week, Lincoln Center
informally asked the State Department and the U.S. Information
Agency to follow the situation. After Thursday's action, in which
the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture refused permission for
sets from the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company to leave the airport,
the State Department intervened.
At the same time, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln
Center, sought help from Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of
state, who is a friend of hers. Because the production is scheduled
to move on to the Festival d'Automne in Paris in November, the
French Foreign Ministry has also become involved.
An American official who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that it was not clear whether the Chinese government, which is
preparing for a visit by President Clinton next week, had played
any part in the matter.
The shipment in question, consisting of all the sets, props and
costumes for the production, was ostensibly held back for an
inspection of the contents, according to Lincoln Center officials.
The authorities allowed the containers to be reclosed, Redden
said, adding that he hoped they would be shipped on the next
available flight, on Sunday. But he said the authorities still had
objections to the production that could pose further problems.
WASHINGTON With Democrats maintaining that the Republican
leadership was once again trying to delay any final vote on
campaign finance, the House voted Thursday to open the debate to a
blizzard of amendments.
The procedure rare in a House that is usually controlled
tightly to allow only limited debate and a handful of amendments was approved on a near-party-line vote, 221-189. Republican
proponents of overhauling campaign finance law stood with their
party after receiving assurances from the House Majority Leader
Dick Armey that the issue would be brought to a final vote by the
time the House takes its August recess.
From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
majority whip, an opponent of the overhaul effort, mocked the
complaints.
