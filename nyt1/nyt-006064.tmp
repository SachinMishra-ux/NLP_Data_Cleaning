It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
