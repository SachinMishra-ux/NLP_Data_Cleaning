Segui misplayed Darin Erstad's inning-opening grounder in the
first and ex-Mariner Dave Hollins doubled to right. Jim Edmonds
then delivered a two-run single to right field.
The bobble forced Segui to hold the runner on base and open a
hole between first and second. Hollins found it with a line drive.
The Angels, knocking the Rangers out of first place for the
first time since April 7, scored the eventual game-winning run in
the third inning off Bob Wells.
After Segui's double put runners on second and third with one
out, Edgar Martinez hit a run-scoring infield out and Glenallen
Hill scored another with his second double of the game.
But until the sixth, another familiar Mariner problem
re-emerged: the inability to get hits with runners in scoring
position. Seattle had runners on second base in each of the first
four innings and none advanced.
PARIS Tab Ramos was just one of 22 clueless Americans eight
years ago on an adventure they had no hope to comprehend. Thrown
into the World Cup the United States' first since 1950 the Yanks
arrived in Italy as tourists, as rank amateurs taking on seasoned
pros. They found themselves headed home, humiliated, just two weeks
later.
It's a memory that popped into his head Monday night as he
looked on in disgust as the Americans, now professionals with World
Cup aspirations, were overpowered by Germany in their World Cup
opener. He couldn't abide the hesitation in the United States'
play, the manner with which they backed down to the Germans in the
first 45 minutes of the clash at Parc des Princes.
Balboa, too, was part of that team; Lalas was in the stands, his
face painted red, white and blue, his dreams of Cup glory still
four years off. They didn't enjoy what they saw Monday night,
either, but it was Ramos who felt he must speak out.
The reasons behind that are arguable. Some, Reyna included,
believe Coach Steve Sampson left too many experienced players
Ramos, Balboa and Lalas included on the bench. Others, among them
Sampson, think the Yanks reacted poorly after surrendering an early
goal and couldn't bounce back. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a
pretty sight; aside from the first 15 minutes or so of the second
half, the United States had no business being on the field with
Germany.
That would be the end of the Americans' Cup. A victory over the
Iranians is essential to keeping its second-round hopes alive, and
some sort of positive result a win or a tie; we won't know which
until after Sunday also is necessary against Yugoslavia on June 25.
