Our young friend Beavis is computer literate, so his problem
seems to be something other than stupidity. He is, according to his
grandfather, quite sensitive and easily wounded. Apparently, it
doesn't occur to him that other people can be wounded, too. Or,
more likely, he doesn't much care.
Beavis had several of the girls bragging about sex with
teachers, about getting pregnant and having abortions, about their
affection for exotic sex acts. Thoughtfully, he also included their
e-mail addresses.
The girls found out about it, of course. So did the school. The
district saw it as sexual harassment. The kid was suspended for
five days. The district is considering more action against him, but
it has no authority to expel him from school.
In the perpetually benevolent state of New York, expulsion from
school doesn't exist. Every New York citizen is guaranteed a free
public education until age 21, regardless of behavior. By law, the
maximum suspension lasts only a year, and the kid gets private
tutoring at public expense.
The cops did pay Beavis a visit. They did their best to scare
the hell out of him, but there's nothing they can really do to him.
If the kid had sent this material directly to the girls, that would
have constituted aggravated harassment. But sending false,
defamatory filth out to the universe via the Internet violates no
criminal law of the State of New York.
What Beavis did, however, does seem to constitute libel. That's
according to my home newspaper's hot-shot First Amendment lawyer,
Mike (The Hammer) Grygiel. So, the girls could sue the kid and take
everything he has. Given his age, that's probably not much.
But if some jury awarded the mud-splattered girls nothing more
than Beavis' computer and his collection of dirty pictures, they'd
be doing humanity an enormous favor.
Water managers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have crafted
a $7.5 billion plan for creating a healthier, more natural
Everglades while expanding South and Central Florida's water supply
during the next half-century.
But even supporters acknowledged that the blueprint needs a lot
of work before they can present it to Congress next summer.
The plan would be the linchpin of what water managers call the
largest, most complex ecological restoration ever. Yet it faces
skepticism from some state and federal scientists, who say the plan
would go too far in serving farms and cities without fully
restoring the Everglades' natural flow.
