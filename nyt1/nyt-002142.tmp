His acceptance speech, which began with a nostalgic snap-shop of
his immigrant family tree, took on the media as much as it did his
would-be opponent.
He criticized editorial writers and national newspapers for
failing to understand his work and defended his fund-raising as a
strategy designed to make sure he has the means to take his message
directly to the people.
As of April, D'Amato, chairman of the powerful Senate Banking
Committee, had raised $17 million and had $10.8 million on hand to
spend, dwarfing the sums collected by the three Democrats vying for
their party's nod to run against the 18-year incumbent.
The Democratic Party, however, has made it clear that D'Amato is
their primary target in the upcoming races in New York. His
potential opponents are former vice presidential candidate and talk
show host Geraldine Ferraro; U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer; and New
York City Public Advocate Mark Green.
But D'Amato, who is trailing in polls and painted himself as the
beleaguered underdog on Friday, did say he intends to campaign
aggressively.
One of the biggest groups the senator is tackling this year are
the teachers, who wield ample political muscle and campaign cash.
D'Amato, who has called for merit pay for good teachers and an
end to automatic tenure, reiterated his education reform goals on
Friday.
The Solomon Islands, a tiny country in the Pacific with a
population of 400,000, has no army and a police force of barely a
thousand including traffic cops. But last summer the government
purchased enough equipment to outfit a small combat unit including
assault rifles, machine guns, helmets, boots and two small
airplanes from a U.S. company.
At the Pentagon and the U.S. Customs Service, officials
expressed misgivings about the sale, fearing that the weapons and
the gear were destined for rebels in nearby Papau, New Guinea.
Others argued that it would be better for the Solomon Islands to
invest in health and education. Australia and New Zealand also
opposed the deal, believing it was irresponsible to be bringing
more weapons into the region.
But the State Department accepted that the arms were necessary
for the police and issued the necessary licenses. Since then, a
newly elected government in the Solomon Islands, suspicious about
the motives for the arms deal, has launched an investigation and
tried to cancel it.
