If you have one of these accounts and do end up using a live
teller when you could have used an ATM, you'll pay a fee that is
usually about $3 but could be as much as $9.50, according to Bank
Rate Monitor.
Even for full-service accounts, banks will often reduce or
eliminate fees if you maintain multiple accounts, keep a minimum
balance like $1,000 in your checking account or sign up for direct
deposit of your paycheck or Social Security payments.
The best credit card strategy is to pay off your bills each
month, thereby benefitting from use of the money (or float) during
the free grace period and no interest or fees.
Web sites that carry information on checking and credit card
rates and fees include Bank Rate Monitor (www.bankrate.com), RAM

 P RSatan,S just like in MatthewUs gospel, was foiled again
yesterday. P Hopefully for U.S. soccer, this humbling wonUt end up in
someoneUs sermon
2,000 years from now. P For the proud niche of soccer fans in the
United States, there should be
comfort in knowing that their grand game did not disgrace the
nation yesterday in Lyon, France. P No. By the time that the clock
ran out on IranUs 2-1 victory, much of the
American viewing audience was either (A) napping or (B) watching
golf on TV. P Ten years of trying to pick up the game by its
kneesocks, of bidding for
and then successfully staging the U94 World Cup, of trying to build
a U.S. team that could earn respect on the world stage Q and this
is what they get? P In Iran, where they once referred to us as
RThe Great Satan,S the victory
prompted midnight prayers and dancing in the streets. The Iranians
scored two goals, but huge points more for their sportsmanship and
the heart that they showed. P Here at home, alas, it was hard to
swallow. In terms of a future Q read
Rcorporate dollarsS Q the defeat may not have delivered a death
blow to soccer in this country. But at the moment, consider it down
and bleeding. P For one day, soccer had the U.S. viewing audience
mostly to itself. People
who didnUt know a soccer ball from a frozen ham suddenly had a
storyline they could sink their teeth into. A Ted Koppel kind of
game. To a lot of Americans, still, mention of Iran brings back
memories of the hostage crisis, the Ayatollah Khomeini and U.S.
flags being burned in the Tehran streets. P And what? You said
Team USA was heavily favored? P You bet they watched. P But it was more of the same, wasnUt it? The U.S. playersU
inability to put
the ball in the net turned into a night of frustration. They hit
the crossbar. They hit the goalposts Q three times. And now, after
one more World Cup match, they will hit the road. P Spare the
e-mails, please. TheyUve become trite. P After I penned a fairly light-hearted piece 12 days ago, teasing
how the
World Cup gets lost in the U.S. translation, I received a spate of
electronic dispatches rife with name-calling and high-handed piety. P Ron Pitney of Arlington wrote, RYour refusal to learn the game
amounts to
intellectual bankruptcy and until you take the time to really
understand the Tgame within the gameU you really should limit your
comments to those sports you understand!S P Ah, yes, the Rgame
within the gameS of soccer. At least two of the e-mail
writers claimed that soccer is now the preferred sport of
Rintelligent people,S and thus they understood perfectly why only
they grasped its nuances Q and, apparently, I didnUt. P While they
were memorizing Chaucer, I suppose, they must have missed the
fact that nowhere in the earlier column did I say I didnUt like
soccer, the apparent Official Game of Mensa. I simply strove to
make points about the World CupUs lack of scoring, particularly the
U.S. teamUs. And while praising World Cup U94 for its success,
despite the rest of the worldUs skepticism, I noted how the great
event still doesnUt captivate the same throngs on our shores. P Suddenly, I think I was on the same mailing list as Salman
Rushdie. P RYou people are morons if you canUt see that soccer is HUGE with
an
educated segment of the population,S read one of the unsigned
notes. P I give up. What donUt we morons understand? P ThereUs offsides. ThereUs corner kicks. There are yellow cards
and red
cards. Soccer is not rocket science. As has been proven many times
at the World Cup, the coaches donUt even need to speak the playersU
language. P The best e-mail comment, as it turned out, came from a
truly erudite
gentleman named Norm Biven. He called my attention to the
commercial that Nike is running during the Cup telecasts. It shows
the defending world champs from Brazil stuck during a flight delay
at the Rio airport. They begin playing with the soccer ball, while
a samba from Sergio Mendes plays in the background. P They and the
ball go through X-ray machines, under taxiing jet wings, down
baggage ramps, before the worldUs best player, Ronaldo, finishes
with a footwork exhibition that would make the Globetrotters
envious. The punch line is that Ronaldo gets to the terminal gate,
kicks Q and clangs it off the metal post. P The kids watching
frown. Ronaldo shrugs. P RJust because RonaldoUs shot clangs off the post at the end
doesnUt make it
any less entertaining,S Biven wrote. RItUs not the scoring. ItUs
the samba, silly.S P I know. But again, thanks to days like
yesterday, it gets lost in the
translation. P Americans love underdogs, but they enjoy winning
more. The samba is fine,
but the preferred tune, last time I checked, was I We Will Rock
You. P TennisU Davis Cup was big once here, too Q until the United States
started losing it. P U.S. soccer blew it big time yesterday. It
doesnUt take a genius to see
that itUs going to be a tough four years.
There are about 165,000 ATMs in the United States and they
handle 900 million transaction a month, or nearly double the number
a decade ago.
Despite all the publicity about ATM fees, cash machines have yet
to be the financial windfall so many banks expected.
An average-sized bank might spend $20 million to $25 million a
year on a network of 1,000 ATMs, according to McKinsey. That's a
net cost of $20,000 to $25,000 per machine after taking into
account fees charged to customers and other banks.
It's not surprising that ATMs are expensive to buy, maintain and
keep stocked. Average annual operating costs per machine, including
transaction processing expenses, depreciation and maintenance, run
about $41,000 per year. But total revenue is only about $18,000,
according to McKinsey.
That's a shortfall of $23,000 per machine which banks are trying
to reduce by selling products such as stamps and imposing
transaction fees.
