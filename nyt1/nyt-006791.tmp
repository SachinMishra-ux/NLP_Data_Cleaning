It may be none, or all, of the above. Certainly the biggest
worry for investors the threat of interminable litigation and
overwhelming punitive damages from the hundreds of lawsuits that
have been filed against tobacco companies remained. Without
restrictions on such lawsuits and awards, many people who might
otherwise buy into tobacco companies were staying away, not wanting
to put their money into companies whose earnings could be siphoned
off by having to make all those payments.
There are other issues that went away, more or less, along with
the bill, which was sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. One was
the spectre of higher prices for cigarettes, which some feared
would create a contraband market for them. Another was spending for
programs to reduce youth smoking, which was also a major element of
the June 20 plan.
Take a look at what would happen if Philip Morris, say, broke up
into several small companies and eliminated domestic tobacco sales
from its balance sheet. Right away, the remaining businesses international tobacco, Kraft Foods and Miller Brewing Co. would
be worth about $66 a share, Goldman estimated. Adding a
conservative valuation for domestic tobacco back in would raise the
price by about $12 a share, he said, bringing the price to $78, or
nearly twice what the stock was selling for Thursday.
Turning to RJR Nabisco, one could do the same. Goldman said the
company without its domestic tobacco business was worth about $47,
and $58 with the domestic tobacco added in.
DALLAS The cutbacks coursing through the chip industry reached
Texas Instruments Inc. on Thursday as the company announced plans
to eliminate 3,500 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force. The
company cited both the recent sale of several divisions and a weak,
glutted market for chips, especially in Asia.
The cut follows word in April that National Semiconductor was
chopping 1,400 jobs and Intel 3,000 jobs, and word in June that
Motorola was eliminating 15,000 jobs.
To further protect itself, Texas Instruments reached an
agreement Thursday to sell its computer memory-chip business to
Micron Technology Inc. for about $641 million in stock plus $190
million in debt. The deal, which was expected, will make Micron
Technology the world's largest maker of memory chips, with about 18
percent of the market, several percentage points more than Samsung.
Of the 3,500 jobs to be cut, about 2,500 will be in the United
States, including 600 from the closing of a memory-chip plant near
the company's base in Dallas. The cutback will save the company
about $270 million a year before taxes, but incentives and other
costs will roughly equal the savings over the first year. The
company anticipates some layoffs, with the number depending on how
many workers depart voluntarily.
Having already sold off military electronics and laptop-computer
divisions, Texas Instruments will remain a maker of specialized
chips, primarily those called digital signal processors, which are
used in cellular phones, computer networking equipment, cars and
computer components such as modems and hard drives. Though demand
for these chips is growing rapidly, Aylesworth said that computer
makers already had excessive inventories of components such as hard
drives.
Micron Technology plans to capitalize on its position as the
memory-chip industry's low-cost producer. To make the necessary
investments, especially in the purchased operations, Micron
Technology won an agreement to borrow $750 million from Texas
Instruments.
