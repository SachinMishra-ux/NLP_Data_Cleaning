One subject likely to interest those institutional investors is
what happens to Berkshire Hathaway after Buffett, who is 67,
retires or dies. General Re's board had similar questions in
considering the merger, Buffett said.
Ronald Ferguson, chairman and chief executive of General Re, who
will become a Berkshire director as part of the merger, said,
however, that except concerning the operations of General Re, he is
not in line to play any part in those succession plans.
Institutions might also wonder what Buffett is going to do with
the $24 billion in new investment capital that will come into the
company from General Re's operations. Only about $5 billion of that
is invested in common stocks currently, Buffett said, with the
balance in fixed income, and the biggest portion of that in
municipal bonds.
Buffett, who recently has said that he has had a hard time
finding cheap stocks to buy, admitted that he did not yet know the
answer to that.
NEW YORK Joao Gilberto may well be the coolest man alive. The
unassuming, bespectacled, 67-year-old singer walked on stage
without introduction or ceremony at Carnegie Hall on Friday, sat
down with his guitar and proceeded to play one quietly haunting
bossa nova after another for 90 minutes, putting a preternatural
hush over the sold-out audience.
He sang as if he were alone, communing with his guitar. His
fingers brushed featherweight syncopated chords; his voice, just
above a whisper, contemplated love and music, beauty and sadness.
During songs and between them, he hunched over his guitar, nearly
motionless but for his restless, knowing fingers. Every so often he
would swing one knee to his own irresistible rhythms. And once,
just once, he smiled.
Gilberto's repertory has come from Antonio Carlos Jobim, Dorival
Caymmi and other brilliant composers; he lends the songs a luminous
gentleness, at once concentrated and serene. Now, in a rare tour to
mark the 40th anniversary of that first single, Gilberto was
teasing out new secrets from his earliest songs.
Gilberto's voice is still almost weightless, but it's not as
smooth now as it was; there are scratches in it, and its lower
notes can shade into husky ambiguity.
He circled in on the songs, singing through the verses
straightforwardly and then returning to them more freely, letting
his voice float and drift away from the dependable pulse of his
guitar, as if he was still mulling over how he should feel.
Every so often, he turned to scat-singing, like a muffled
trombone. His voice and guitar achieved subtle, impish feats of
timing and harmony, though he never flaunted them. Yet he was so
understated that any modest musical variation, like a key change or
a shift in his guitar rhythm, arrived like a thunderclap.
