The jockey showcase is a departure for a regionalized industry
that has been slow to react to the onslaught of legalized gambling
and the sophisticated marketing techniques of other sports.
Twenty-five years ago, horse racing accounted for 28 percent of all
legally wagered money. In 1996, it totaled 7.8 percent, according
to International Gaming and Wagering Business magazine. Attendance
at the nation's tracks has declined from 54.4 million in 1991 to
34.4 million today.
But 80,162 people showed up at Belmont Park this month to
witness Victory Gallop launch a stirring stretch drive and prevent
Real Quiet from completing the first Triple Crown in 20 years. It
was the second straight year that a horse had gone to Belmont with
a chance to win the Triple Crown, comprising the Kentucky Derby,
the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. And it was the second
straight year that the bid ended with a narrow defeat at the wire.
At the Lone Star jockey competition, those faces were among the
most accomplished in the sport. As a group, the 12 have won more
than 57,000 races for a staggering $1.56 billion in purses,
including victories in 38 Triple Crown events and 51 Breeders' Cup
races. But they also represented a cross-section of the sport's
potential appeal.
They ranged in age from 25-year-old Marlon St. Julien, a black
rider who is becoming a star on the Texas-Louisiana circuit, to
51-year-old Laffit Pincay, a legendary Panamanian who is pursuing
Bill Shoemaker's career record of 8,833 victories.
Jerry Bailey, a three-time Eclipse award winner, and Mike Smith
represented New York. Pat Day, a five-time Preakness winner, and
Sellers came from Kentucky. Canada's leading rider, Sandy Hawley,
was also on hand. Eddie Delahoussaye, Kent Desormeaux and Chris
McCarron, with Stevens and Pincay, rounded out the California
contingent. Krone, the most heralded female jockey, came from New
Jersey.
Lone Star Park conducted the program with both the new fan and
the educated gambler in mind north Texas possesses a
knowledgeable fan base that for years traveled to nearby Arkansas
and Louisiana to play the horses. The jockeys were mobbed at a
pre-race autograph session, and bands blasted rock-and-roll between
races.
The track even came up with a special wager available here and
in 138 simulcast sites nationwide, allowing fans to bet on which
jockey would win the championship. Sellers paid $14.80 for a $2 bet
to win the contest, and he and Krone together paid $150.80 for a $2
exacta.
It is that same combination of promotion and quality racing
(Lone Star offers a daily average of $200,000 in purses) that has
attracted the country's top horses and trainers, including the best
in the stable of Bob Baffert, the trainer of both Silver Charm and
Real Quiet.
Those efforts have helped Lone Star Park average 9,700 in daily
attendance and improve its wagering handle by 5 percent over last
year, to more than $3.1 million a day. This has been accomplished
despite the presence of four major league sports franchises and
auto racing within a 35-mile radius of the track.
All of which is perfectly plausible. So what, Lewis Carroll asks
in one of his books about symbolic logic, is the proper conclusion?
