That's why I didn't argue when he told me on the way home from
swim practice one night that it was time to look for a new club. I
was 16 then and much older when I found out one of my coaches that
night had told my father I could go a long way with a little help
from certain chemicals.
When it came time to visiting colleges, it seemed perfectly
natural that my father ride shotgun. The night he left me in the
care of some swimmers at USC, my dad walked to a nearby restaurant
to grab a bite to eat. As he was walking back to his hotel, a
stranger appeared out of nowhere and blocked his path.
And yet he let me go, to find my own way, as he knew even the
most loving father must.
I was out of sight but never out of his mind. My first year in
college, my father flew to L.A. to surprise me at our conference
swim meet at East L.A. College. The only problem was, he drove to
West L.A. College by mistake. Somehow he managed to find his way to
the right pool in time to catch my big race.
Devotion, thy name is Dad. For mine and every other one out
there like him, this day's for you.
Same goes for their rivals, though, who lost their opener to
Yugoslavia and figure they'll have little hope against the Germans.
If the political pressure from home is greater on Iran, the
sporting pressure is greater on the US, which came here
legitimately hoping to make the second round, then played like awed
amateurs for the first half of a 2-0 loss to the Germans.
So the US is determined to attack the Iranians from the opening
whistle, create multiple scoring chances, and knock in at least a
couple of goals. That hasn't happened often this year, but the
Yanks concede that it had better happen Sunday.
The Yanks were imposed upon by the Germans, giving up a goal in
the ninth minute and not managing a shot on goal until the 30th.
Not this time, vows their coach, who said his squad will be running
and banging and risking from the go.
Even so, the Americans concede that beating Iran won't be easy,
even though the Iranians needed a near-miracle to qualify. They
know Iran will come in pumped to the skies by the idea of knocking
off Uncle Sam. They remember that Iran came from two goals down
with 14 minutes left to tie Australia on the road to get here. And
they've seen the videos of Iran's 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia, when the
goal came on a free kick 18 minutes from time.
