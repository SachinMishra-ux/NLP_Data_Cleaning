Still, the Angels taking a senior with little bargaining power
so high in the draft was surprising. It will give Etherton and
adviser Craig Landis an extra leg to stand on when negotiations get
under way. A closer look, however, reveals the Angels' motivations
are not totally without foundation. Etherton was burned in contract
negotiations a year ago after St. Louis made him a ninth-round pick
and he is eager to navigate an easier path this time around. It
will be easier knowing it takes less than a half-hour to get from
Edison Field to his parents' home in Dana Point, where he was
reared on Angels baseball.
As important is the Troy Glaus phenomenon. The Angels' first
pick a year ago held out all summer long, missing out on a full
minor-league season. Some think it cost him a spot on the big club
this season. Etherton will be much easier to pin down.
Also notable, the Angels realize that Glaus has made headlines
this season not only because of his numbers he had a
minor-league-high 19 homers (more than 30 other minor-league
!ital!teams!off!) at the time of his call-up last week to Triple-A
Vancouver but also because he went to nearby UCLA.
Second time's the charm: It was just before the 1995 season that
a struggling shortstop mired in the depths of the Detroit Tigers
organization decided to make a change.
Now, just three years later, Bryan Corey is a major-leaguer. He
was recently called up by his new club, the Arizona Diamondbacks,
as a pitcher.
Corey, 24, hit .128 in 180 at bats when he and the Tigers
decided he should be getting batters out, not being a batter that
got out. By 1996, he was 6-4 with a 1.21 ERA and 34 saves for
Single-A Fayetteville, thanks in part to a mean sinker. Last year,
he was 3-8 with nine saves at Double-A Jacksonville.
The D'Backs liked what they saw, taking him in the third round
of the 1997 expansion draft. At the time of his call-up, he was 3-0
with a 1.77 ERA. In three appearances with the big club, he has
allowed four earned runs and six hits in four innings.
Full speed ahead: With the draft complete, the short-season
Single-A leagues and rookie leagues will blossom from nothingness
to full-roster status for Opening Day II June 16.
First-year players accrued from the draft and free-agent
signings will report to two Single-A leagues (New York-Penn League
and Northwest League) and two Rookie League teams (Appalachian
League and Pioneer League).
Attorney General Janet Reno made the right call in preserving
the right of Oregon residents to seek physician-assisted suicide in
that state. Last November, Thomas Constantine, the administrator of
the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, announced that doctors in
Oregon who acted under that state's assisted suicide law would be
subject to severe federal sanctions, including revocation of their
right to prescribe drugs. The DEA is responsible for enforcing
federal drug laws, but it has no right to substitute its own
judgment for the judgment of Oregon voters who resoundingly
affirmed their support for the state's Death With Dignity Act by a
60 percent vote last November.
