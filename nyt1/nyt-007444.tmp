A Brooklyn native, he served in Europe in World War II, and,
upon returning, went into the restaurant business begun in 1894 by
his grandparents. Besides running his various restaurants, he was
chairman of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Board,
and he helped found the Fort Greene Civic Center.
The Community Mayors group was a revival of an organization
called the Locality Mayors that was founded in 1875 in Manhattan.
For a time, every block on the Lower East Side had a member,
usually a politician or saloon keeper to whom people would take
their troubles and receive rent money or a Christmas turkey in
return for their votes.
Under the leadership of Louis Zeltner, a newspaperman, the group
became a charity and shed its political associations, but it broke
up after his death decades ago. Della Rocca adopted the idea as a
way to aid the disabled.
He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a daughter, Shelley Aprea
of Flemington, N.J.; a son, Peter J., of Cranford, N.J.; and two
granddaughters.
Dr. Daniel I. Axelrod, a paleoecologist at the University of
California at Davis who reconstructed the ancient landscapes of the
West by examining plant fossils, died on June 2 at his home in
Davis. He was 87.
Axelrod reported how wet forests slowly turned into Nevada's
deserts over 40 million years of the Earth's cooling and heating
and tracked the migration of plants to places that suited them
better.
Some of Axelrod's most important work came after he retired as a
professor of geology and botany at Davis and became what many
colleges call an emeritus professor, with no teaching to do. Before
long, he won an award as the outstanding researcher at Davis, won
top awards from several national research organizations and
received a Guggenheim fellowship to boot.
Axelrod roamed the world looking at how plants adapt to new
environments, and he came up with ways to account for the migration
of entire forests in response to climate changes.
He documented the evolution of America's grasslands, its central
prairies, the deserts of Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada, and the
zones of thorny thickets called chaparral in the foothills of the
Rockies and the Sierra Nevada.
All this, said Dr. Michael Barbour, a botanist and professor of
environmental horticulture at Davis, was a scope of work achieved
by few botanists. Axelrod created maps showing how plant
communities evolved through most of the Western United States.
