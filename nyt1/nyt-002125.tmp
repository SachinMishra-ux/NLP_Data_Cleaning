Constantine, who issued his threat after being pressed to
consider the Oregon law by two senior conservative members of
Congress, had said that using drugs for suicide was not a
legitimate medical use under the federal drug laws.
In reversing that position Friday, Reno said that a Justice
Department study concluded that the drug laws were intended to
block illegal trafficking in drugs and did not cover situations
like the Oregon suicide law.
It remains unclear whether her ruling will increase the number
of people who seek to use the Oregon law because doctors might now
be less inhibited to help people end their lives.
Dr. Charles Hoffman, the former president of the state medical
society, had complained that Constantine's threat had chilled many
doctors from prescribing lethal drugs to patients eligible under
the law.
Only three people are reported to have used the law since it
survived a series of other legal challenges last fall.
The law was written to be used only by Oregon residents in order
to prevent the state from becoming a mecca for people seeking
medical help in ending their lives. Other states have rejected such
laws and the next test may come in Michigan, where proponents are
preparing an initiative to be put on the ballot.
In her ruling, Reno said there was no evidence that Congress
meant for the DEA to have the novel role of resolving the profound
moral and ethical questions involved in the issue. In her statement
she noted that President Clinton remains opposed to
physician-assisted suicide and signed a law prohibiting the use of
federal funds for any such procedure.
Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., one of Congress' most prominent
abortion foes, said Friday he is confident that there will be a
legislative attempt to undo Reno's ruling. Congressional aides said
that some of the efforts will be similar to those used to deter
abortions, like requiring waiting periods or mandatory counseling.
The ruling was greeted warmly not only by supporters of the
referendum but by some Oregonians who opposed the measure but felt
angered that politicians and agency administrators in Washington
had sought to undo the results of the election.
The initial referendum was approved by a 51-49 margin in 1994
but was held up by legal challenges for three years.
