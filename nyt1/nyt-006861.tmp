According to ACNielsen EDI research, the average gross for
movies made from television shows this decade is $60.6 million. The
average for all other films in wide release is $35.2 million.
If the celebration turns out to be profitable, the possibilities
for television producers who want to make movies is nearly endless,
Borys said.
But Borys doesn't think just anyone can do it. Sitcoms couldn't
make the translation, he said.
NEW YORK Finding that young surgeons at New York University
Medical Center were working far more hours than the law allows in
some cases up to 130 hours a week state health officials fined
the hospital $16,000 Thursday.
It was the first time that the state fined a hospital
specifically for violating the decade-old law aimed at protecting
patients from doctors who are overworked or deprived of sleep. But
health officials, under increasing criticism for not enforcing the
regulations, warned last month that they were stepping up the pace
of inspections and would punish offenders.
New York Medical Center, one of the city's most prestigious
hospitals, became the first to be fined under the state's new
vigilance. An inspection there in mid-May found that 10 of 18
surgical residents worked more than the 80-hour limit, and 12 of
them worked 30 to 36 hours straight. The law bars residents from
working more than 24 hours straight.
The state investigation found the violations only in the
surgical training programs, with the cardiac-surgery department the
worst. All four first-year cardiac residents were found to be
working between 110 and 130 hours a week.
The hospital released a statement acknowledging the problem and
saying that it has formed a committee to make sure that it follows
the law.
But the statement also noted that the problem existed at other
institutions. In May, after several months of mounting criticism
from medical experts, in newspaper articles and from other public
officials, Dr. DeBuono completed an investigation of 12 hospitals many of them among the best in the state and determined that all
12 were violating the laws.
The day the report was released, Dr. DeBuono sent investigators
to three other hospitals, including New York University Medical
Center, and found only NYU had violated the laws, passed in 1989.
