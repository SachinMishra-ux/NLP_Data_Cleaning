Alfred Kazin was born on June 5, 1915, the son of Charles Kazin,
a house painter, and the former Gita Fagelman, a dressmaker, both
of whom had emigrated as youths from czarist Russia. From his
childhood in Brownsville, Kazin and his sister, Pearl, were imbued
with the immigrant, working-class values that were to sustain a
society through the Great Depression.
His entry into the world of letters began almost by accident.
Like so many of the new generation of young intellectuals in New
York City, sons and daughters of immigrants for the most part,
Kazin attended City College, honing his literary sensibilities and
opinions from the many newspapers and magazines that were published
in the city through the Depression.
Kazin spent most of the next 60 years writing. He earned his
bachelor's degree in 1935 from City College and his master's degree
in English three years later. He began writing reviews and essay
for other magazines and took a strong interest in the new writing
of the time. In 1937, Carl Van Doren, then a professor at Columbia
University, suggested that he undertake a book-length study of
modern American literature.
But the memoir established Kazin as one of the country's leading
postwar voices and commanded a growing readership drawn to its
evocative prose:
In between publication dates, Kazin earned his living writing
reviews and essays for newspapers and magazines like American
Mercury, Partisan Review, The New Yorker and Harper's Magazine. He
was literary editor of The New Republic and an associate editor of
Fortune. He also wrote countless introductions to reprint editions
of classic and more contemporary works.
Kazin was also a guest professor at universities in the United
States and abroad. He taught at Harvard, Smith, Notre Dame,
Berkeley, Cambridge, Cologne and the University of Puerto Rico, to
name only a few. He later held distinguished professorships at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the City
University of New York, at Hunter College and the Graduate Center.
His colleagues included Irving Howe and Irving Kristol, Norman
Podhoretz, Lionel and Diana Trilling, William Barrett, William
Phillips, Mary McCarthy, Sidney Hook and Harold Rosenberg. Many of
the friendships did not survive professional jealousies and the
rise of neoconservatism.
His love affair with literature carried him through a sometimes
stormy private life that included four marriages. His first was to
Natasha Dohn, also the daughter of Russian immigrants. The marriage
ended in divorce, and he married Caroline Bookman, with whom he had
a son, Michael. That marriage lasted three years, and in 1952, he
wed Ann Birstein, a novelist, with whom he had a daughter,
Cathrael. He married Judith Dunford, also a writer, in 1983.
He is survived by his wife; a son, Michael of Chevy Chase, Md.;
a daughter, Cathrael Kazin of Jerusalem; two stepsons, Jonathan
Dunford of Paris and Nathaniel Dunford of New York; a stepdaughter,
Hilary Shanahan of New York; a sister, Pearl Bell of Boston; two
grandchildren and five stepgrandchildren .
