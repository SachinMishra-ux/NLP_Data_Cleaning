Stewart took control of his destiny by reaching the green at the
par-5 first hole in two shots, then dropping a 15-foot eagle putt.
In three rounds, Stewart is 4 under at No. 1 and 1 over for the
rest of the course.
The bottom line, all agree, will depend on whether Stewart opens
the door for those in his rearview mirror. Through three rounds, he
has three-putted one green. His nine bogeys are the fewest of any
player on the leader board.
He has the chance, on Father's Day, to finish a quest that
started with his late father, Bill, in the 1955 Open at Olympic.
Bill Stewart, a club pro from Springfield, Mo., missed the cut in
that event by shooting 83-88. His son, Payne, has a chance to win
on the same course 43 years later.
Stewart reflected yesterday on what advice his father would have
given him heading into the final round.
At the Antiquorum auction of important timepieces in midtown
Manhattan, the answer was a record-breaking $1.1 million, for a
yellow gold Patek Philippe wristwatch with perpetual calendar and
moon phases. Only three of its kind were made. It was believed to
be the highest price ever paid for a watch in the United States.
The previous record was $786,000, for a Patek Philippe sold by
Christie's in 1996.
The watch sold on Saturday, to an unnamed American collector,
was among a dazzling inventory that included a Patek Philippe
wristwatch that had belonged to the jazz great Duke Ellington.
Ellington bought his waterproof watch, yellow gold with a round
button split-second chronograph, in Geneva on July 28, 1948. An
unnamed German collector bought it on Saturday for $673,500. Its
value, prior to the auction, had been estimated at $150,000 to
$180,000.
The auction was the second held this year in New York City by
Antiquorum, an auction house based in Geneva that sells fine
timepieces around the world, and it comes at a time when luxury
watch sales are booming. Manhattan dealers report brisk sales of
new watches in the $25,000 to $75,000 range.
But unlike the young tycoons snapping up Rolexes, Breguets, and
newer Patek Philippes, the buyers on Saturday were keen-eyed
collectors, aficionados of horology, the 500-year-old artful
science of building devices that measure time.
Primarily, they are motivated by two things: quality and rarity,
said Osvaldo Patrizzi, the chairman of Antiquorum.
