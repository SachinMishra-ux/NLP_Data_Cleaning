It is the first time the newly developed vacuum-assisted closure
(VAC) device, has been used to reduce the often devastating
aftereffects of a snakebite.
Invented by Louis Argenta, a plastic surgeon from the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem,
N.C., the VAC wound system is being made by a Texas-based company,
Kinetic Concepts. Argenta says that by getting rid of fluid, the
VAC can make wounds heal four times faster than they would
otherwise.
The tiger snake victim had been bitten on the foot. Although her
life was saved by an antivenin injection, a hole 3 centimeters
square opened up around the bite, and her foot swelled and became
painful. Holten put a foam dressing in the hole then used a thin
plastic film to seal the area. Then, using the vacuum pump, which
was attached to a tube embedded in the foam, he sucked off the
fluid.
Next, Holten wants to test the technique on a patient whose leg
has ulcerated from toe to knee after being bitten by Australia's
venomous white-tailed spider.
But Ken Winkel from the Australian Venom Research Unit at the
University of Melbourne says it is far too early to know if the
technique will become a commonplace way to deal with the effects of
bites.
Matsushita and its rivals Sony and TDK have been developing
metal-evaporated tape for 20 years, but it has only been used for
broadcast-quality digital recording because it is so expensive. ME
tape is very thin, allowing more video to be stored in a small
cassette. But this makes it inefficient for recording analogue
signals, which require a thick magnetic layer to capture low
frequencies.
The latest consumer video format, digital video, records both
sound and vision as high-frequency digital code, which can be
faithfully captured in a very thin magnetic coating.
Matsushita thinks DV users will pay a premium for cassettes that
increase recording time from 80 to 120 minutes.
Previous ME tapes have needed a backing 7 micrometers thick to
withstand the strain of traveling through a video recorder. This
has limited tape length in the cassette to 80 minutes. With the DLC
backing, Matsushita can make do with 4.8 micrometres, creating tape
which is only 5.5 micrometres thick in total.
