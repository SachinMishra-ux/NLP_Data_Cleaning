A tobacco industry lobbyist said the TV, radio and newspaper ad
campaign will likely continue as the House considers legislation
and possibly into the election period to help boost lawmakers who
opposed the McCain bill.
While the tobacco executives dodged a sizeable financial hit
with the death of the McCain bill, they still must deal with the
numerous state lawsuits that would have been settled by the McCain
bill.
The tobacco industry has already reached settlements with
Minnesota, Texas, Florida and Mississippi for a total of $36.5
billion in damages. The death of the Senate bill will not affect
those payments.
Republicans leaders say they do not believe the tobacco issue
will resonate with voters in the fall.
But a recent poll by the independent Pew Research Center found
that by 62 percent to 29 percent the public favors the government
taking some sort of action against the tobacco companies.
Poll director Andrew Kohut said that the Democratic argument
that the GOP is tied to the tobacco industry could hurt Republicans
because it confirms voter suspicion that the party is beholden to
big business.
However, Kohut said that support for action against tobacco
companies tends to decline somewhat when specifics, such as raising
taxes, are mentioned.
GOP pollster Bill McInturff said that while the McCain bill was
probably too big and complex, Republicans would be misreading
public sentiment if they believed the public opposed doing
something about tobacco.
WASHINGTON The Clinton administration on Thursday mounted its
most detailed defense of its satellite export control policy, as
three top officials said that China's military had not benefited
from transfers of sensitive American technology and that safeguards
were in place to prevent any such leakage.
The spirited rebuttals by senior officials from the departments
of Commerce, State and Defense marked a counteroffensive against a
growing Republican-led attack on the administration's handling of
satellite exports to China, a policy that Republicans have charged
threatens American national security.
