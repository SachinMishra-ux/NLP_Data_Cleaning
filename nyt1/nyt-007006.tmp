WASHINGTON President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke as
ambassador to the United Nations Thursday, to energize the US
foreign policy team as crises loom in Asia, the Balkans and the
Middle East.
Clinton chose Holbrooke, a hard-charging diplomat and investment
banker, because the United States is struggling to reform the
United Nations while prodding allies to take tougher approaches
against pariah countries such as Iraq. At the same time, the
administration wanted a forceful advocate to urge Congress to pay
back dues of more than $1 billion to the UN.
Holbrooke has openly campaigned for a high-level job foreign
policy job in the administration for two years. Officials who
followed the decision-making said the traits that initially hurt
him including an oversized ego and a reputation for stirring
things up worked to his advantage this time.
The ascension of Holbrooke, a friend of both Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore, comes as the administration tries to recover
from several foreign policy setbacks. The Middle East process is
stalled, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's top advisers
fear a resurgence of terrorism against Israelis. Nuclear tests by
India in May caught the United States by surprise, despite what had
been regarded as a close relationship with the government in New
Delhi.
At the UN, the administration is frustrated by European
governments' reluctance to impose harsh sanctions on Iraq. And many
of Clinton's advisers agree with Holbrooke's assertion that ethnic
fighting in the Kosovo province of Serbia will spill out to
neighboring countries unless the West quells the violence soon.
In a meeting with India's new government this spring, Richardson
reportedly spent little time talking about the prospect of nuclear
tests and said the United States wanted to broaden its
relationship. Just a few weeks later, India conducted five atomic
blasts.
US officials disagreed about exactly what Richardson had said
during his private meetings in New Delhi, and several said the
State Department had unfairly blamed him for failing to send clear
signals to India.
The officials said that in 1996, Albright resisted suggestions
that Holbrooke serve at the UN because of his reputation for
working on his own and bucking his superiors. But after a year and
a half as Secretary of State, Albright apparently feels comfortable
enough to share the limelight.
Since John F. Kennedy appointed Adlai Stevenson ambassador to
the UN in 1961, most political appointees in the post have been
made members of the Cabinet. Although in theory they report to the
secretary of state, they sit at Cabinet meetings and give their own
recommendations on policy.
As a diplomat, Holbrooke has been involved in major events from
the Paris Peace Talks that ended the Vietnam war to the Dayton
talks that brought a fragile peace to Bosnia. Currently the vice
president of Credit Suisse First Boston, he served as a young
diplomat under then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, worked as a
Peace Corps country director in Morocco, assistant secretary of
State for Asia and ambassador to Germany.
