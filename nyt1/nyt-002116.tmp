However, Western seismologists are investigating the possibility
that the Indians and Pakistanis successfully detonated fewer bombs
than claimed, according to Thorne Lay of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, an adviser to the U.S. government on
monitoring of nuclear tests.
Lay said some explosions may have fallen short of critical mass.
In a normal atomic bomb, the fissionable material is compressed
extremely quickly into a super-dense state called critical mass.
This unleashes a flood of subatomic particles called neutrons,
which split enough atoms fast enough to trigger an atomic
explosion.
In 1945, an atomic bomb incinerated Hiroshima with an explosive
force of 14,000 tons of TNT. By contrast, a subcritical explosion
might equal 10 to 20 tons of TNT, the nuclear version of a wet
firecracker.
One possible explanation, Lay said, is that the Indians and
Pakistanis might have detonated some bombs simultaneously. This
might have made it difficult for Western seismologists to assess
the true magnitude of individual blasts.
Another possibility is that the Indians and Pakistanis may have
deliberately conducted subcritical blasts to test parts of nuclear
devices, rather than full-fledged bombs.
However, Lay said, it would be hard to reconcile this with the
fact that India and Pakistan have referred to all the blasts as
nuclear explosions.
Other U.S. officials and test-monitoring experts confirmed that
seismographs failed to detect proof that all 11 blasts occurred as
claimed.
Cochran recalled seeing a photo of a surface crater formed by
one of India's explosions. The crater looked unusually small for
something allegedly generated by a nuclear blast of the advertised
size, he said.
Cochran said certainly one possibility is that Indian and
Pakistani officials overstated the size of the blasts. Another
possibility is that some tests were conducted in geological terrain
that might have muffled the blasts.
