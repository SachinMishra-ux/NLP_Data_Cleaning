But even as people expect him to be confirmed by the Senate, no
one expects that process to occur without its own drama. As U.N.
ambassador, Richardson played an intriguing, perhaps significant,
role in the Monica Lewinsky story and he would likely be questioned
about it at any confirmation hearing.
Ms. Lewinsky is the former White House intern who is at the
center of the current investigation by Whitewater prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, of Clinton. Starr is investigating whether the
president had an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, lied
about it under oath and encouraged her to conceal it as well.
When Ms. Lewinsky was leaving a job at the public affairs office
at the Pentagon last fall, Richardson met with her in his official
suite at the Watergate apartments to discuss a possible job for her
the U.S. mission at the United Nations. He offered her a job which
she declined in favor of a corporate post in New York.
Investigators are trying to find out if the job offer from
Richardson was part of an inducement for Ms. Lewinsky not to say
anything damaging about the president.
William Blaine Richardson was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Nov.
15, 1947, and graduated from the Middlesex School and Tufts
University, both in Massachusetts. As a young man, he was
considered a major-league pitching prospect. He and his wife,
Barbara, who have no children, live in the Waldorf-Astoria
apartment provided for U.N. ambassadors.
In one of his most celebrated missions, Richardson successfully
negotiated the release of three Westerners including a U.S. pilot
in the middle of the Sudanese desert. He persuaded the rebel
leaders to drop their demand for millions of dollars in exchange
for tons of food along with jeeps and radios.
As Washington's U.N. ambassador, Richardson compiled what
diplomats have viewed as an impressive list of achievements,
including persuading the new leader of Congo to allow an
investigation of human rights abuses and as a principal advocate of
a tough U.S. policy towards Iraq.
He recently has been criticized by some diplomats for failing to
perceive, during a visit to New Delhi, India's intentions to engage
in nuclear testing.
In May, Richardson became the first U.S. Cabinet official to
visit Afghanistan in more than two decades and obtained an
agreement from the warring factions to begin peace talks, and he
was Clinton's choice to try to ease the dying leader of Zaire,
Mobutu Sese Seko, out of office.
Richardson was regarded warmly at the United Nations, especially
among the diplomats of the developing world who are often ignored
by U.S. officials, for his backslapping, informal nature and his
political skills. He made much of his part-Hispanic background and
liked socializing with delegates.
