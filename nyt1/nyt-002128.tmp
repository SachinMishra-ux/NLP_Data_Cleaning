Vaiden has long since given up trying to change his sexual
orientation. That's not to say he didn't struggle to remain with
his wife and attempt to be straight.
Vaiden thought he could cure his homosexuality through prayer
and Scripture. But such efforts proved futile. He tried to balance
his sexual desires with his need to take care of his wife and
family.
It all became too much. Vaiden divorced. A year later he and
Fleming began living together, a partnership that has lasted for 15
years.
Despite Asian tremors, stock market jitters and fears that
America is running out of workers, the economy is still booming. In
May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, employers added
nearly 300,000 new jobs, unemployment held steady at an almost
unbelievably low 4.3 percent the lowest rate in 28 years and
pay continued to rise.
Investors focused on the optimistic side, reasoning that such a
show of economic strength bodes well for corporate profits. The
stock market, which had been faltering lately, surged in a powerful
rally that pushed the Dow Jones average up nearly 2 percent, its
best gain in four months.
The May jobs figures are only the latest evidence that the
economy remains far more robust than most experts expected.
Spending on everything from new homes and cars to business
equipment has been soaring in recent weeks.
Indeed, the surge in hiring surprised economists who were
expecting the unemployment rate to tick up in May and payrolls to
only rise modestly. What's more, the Labor Department reported that
the job market was stronger in March and April than previously
reported.
The best labor market since the go-go 1960s is a boon for most
Americans who are now enjoying signing bonuses, more frequent
raises and, not least, the luxury of choice. The quit rate the
best measure of how confident workers are that they trade their old
job for a better one has been hovering close its highest level
since the beginning the economic expansion seven years ago.
Although a tight labor market also increases the possibility
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the
economy down, wage inflation is hardly surging. Hourly earnings are
now 4.3 percent above their year-ago level. After rising 5 cents in
April, earnings edged up another 4 cents to $12.73.
The sole weak spot in the job market is in industry. Asia's
problems have been hitting American exporters hard since the
beginning of the year, contributing to a big buildup in inventories
and production cutbacks.
