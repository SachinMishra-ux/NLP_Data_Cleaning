Cooking teacher and cookbook author Steven Raichlen spent three
years traveling the globe exploring the wide world of barbecue
culture for his much anticipated Barbecue Bible (Workman).
This month you can find Raichlen's Greek-inspired recipes for
Grill-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Lemon Butter, Greek-Style Garlic and
Lemon Roasted Potatoes and Swordfish Souvlaki on the Internet at

I've noticed several trend trackers hailing Brazilian barbecue
(known in that country as churrasco) as the next hot food trend
coming down the pike. If a recent family vacation to Denver is any
indication, it's already starting to happen.
Three Rodizio (pronounced ho-dee-zee-oh) restaurants are
thriving. On two nights I enjoyed the full-blown meal, a staggering
variety of meats from a skewer including picanha (a
Brazilian-style beef filet), lamb, fish and delectable nibbles of
bacon-wrapped turkey.
A $15.95 per person price tag included gaucho-clad waiters and a
staggering self-serve salad bar with such exotic goodies as fresh
buffalo mozzarella, quail's eggs and feijoada, a black-bean stew.
But formal documents show that state officials had known the
takeover would result in millions of dollars in benefits to Lilco
executives, even if the exact amount was not specified. The records
include Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Lilco's
takeover agreement, its agreement to merge with Brooklyn Union Gas
and correspondence from the Long Island Power Authority, the state
agency that negotiated the takeover.
The dispute has clouded the governor's triumph in revamping Long
Island's electricity service at long last and delivering a 20
percent cut in what, under Lilco, had been the highest bills in the
continental United States.
The payouts, which also included $25 million to 25 other top
Lilco executives, bolstered the central argument of takeover
opponents, who contend that the $7 billion deal was a giveaway to
Lilco that burdens electricity customers with debt. The critics
charge that Pataki and his aides purposely ignored the compensation
issue for fear it would jeopardize the takeover.
Pataki has ordered the state attorney general and the Public
Service Commission to investigate the payouts and demanded that the
former Lilco chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, return the money
and quit as chairman of Lilco's successor, Marketspan. The power
authority, which hired Marketspan to run the old Lilco system, is
withholding $1 million a month and imposing other penalties, and
the state Assembly has set a hearing on the matter for Tuesday.
Pataki and his power authority chairman, Richard Kessel, insist
that the payouts were surreptitious and violated the takeover and
merger pacts. They contend that Lilco executives were not entitled
to severance payments because they all automatically got new jobs
at Marketspan and never lost a day's pay.
