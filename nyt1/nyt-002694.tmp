She was the chief witness against her boyfriend, who was on
trial on a misdemeanor charge of punching her in January. Like many
women in similar positions, she did not want to testify. The judge
jailed her to make sure she took the stand.
Martinez's case represents a trend that victims and defense
attorneys say has become all too common since the O.J. Simpson
case: In an effort to crack down on domestic violence, prosecutors
and judges are getting increasingly aggressive with victims who
refuse to testify or change their stories.
These women may find themselves threatened with prosecution for
filing a false police report. If they insist the original story
they gave police was a lie, then they are told they are guilty of a
crime.
And sometimes, albeit it rarely, women wind up in custody to
make sure they take the stand at trial. A woman who misses a court
appearance might find police at her doorstep with a pair of
handcuffs and a warrant.
Municipal Court Judge Roy M. Carstairs jailed Martinez because
he said her refusal to testify voluntarily would have sabotaged the
trial.
Prosecutors say such tactics are designed to give victims as
little control as possible over the outcome of a domestic violence
case. That way the accused abuser can't wiggle out of a criminal
charge by intimidating his spouse or promising her he'll change.
Bloomquist said her office requests body attachment in less than
5 percent of all cases, and only when the woman makes clear she
won't come voluntarily.
Critics find such tactics distasteful and paternalistic. They
accuse prosecutors of assuming every victim who tries to recant is
too fearful or weak to decide what's in her own best interest. In
no other type of crime, they argue, would the victim have so little
control over how a case is handled.
And defense lawyers argue that such tactics prevent women from
changing the stories they initially told police even when those
stories were heat-of-the-moment exaggerations or outright lies.
Deputy Public Defender Bill Weiss, who heads the Van Nuys office
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, said one prosecutor routinely
would take the recanting witness into a small room and threaten her
with immediate arrest for filing false police reports. Weiss said
he learned about the practice after several women complained to
lawyers in his office.
