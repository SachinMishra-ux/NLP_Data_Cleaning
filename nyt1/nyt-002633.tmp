Shays says that he has more than 200 votes and that he and
Meehan are trying to woo as many as 60 undecided lawmakers.
Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., who is the House minority leader, is
also trying to unite Democrats around Shays's legislation. His vote
counters say the Democratic holdouts are, for the most part, either
minority lawmakers concerned about get-out-the-vote drives or
anti-abortion Democrats who have been swayed by the National Right
to Life Committee, which fiercely opposes spending and advertising
restrictions.
Republians face a different choice: whether to split with their
party and join forces with the small group of Republicans who want
to change Washington politics. Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., who favors
overhaul, predicted that more of his colleagues than expected might
do so rather than cast an election-year vote to stop change.
BOSTON Forget about giving Mike Piazza a bat and Pedro
Martinez a baseball to settle their continuing dispute about
Martinez's inside fastball that plunked Piazza in the left hand on
Friday night.
Just rent out Madison Square Garden, hand each player a
microphone and let Vince McMahon be the promoter. This verbal
skirmish about whether Martinez intended to hit Piazza has all the
earmarks of professional wrestling.
The fierce animosity between Piazza and Martinez escalated
Sunday after Piazza, the Mets' catcher, chastised Martinez, the Red
Sox pitcher, for lacking decorum in uttering two expletives in
reference to him in an interview for Sunday's Boston Herald. A
perturbed Martinez countered by insisting that he has more class
than Piazza, who comes from a wealthy background.
Martinez fired back with words as biting as one of his chin-high
fastballs and made reference to Piazza's perennially hefty bank
account.
Piazza, who has been out of the lineup since suffering the
bruised hand and was not scheduled to start Sunday night, accused
Martinez of trying to obscure the fact that he cursed in an
interview to be published in a paper that children might read.
Martinez agreed that expletives are not proper language for
publication.
It is hard to imagine that Piazza and Martinez were teammates
with the Dodgers for part of 1992 and all of 1993. After Martinez
hit Piazza with a 2-2 pitch and first base open in the first inning
on Friday, Piazza intimated strongly that he had been a target.
The innuendo bothered Martinez, who is notorious for throwing
inside at hitters and does not dispute the reputation.
