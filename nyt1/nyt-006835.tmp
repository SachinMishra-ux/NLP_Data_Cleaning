First off, what should I do? Second, who's Sylvia Plath? I
checked everywhere, even the cut-out bins at the CD store, and
can't find anything by her.
DEAR RANDY: There is nothing the Answer Man enjoys more than the
romantic entanglements of the immature, self-centered, puerile and
near-illiterate. He has, in fact, considered devoting an entire
column to just this subject, but grew despondent and near-suicidal
when faced with the prospect that there are readers out there who
might actually enjoy reading it.
Failing this, the Answer Man has always found the combination of
a boss muscle car and painful genital self-piercings to be
well-nigh irresistible.
As for Ms. Plath, simply ride out this phase. One can't wear
black for too awfully long without tiring of it. As you might
suggest yourself: Just go do it, dude!
DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: My mother-in-law doesn't like me.
She thinks I am a shrew and a harpie who married her son for his
looks. I love my husband dearly, but he is 75 pounds overweight,
refuses to wash his hair more than once a week and suffers
near-constant, oozing cold sores on his lips.
How do I know my mother-in-law feels this way? She told me. She
lives with us, complicating matters further. My husband refuses to
take sides, and I'm at my wit's end. You're my last resort. Help! Pulling Out My Hair 
DEAR HAIR: Ah, love is such a fragile gift. Call me
old-fashioned, but I gravitate toward the simple approach. Simply
tell your mother-in-law that you married her son for his money.
Then suggest that she might be more comfortable sleeping in the
cellar or the small closet beneath the stairs. The truth is always
best!
DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: Settle a bet between my brother and
me. I say watching Roseanne talk while munching on a loose-meat
sandwich would be more disgusting than watching Robin Williams
shave his back; my brother says I'm wrong. A steak dinner is riding
on your answer! Manny in Montana 
DEAR MONTANA: Alas, looks like Dutch treat for you two siblings I'll go with Bill Clinton wrestling Ken Starr in Speedos. Bon
apetit!
DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: We recently adopted an adorable pit
bull-Rottweiler mix. Naturally, he is rambunctious he's already
killed three neighborhood cats (he brings them home and leaves them
on the doorstep like gifts, the little dear), and has bitten off
the tips of two of my fingers.
