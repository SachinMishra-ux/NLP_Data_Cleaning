When Havrum died six years ago at the Truman Memorial Veterans
Hospital in Columbia, Mo., at age 66, his wife assumed the cause
was natural.
Next month, the 71-year-old widow, who has never set foot in a
courtroom, puts the United States on trial in a wrongful death
lawsuit that alleges negligence and malpractice at the
government-owned hospital. She seeks unspecified damages.
Helen Havrum claims her husband died at the hands of a nurse the
FBI investigated but never charged in 33 suspicious deaths at the
hospital. Havrum alleges a codeine overdose killed her husband.
The government wanted the 1995 lawsuit dismissed, saying Havrum
lacks evidence and waited too long to file. But U.S. District Judge
Nanette K. Laughrey of Kansas City denied the motion Friday.
The Havrum trial will be the fullest public exploration of any
of the 33 suspicious deaths, said Gordon Christensen, a doctor at
the veterans' hospital who called public attention to the series of
deaths in 1992.
Relatives of one other veteran filed a lawsuit in St. Louis, but
a judge dismissed it last year, saying it missed the statute of
limitations deadline.
Patients were 10 times more likely to die while nurse Richard A.
Williams was on duty, according to an analysis by Christensen. No
similar pattern emerged for other nurses or medical personnel at
the hospital, he found.
Of the 55 persons who died in the ward between March 8 and Aug.
22, 1992, 45 died while Williams was on duty, hospital records
show.
In the lawsuit, Havrum faults the hospital for hiring Williams
after he had been fired from a job in Springfield, Mo., for failing
to give prescribed medicine and falsifying records.
Further, Havrum said the hospital was negligent to keep Williams
on duty after more than 30 patients died unexpectedly on his watch
between March and June of 1992.
