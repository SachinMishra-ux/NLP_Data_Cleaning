Lehman's 68 tied him for the low round of the day, and it began
almost as incredibly, as he ran in three straight birdies. Too bad
for him they were followed by three straight bogeys.
Tway hung on all day, absorbing three bogeys and a double. But
he managed to sink a 3-foot birdie at the 18th for a 73 that kept
him within striking distance.
Two other big hitters, Nick Price (71) and Lee Janzen (73), who
edged Stewart in the 1993 Open at Baltusrol, also were right there.
But it might be a reach for Steve Stricker (69) and Jeff Maggert
(75), who trailed by 6 strokes.
Pre-tournament favorites Tiger Woods (71, 7 over), David Duval
(75, 8 over) and defending champ Ernie Els (75, 10 over) are out of
the chase. Along with Casey Martin (74, 9 over), they have early
tee times today.
Maybe it will be the difference for Lehman, who has finished
third, second and third the past three years while waiting to play
late in the day in the Eastern time zone in New York (Shinnecock),
Michigan (Oakland Hills) and Washington, D.C. (Congressional). 
SAN FRANCISCO It won't be the knickers. It won't be the cart.
It won't be the expletives directed at pin placement or a bunch of
whiny golfers commiserating about the course. The enduring symbol
of the U.S. Open and maybe the entire season will be the smile.
It started in Georgia, bigger than Mark O'Meara's green jacket.
It has stretched all the way to California, brighter than Payne
Stewart's wardrobe. And it belongs to an amateur who is baffling
experts with his poise, melting galleries with his grin.
The look of a teen who just scored a fake ID and front-row
tickets for Megadeth.
Matt Kuchar turns 20 today, and already he is teaching his
peers. If everyone could loosen up and enjoy himself like this kid,
well, golf wouldn't desperately need a visit from the fun police.
So the fantasy exploded Saturday afternoon, a string of bogeys
that spiked Kuchar's chances of becoming the first amateur in 65
years to win the Open. Doesn't matter because through it all, the
smile remained. It was contagious and emerged after every shot. And
when he approached the 18th green, the gallery gave him a standing
ovation.
