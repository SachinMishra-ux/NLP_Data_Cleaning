But the Yankees manage to find a way, from all corners of their
lineup. With the Yankees down by 1-0, Paul O'Neill opened the
fourth inning with a single. Martinez then pulled a grounder past
first baseman Jim Thome into the right-field corner. Manny Ramirez,
Cleveland's right fielder, fumbled with the ball a bit before
relaying it back to the infield, and O'Neill who appeared to slow
after rounding second scored just ahead of the throw. For
Martinez, it was his first double since May 15, four days before he
was hit by Benitez.
Tim Raines then grounded to second, with Martinez taking third.
Darryl Strawberry, starting his third consecutive game, slammed a
high drive to right field, where Ramirez backed against the wall,
reached up and gloved the ball only to bounce against the fence
and lose control of the ball. Martinez scored easily, and
Strawberry pulled into second with a double,
Strawberry appeared to be limping heavily as he rounded first
and pulled into second. Although he has 10 home runs and produces
runs when he plays, Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, has been
reluctant to use Strawberry on a regular basis to protect his
surgically repaired left knee.
In the fifth inning, Scott Brosius led off against Cleveland
starter Dave Burba (8-5) by hitting a high fastball it into the
stands in left-center field, an estimated 419 feet. It was the
seventh homer of the season for Brosius.
One out later, Chuck Knoblauch walked and took second when Derek
Jeter reached base on an error by Thome. O'Neill then pulled a
single through the right side of the infield, and Knoblauch raced
home, giving the Yankees a 4-1 lead.
The Yankees' defense has been exceptional all season, and an
errant throw by Jeter in the third inning was the first error by a
Yankees shortstop this season, and only the third error of the year
by Jeter. Before allowing an unearned run Friday, the Yankees'
defense had allowed only one in the previous 185 innings.
The defense helped Wells get through an eighth-inning jam. David
Bell singled to right-center, where Chad Curtis hustled over to
retrieve the ball, and after Bell thought about trying for second
and then fell down stopping, the Yankees nabbed him in a rundown.
Curtis ran down a fly from Kenny Lofton in left-center for the
second out. The Indians scored a single run in the inning, cutting
the Yankees' edge to 4-2.
Mike Stanton, who is appealing the five-game suspension handed
down this week by American League President Gene Budig, thought his
appeal would be heard on Monday. In fact, his hearing has not been
scheduled, and according to a league official, it will not occur
Monday. If Stanton begins to serve the suspension on Wednesday, as
scheduled, then he will miss two games against the Atlanta Braves
and all three games of the interleague series with the Mets.
Della Rocca was instrumental in the revival of what is now known
as Community Mayors of New York and New Jersey and served as its
director. An all-volunteer group based in Brooklyn, it organizes
recreational trips and shows for children and adults with special
needs. Typical events have been visits to Coney Island, the circus
in Manhattan, the New York Aquarium, and the Bronx Zoo.
More recently, he helped create a summer camp for blind children
in Suffern, N.Y., known as Camp Montebello.
