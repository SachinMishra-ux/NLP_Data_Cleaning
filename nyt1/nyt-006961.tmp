The fifth summer on the Chesapeake came to an end with a sail
back into Annapolis. We didn't run aground, didn't get hit by a
freighter hauling televisions from Japan, didn't get lost in the
fog. Nobody fell overboard and we weren't set adrift by an anchor
coming loose in the night. We've become such experienced sailors
that once terrifying vacations are ho-hum. Next year we may try
something different, like an ox-cart trip across the Rockies.
WACO, Texas I just realized I should stop pretending I was
somebody else and start being like Mike, which is bald.
I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work.
I realized the futility of this exercise the morning after
Michael Jordan won his sixth NBA title, his teammates hugging his
neck like superfluous follicles.
I thought to myself: Here is this man the world adores, the
epitome of grace, style and merchandizing, and he's got nothing on
his head but Air.
And look at heads around the league, and look at the leagues
below, the colleges, the high schools, the junior high leagues.
There's more skin there than Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition,
which has less and less suit every year.
And we're not just talking about black guys. During the playoffs
the Indiana Pacers, in an apparent team initiative to make coach
Larry Byrd look prettier than John Tesh, all shaved their heads.
Now, head-shaved, seven-footer Rick Smits is no Yul Brynner.
Indeed, if Brynner had a backyard hound, the sight of Smits would
have caused it to lose its skin. But if that guy can parade lobar
nudity with pride, so can the rest of us. The fact is, we know we
can because Mike does.
Yes, this is about Michael Jordan. Just ask NBC. He's next to
God and bigger than the Beatles.
As hairlessness sweeps the land, we must wonder about economic
hardships, all those hair cuts, and who's making a mint off the
little man. In Waco, this trend could vault the local barber into
the income bracket occupied only by the local allergist.
That's why I'm the one next to make a mint. I've applied for a
patent on a new hair-loss drug no, not to restore hair, to lose
it. Pending FDA approval, I think the trademark I've secured,
Nogaine, is a winner.
