 P SAN FRANCISCO Q The Olympic Club added to its U.S. Open
legacy yesterday
when another 54-hole leader stumbled down the stretch and lost the
tournament. P For those counting at home, the course is now
four-for-four in producing
dramatic, comeback winners at the Open. The latest to fall, Payne
Stewart, added his name to a list that also includes Ben Hogan
(1955), Arnold Palmer (1966) and Tom Watson (1987). All were reeled
in at Olympic by players with fewer career victories on the PGA
Tour. P RIUd say the golf course won. The golf course lived up to
its reputation,S
Stewart said after flushing a four-stroke lead in the final round
and losing by a stroke to Lee Janzen. P Stewart joined Tom Lehman,
his final-round playing partner, as the two
sympathetic characters in the latest Olympic melodrama. P Unable
to control his driver down the stretch, Stewart hit his fewest
number of fairways (six) and greens in regulation (nine) of any
round during Open week while ballooning to a 74. Lehman, a
sentimental favorite who was playing in the final group at the Open
for a fourth consecutive year, fell short once again in his Open
quest with a closing 75. P RI said [Saturday] that if I played the
type of game Payne Stewart can
play, IUd be standing here with the trophy. And I didnUt do that,S
Stewart said. RPlus, Lee Janzen shot 68 on a day when nobody else
in contention could break par. He deserves to win. P RIUm
disappointed. But this isnUt going to change my life. I didnUt play
well enough to win. ItUs as simple as that. And it wonUt take me
very long at all to get over this. IUll still be able to sleep
tonight.S P Lehman indicated he may be missing a few winks for the
foreseeable future
because he was Rirritated with myselfS after falling short in the
Open for a fourth consecutive year. The failed 54-hole leader at
the past three Opens, Lehman began yesterdayUs final round four
strokes in back of Stewart and never made a birdie. P He placed
fifth, which comes on the heels of finishes of third (1995),
second (1996) and third (1997). P By his calculations, Lehman
never gave himself a decent birdie chance until
the 11th hole. Then, he failed to capitalize on three in a row. P RBy the time I made bogey on 14, I knew I was history,S Lehman
said. RFor
the last two days, IUve had the hardest time reading the greens. I
could never tell if we were going uphill or downhill. Therefore, I
never came close to making one.S P Lehman left the course
displaying a unique mix of iron-willed determination
and heart-tugging frustration. P RIf I can keep playing this well
in this tournament for the next four or
five years, I think IUm going to win one. Or two, or three or
four,S Lehman said. RBut the last thing I want to do right now is
play golf. This is a big tournament and IUm disappointed. IUm a
little bit irritated with myself. ItUs very frustrating to go
through this again, IUll be honest with you.S
 A: A number of states such as Colorado and New Hampshire have
laws prohibiting discrimination against people for lawful
activities such as smoking.
But California isn't one so those two firms did have a right
to reject you for being a smoker.
Companies have a lot of leeway in deciding whom to hire as long
as they don't discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion,
age, sexual orientation or disability. Ideally, firms base their
hiring decisions on things like competence or credentials. But
other subjective factors often come into play, too from the
personal rapport that a candidate establishes with the boss to a
candidate's appearance or mannerisms.
It's certainly harder to be a smoker in the workplace today.
California law bans smoking in workplaces with five people or more.
Some places like North Miami, Fla., have even passed laws barring
smokers from working for city government, in an effort to improve
employees' health and cut insurance costs.
You should take a hard look at whether smoking was the real
reason you didn't get those jobs. Maybe something else in your
attitude or background turned the companies off, and they were
using smoking as an excuse.
Or maybe you really do need to deal with an odor problem because
of your smoking.
 Q: My company recently adopted a new rule saying that if you
take time off, it must be a minimum of four hours. There are times
when I need just one or two hours off for personal business, but
they say I must take a full four hours. They say this new system is
easier for the timekeeper. Don't we as employees have a right to
take off small amounts of time?
 A: Companies must pay their workers for all the time they
actually put in. So if you took two hours off and the company
docked your pay as if you'd taken four hours off, that would be
illegal. You could file a complaint with the California Labor
Commissioner, at (415) 557-7878.
But that doesn't sound like the case here. The company is
docking you four hours' pay, but it's also telling you to take off
the full four hours. So you don't have a legal claim for unpaid
wages.
