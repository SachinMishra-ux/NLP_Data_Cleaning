Two girls his age walked by, looked at his Tupac shirt and
giggled. They were wearing Bermudas and blouses in Muffy-Buffy
plaids. Hey, who's wearing the funny clothes here?
Tiger unites all, though. As he approached the 14th hole, the
kid in the Tupac shirt began chatting with an older man in a blue
blazer and Panama hat.
John Daly, what a guy. He looks like John Candy's younger,
meaner brother. He hits long, lives large and is my kind of
athletic role model. A Kaiser roll model.
I was waiting along the first fairway for Tiger when Daly's ball
landed nearby. He leaned on his club and lit up a ciggy. When it
was time to hit, he crushed it on the fairway. His caddy picked up
the butt.
Those are the kinds of details you see watching golf in person
that you'll never see on television.
Oh, the power of this sport. The player in question put his
glove back on, leading to follow-up glove analysis.
Some advice if you're going on safari with Tiger this weekend.
Just do it briefly. It's great to see him up close, but you only
see parts of him between heads, under visors and around carefully
bobbed hair.
There has to be more to watching golf than that. Don't ask me. I
only saw Tiger once close up, and never did see him sink a putt. I
assume he did.
Need I say Woods? Need I say the most famous sports hero in the
world, even for those who don't quite consider golf a sport?
The only break you get from hearing his name is when the
marshals hush the crowd before a shot, and thank God for that bit
of etiquette.
