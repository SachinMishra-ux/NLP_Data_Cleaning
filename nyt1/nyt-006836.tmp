My wife lives in constant fear that little Cupcake will
eventually attack our pet python or eat our collection of scorpions
and tarantulas. Our twin sons, now 6, have had the snake as a pet

Obviously you have a special animal on your hands. I'll be
blunt: You need a larger home. Doubtless, this may seem like a
large investment now, but think of the rewards this little dear
will offer you in the long run!
It's true. There are people who really want to be the voices
answering the phone numbers that consumers or co-workers call when
their computers crash or when they can't figure out the tax code,
hook up that printer or get the dishwasher to scrub pots.
It is no easy job. Personnel at help desks, after all, must
soothe angry customers and solve their problems and then do it
again, maybe 100 times a day, five days a week. They must
understand all the technical details in a user's manual, yet
explain them in layman's terms.
They must be endlessly patient and polite, even when the caller
is neither. And they must do so in an atmosphere in which their
comings and goings, down to essentials like toilet breaks, are
often rigidly controlled.
Such diligent souls are certainly in demand. Personal computers
are ubiquitous. New and often bug-ridden software floods the
market. Complex technology pervades cars, televisions and other
items that were once relatively easy to understand.
Even so, the work does not pay particularly well. Starting
salaries rarely top $30,000 not much for people who often are
middle-aged or college-educated. But as time and expertise accrue,
help desk workers are often promoted to higher levels, at which
they spend less time on the phone and more doing research into
problems. In a few high-technology companies, such support staff
make as much as $100,000.
The demand is overtaxing the supply. For every help desk
employee who regards the job as a career choice, several more are
just trying to scrape together some extra dollars until a better
position opens up.
Some offer months of training and extensive mentoring; others
coach people for a few hours and send them to the phones. Some say
a college degree should be required, some call it irrelevant and
still others contend it is a drawback.
Many help desks now offer frequent raises, bonuses and paid time
off. Many let staff members break from the phones for a few hours
each day to answer e-mail queries or review product literature. And
many now have communications programs, complete with newsletters
and company outings, as well as career-planning sessions.
