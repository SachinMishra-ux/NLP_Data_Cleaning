NEW YORK Sales are expected to restart next month at Turtle
Bay Towers, putting the 337-unit co-op at 310 East 46th St. back in
the market for the first time in a decade.
The plan reached by the co-op board and Rockrose Development
Corp., the sponsor is to improve the 26-story structure and sell
the 245 unsold apartments, many with terraces and greenhouses.
Prices are expected to range from $135,000 to $400,000 for the
studio lofts and one- and two-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,600
square feet. Those prices, on average, are about 5 percent to 10
percent higher than what the units sold for in 1988, when they
originally went on the market.
Market-rate mortgages will also be available to buyers through
American Home Mortgage, overcoming a financing difficulty often
faced by purchasers in buildings where fewer than 51 percent of the
units have been sold. About 95 units are expected to come on the
market this year, starting with as many as 18 next month.
The wedding-cake-style structure, between First and Second
avenues, was converted in 1988 from a rental that Rockrose had
reshaped 13 years earlier from a 1929 office and a light-industrial
loft building that had been damaged by a natural-gas explosion in
1973.
Only 28 percent of the apartments were sold before the recession
hit and the market soured, as did the relationship between the
co-op board and Rockrose, whose headquarters are in the building's
ground-level commercial space.
There are 68 apartments that are leased to rent-stabilized
tenants, who are allowed to remain in their units at regulated
rents. An additional 177 apartments that are also owned by Rockrose
are rented to tenants who replaced residents who had been living in
the building when it became a co-op.
Tenants in these apartments are not protected by rent
regulations, and the market rents that they pay had given Rockrose
little incentive to sell their units because the rents exceeded the
monthly maintenance charges.
Last fall, Rockrose and the co-op board, encouraged by
Manhattan's strong sales market, set their sights on the same goal:
selling the unsold units. After seven months of negotiations, they
devised a refinancing and buildingwide renovation program to make
the building more attractive.
The building's $25 million mortgage was refinanced at a lower
interest rate in April after Rockrose, which held the mortgage,
agreed to waive all but $500,000 of an $11 million prepayment
penalty. The new $30 million loan is at a fixed interest rate of
6.63 percent for 20 years instead of the original 10.53 percent,
said Andrew Singer, chairman of Singer Bassuk Organization, which
arranged the financing for the co-op. The lender was PruExpress, a
subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which is based
in Newark, N.J.
