In an impromptu skins game, Martin fleeced Woods out of $30. On
Thursday, despite a late tee time that had him shivering in the
dark, he played with incredible poise. Despite bogeying the last
two holes, he is in good position to make the cut.
On the subject of playing in the dark, there is still a faction
opposed to Martin. By deposition, Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer
testified against him. And Tom Watson had a chilling response when
asked how he'd feel if his son was in the same position.
Whatever, Tom. But for all the talk of golf being a physical
activity, know Martin had to walk from approach shot to green, then
on to the next tee. That's about 60 yards per hole, and given
Martin's disease, I'd call that a wash.
Yet once the sun had disappeared, there were no tire tracks, no
dilemmas, no controversy surrounding his cart. Just a man who never
gave up showing us the reason why. Dan Bickley can be reached at dan.bickley(at)pni.com.
State tribal negotiators reached a truce Thursday in the state
poker wars, just 18 hours before Casino Arizona was set to open on
the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Community, east of Scottsdale.
After months of declaring that the state has no authority over
Indian-run poker, Ivan Makil, tribal president, agreed to hire the
state Gaming Department to oversee and monitor its 42-table poker
room at McKellips Road just east of the Pima Freeway.
In exchange, Gov. Jane Hull will not take the tribe the court to
resolve the poker issue, which erupted in August after state
Attorney General Grant Woods said that Indian-run card games are
illegal in Arizona.
Details of the pact have not been worked out, but it means that
Casino Arizona, which opens Friday, will continue to run its poker
hall while negotiations continue between Hull and tribal officials.
Without the agreement, the casino's continued operation may have
been in jeopardy.
Gary Husk, head of the Arizona Gaming Department, said his
concerns over hiring practices at the casino prove the state should
regulate poker just as it does slot machines and other games in
Indian country.
He said he is worried about the integrity of poker at Casino
Arizona because the tribe has hired a felon and another man whose
gaming license was revoked by the state.
