Q. I am 54, married, and looking for retirement advice. My
current retirement portfolio consists of a 401(k) plan that
contains $110,000 invested in Putnam Growth and Income and $107,000
in Putnam High Yield Advantage funds. Other assets include $124,000
in common stocks and $115,000 parked in a money market fund. I also
have a life insurance annuity that will pay out $80,000 in the year
2002. At retirement, besides Social Security payments estimated at
$1,400 a month, I will also have a small pension of $300 a month.
My goal is to have at least $60,000 annual income in retirement.
What do you recommend I do with the 401(k)? Other available funds
are Putnam's Voyager, OTC and Emerging Growth, and International.
Do we need more than the 401(k) savings to reach our goal?
With the $9,500 annual additions, the 401(k) should grow to
$669,881 over 11 years, presuming an average 8 percent annual
return. If we make the same assumption for your common stocks, that
segment of the portfolio would be worth $289,123 after 11 years.
If you simply let that $115,000 rot in a money fund and the
truth is I would not be a whole lot more aggressive it would add
up to $196,689.
Finally, if you were to invest the annuity payout that comes in
2002 in a good GNMA fund yielding 6.5 percent a year, you could
expect that to grow to $124,318 over the next seven years. That
takes us to a grand total of $1,280,011 a great deal more than
you will need to supply your expected needs.
As for investments, I'm going to presume your current portfolio
reflects a pretty conservative guy after all, you have about 55
percent of your savings in fixed-income holdings. As I said, I'm
not very positive about stocks at this point, so I won't argue.
But I would at least move the money market funds to Fidelity
Spartan GNMA or Vanguard GNMA. This should get you about a 1.5
percentage point better yield than a money market fund, and over 11
years the interest-rate bumps to which bond funds are prey should
balance themselves out.
Moreover, the difference between a 5 percent yield on $115,000
and a 6.5 percent yield on the same investment works out to $33,313 enough to give you some comfort even if things don't work as I
presume.
Finally, if you put this money (as well as annuity proceeds when
they arrive) in such a fund, by the time you retire the fixed
income side these funds plus the Putnam High Yield Advantage
account will have grown to a size sufficient to meet your
projected income needs.
You could thus leave the balance of the portfolio in equities to
protect you against the likely effects of inflation after
retirement.
Q. I have been building UTMA accounts for my children, aged 10
and 11, since 1991. Each account now is worth a little more than
$19,000, and each contains 400 shares of Vanguard Asset Allocation
fund, 220 shares of Janus Fund, and 135 shares of T. Rowe Price
Blue Chip Growth fund. I currently add $100 a month to each
account. I had always intended this to be the children's college
fund, but now I am considering tapping into these accounts,
beginning in 2001, to pay their tuition at a private high school.
This would cost a little more than $5,000 a year. I would continue
to save college money, but perhaps in my own name, since much has
been made of the decreased potential for financial aid when college
savings are in a child's name. Does this plan raise any red flags?
If it is sound, I think I should move out of an almost all-stock
portfolio into investments that will protect principal, but I don't
know what type of fund would be best. Obviously a money market fund
will protect principal, but I can stand a little more risk in the
short term. Should I make any changes all at once, or in phases?
