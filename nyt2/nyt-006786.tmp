Embracing a trend that is rapidly reshaping the Internet, Walt
Disney Co. let it be known Thursday that the Tomorrowland of
cyberspace will be entered through a giant consumer gateway cobbled
with the gadgets of interactive technologies and the proven lure of
traditional media news, sports, entertainment and information.
On Thursday, Disney announced a complex deal valued at about
$900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service
that helps guide users to what they want on the World Wide Web. The
announcement capped two weeks of fevered developments across media
and technology industries that were too small to shake the
financial markets but obviously a trend that was too significant to
ignore.
Last week, General Electric's NBC unit struck a deal to take
control of Snap, an upstart online directory service, for up to $65
million in cash and more than $100 million in free television
promotions.
On Monday it was reported that ATT had been negotiating to
acquire America Online. And on Tuesday, Microsoft Corp. opened a
public test of its new portal, known as Start, which is expected to
be in full operation by the end of the year.
In the meantime, Netscape Communications Corp. is busy shifting
its focus from making browsers to operating a portal site, and
media giants like Time Warner and News Corp. are looking to build
or buy similar services.
While there are tens of thousands of commercial Web sites, most
of the attention is now focused on the handful that help users find
the information, services or entertainment what they are looking
for. Since many people use these sites to start their treks through
cyberspace, they are far and away the most popular places on the
Internet. As a result, they have attracted the lion's share of
advertising as well as investor interest.
America Online, which 18 months ago was drowning in busy signals
and irate customers, has rebounded into the powerhouse of
cyberspace with 12 million paying customers, a market value of $19
billion and the self assurance to rebuff ATT's takeover offer last
month.
Yahoo, the largest of the free, advertiser-supported portal
services, attracts more than 70 million users a month and has a
value of about $6 billion, despite barely breaking even.
As these sites grow rapidly in market value and viewership if
not profits many media companies are deciding that they need to
buy one quickly, despite the high prices, before they become
unaffordable. More than one media giant has expressed regret for
not having bought America Online when it was much cheaper.
Moreover, as television, telephones and computers all converge
into one integrated network of communications and entertainment,
companies of all sorts see portals as a possible keystone to their
future strategy. The power to funnel users to certain advertisers
and content sites is worth millions of dollars in revenue.
