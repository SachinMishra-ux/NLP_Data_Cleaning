While the sale to the Solomon Islands is military peanuts only
$3.4 million it offers a window into the workings of the small
arms trade which has equipped terrorist organizations and civil
wars from Afghanistan to Rwanda. Within the U.S. government,
arguments that such sales might fuel an ethnic conflict, or go to a
government with a poor human rights record, are routinely drowned
out by arguments that the deal will be good for U.S. business and
improve relations with other countries, U. S. officials say.
Even as the end of the Cold War has brought a decline in
government sales of tanks and jet fighters, the private military
trade is booming. From annual sales of between $2 billion to $3
billion during most of the Cold War, shipments have climbed to more
than $25 billion in 1996, government records show.
But it is the so-called small arms assault rifles, pistols,
mortars that are fueling the regional, ethnic and nationalist
wars.
The Clinton administration has pushed for international treaties
to curb the illegal trade in firearms, because these generally end
up in the hands of street criminals, organized crime syndicates, or
organizations Washington considers terrorist, like the Tamil Tigers
in Sri Lanka.
But there is a growing movement by groups like the British
American Security Information Council and the International
Committee of the Red Cross as well as governments like Norway and
Belgium to put controls on the legal arms trade.
The Solomon Islands deal would likely have remained a secret had
it not been for the change of government there last August, just
weeks after the prior government had ordered the weapons.
The new government has launched an investigation aimed in part
at learning more about the U.S. company that sold the weapons,
Century Arms.
The company is one of the largest arms traders in the United
States but its activities are shrouded in secrecy. The State and
Commerce departments, as well as the Customs Service, all declined
to provide any information about the licenses the company has
received for arms dealings. The company has offices in St. Albans,
Vt., and Boca Raton, Fla. Calls to both of these offices asking for
comment on the Solomon Islands sale were not returned.
OLATHE, Kan. An object found at the regional air traffic
control center in Olathe on Wednesday was a personal joke between a
contractor's employees and was not meant to resemble a bomb,
authorities said Thursday.
Lanza said there was no evidence that the two intended to make
the quart-sized water bottle filled with a brownish-yellow fluid
resemble a bomb.
