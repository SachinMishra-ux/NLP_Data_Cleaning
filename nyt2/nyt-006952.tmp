ANAHEIM, Calif. The rock formation in left-center field at
Edison Field provided a perfect setting for the Mariners'
three-night(mare) visit to the Anaheim Angels' refurbished home.
In a game Mariner starter Jamie Moyer pitched well enough to end
the free-falling defending division champions' most recent skid,
two more errors by third baseman Russ Davis and two of the most
horrific innings of the season turned into an 11-5 debacle before
30,268 fans.
Left fielder Glenallen Hill dropped a line drive in the first
inning that was ruled a hit, leading to a run that negated Ken
Griffey Jr.'s league-leading 27th home run in the top of the
inning.
Moyer shook that off, got out of the inning, and happily sat in
the dugout when Alex Rodriguez's bases-loaded single, Griffey's RBI
hit and Jay Buhner's long sacrifice fly scored four runs in the
third inning.
Angels third baseman Dave Hollins drilled a sharp grounder to
Davis with one out and one on in the third inning, but instead of
catching the ball and starting an inning-inning double play, Davis
leaned over and the ball scooted through his legs. That led to the
Angels' second run.
After Cecil Fielder doubled, Moyer retired Justin Baughman for
the second out and appeared to have retired Phil Nevin on a chopper
to third. Davis charged, put his glove down, pulled it back up and
the ball skittered into the outfield.
When the Mariners went back on defense in the seventh inning,
Jeff Huson was at third base and Davis was sitting in the dugout
wondering why this is happening to him again.
After Gary DiSarcina led off the seventh with a single under
second baseman Joey Cora's glove, a pitching change was made. And
so was the game's complexion.
