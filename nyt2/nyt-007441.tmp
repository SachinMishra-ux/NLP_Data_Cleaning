Hot and muggy conditions will continue over much of the
Southeast. Morning low clouds will yield to afternoon sunshine
dimmed at times by cumulus clouds. Clusters of thunderstorms will
develop over the Ohio Valley and move southeastward, bringing
drenching rains to portions of the region. A vigorous jet stream
disturbance will spawn severe thunderstorms in Michigan with hail,
strong winds, and isolated tornadoes. Thunderstorms will also
develop along a cold front from southern Illinois through northern
Arkansas, while pesky showers and cool breezes swirl around low
pressure from Minnesota to eastern Montana.
Elsewhere, searing heat will continue over Texas. Late day
thunderstorms will develop in the northern Rockies as a disturbance
rotates around low pressure aloft. Building warmth will dominate in
the valleys of the Pacific Northwest, while showers dot the peaks
of the Cascades. The Southwest will be sunny and seasonably warm,
with the exception of low clouds along the California coast.
The official start of summer is at 10:03 a.m. ET Sunday, but
astronomy, not meteorology, is the deciding factor. It is then that
the northward trek of the sun's rays across the planet will cease.
At that moment when the sun stood still, the summer solstice had
arrived. For the next six months, the direct rays of the sun will
move inexorably south, culminating in the winter solstice. But
alas, the summer season is the slowest to fade. As a result of the
elliptical shape of the earth's orbit around the sun, the Northern
Hemisphere summer lasts 93 days while winter is 89 days long.
BORDEAUX, France The temperature on the field was 102 degrees,
which meant that the Mexican fans underneath their licensed
sombreros had a big advantage over the Belgian fans brandishing
inflatable red tridents.
But after the last brow had been mopped and the last water
bottle had been drained, neither of their teams would have an
advantage in the Parc Lescure. This World Cup Group E match was one
that neither Belgium nor Mexico could afford to lose, and, as has
often been the case in France this June, neither team lost.
Of the 26 matches played thus far in the finals, 10 have
finished in draws, but what made this 2-2 affair more compelling
than most was that the Mexicans had to rally from a two-goal
deficit to salvage the point that kept them on top of their
difficult group.
The Belgians took their man advantage in the 29th minute, after
Pavel Pardo was given a red card for a tackle from behind on
Belgian defender Vital Borkelmans. In less evangelical times, the
tackle might have earned Pardo only a yellow card, but in the
current climate, it was difficult to find fault with referee Hugh
Dallas' judgment.
The Belgians, prone to imprecise passing and ballhandling
errors, took their time to capitalize, but in the 44th minute they
scored off a corner kick from their Brazilian-born striker Luis
Oliveira. The ball brushed the head of defender Claudio Suarez and
deflected off Marc Wilmots past Jorge Campos.
It was hardly the most aesthetic goal of this tournament, but
then Wilmots, a solidly built 29-year-old who runs more like a
pulling guard than an attacking midfielder, is not known for his
flair. He is known for his efficiency and his power, and three
minutes into the second half, he took control of the ball outside
the Mexican penalty area and essentially bowled over the luckless
Suarez, shoving him out of the way with his left forearm, and
scoring his second goal with a jab of his right foot.
Perhaps it was the heat, perhaps it was the Mexicans' superior
technical skill, but with only 10 men, they began to penetrate the
Belgian defense with more consistency, and when JesusRamirez drove
into the penalty box and was brought down from behind by Belgian
midfielder Gert Verheyen, the Scottish referee immediately awarded
the Mexicans a penalty kick.
