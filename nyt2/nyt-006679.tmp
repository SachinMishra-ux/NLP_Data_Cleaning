Zellers lured Barron away from Wal-Mart, where he was senior
vice president and chief operating officer of Wal-Mart
International and where he played a major role in Wal-Mart's
aggressive expansion into Canada.
Before Wal-Mart entered Canada in 1994, Zellers accounted for 70
percent of Hudson's Bay profits. By this spring, it had dropped to
36 percent.
Chisholm said a lot of turnaround programs that Barron initiated
never were implemented, partly because of new management at
Hudson's Bay, including the appointment of Bill Fields, another
former top Wal-Mart executive, as president and chief executive
officer.
In any case, Barron left Zellers earlier this year because he
and his family wanted to return to the United States, Payless
spokeswoman Linda Ward said.
Before working in Wal-Mart's international division, Barron was
a vice president of operations for Wal-Mart's U.S. stores. Barron
joined Wal-Mart after working 20 years at Hills Department Stores
Inc. in Massachusetts, where he rose to executive vice president of
store operations.
This room where I work has a door with glass panes, and she

That's certainly one way to look at it and that other three-time
U.S. Open groomsman, Tom Lehman, who has been no worse than tied
for the lead after the first three rounds of the last three Opens,
yet failed to even equal par on the final Sundays.
Theirs are the voices of near-winning-experience at this 98th
U.S. Open, which opened Thursday on the Olympic Club's Lake Course.
And, in a game where the mind can be the enemy, both golfers have
spun sad moments into positive memories.
They didn't lose the Open, they'd tell you: They nearly won it,
and came away with nothing less than the power to win it this time.
