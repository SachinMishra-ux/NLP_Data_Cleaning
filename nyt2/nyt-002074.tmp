Some of the countries that received Yassin were likely motivated
by animosity toward Arafat. There is little good will from Syrian
President Hafez Assad toward the Palestinian leader. And Kuwait's
princes still have not forgiven Arafat for supporting Iraq during
the Persian Gulf War.
But the motivation of other states that receive Yassin is far
more complex. Most of the leaders who welcomed Yassin are battling
Islamic fundamentalist opposition groups. The strategy in these
countries has been to appease and thereby contain them. One theory
is that they are doing the same with Hamas.
For Hamas to play along may signal the beginning of the
organization's slow transformation from a militant movement
responsible for suicide bombings to an open political party, said
Khatib.
Support for Hamas is usually an accurate barometer for
Palestinian support for the peace process. When negotiations go
well, support for Hamas plummets. Conversely, when negotiations
fail, as they have done for 15 months, support for Hamas increases.
But this time, Hamas is reading both the newfound support in the
Palestinian street, and the grand welcomes Yassin has received
abroad, as approval for its strategy of violent resistance rather
than a measure of popular displeasure with the peace process.
NEW YORK It's midnight on a Saturday and a battle is on in the
Bronx. Tammy Keo, 12, is squared against Marcos Oquendo, 19.
Despite the David-and-Goliath mismatch Tammy, known as Lady Love
Bug, stands 4 foot 10, and Oquendo, known as 2 Sweet, is 6 foot 2 there's no turning back.
The young challenger stuffs her ponytails under a knitted cap
and reties the fat shoelaces of her Adidas sneakers. Her opponent
tucks his sleeveless jersey into his boxers. Both are ready for the
three-minute round before 300 spectators at the Hunt's Point
Community Center. In this arena, skill isn't determined by one's
left hook or right jab. The rules are as they've always been: May
the fanciest footwork win.
Such scenes were common 15 years ago, when no street corner or
subway platform was safe from bandanna-wearing breakdancers and
their behemoth boom boxes. The pulsating street theater indigenous
to New York and its spoken accompaniment rap were at the
forefront of the cultural flowering called hip-hop. Hollywood made
movies about breakdancing, dancers performed at the White House and
the sky seemed the limit.
Breakdancing, along with tagging (graffiti writing), emceeing
and deejaying the pillars of hip-hop culture grew into a way of
life.
The retro-'80s vibe that is behind breakdancing's return in the
inner city can be traced back in part to a nostalgia for a more
innocent period of hip-hop. There is a backlash against the
excessive violence and materialism that has been extolled by
gangsta rap for the last decade, culminating in the murders of
Tupak Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. B-boys and B-girls say that their
dance style represents a return to times when people could compete
and live to tell about it.
