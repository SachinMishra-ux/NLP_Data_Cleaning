Workers will build 55,000 old-style Volkswagen Beetles here this
year. All are for the domestic market, where they are the backbone
of motoring for Mexico's middle-class.
Volkswagen has succeeded in raising the level of emotion around
its product. Auto dealers can't get the round little autos in their
shops fast enough to keep up with demand.
Here on the assembly line, that means 16-hour days for Everardo
Rodriguez, a team leader overseeing quality control. Being a part
of Beetle history is worth it, Rodriguez said.
The factory has boosted production by 13 percent since May,
pumping out 450 new Beetles per day. Sportier models with heated
seats and computerized maps for the European market are next on the
agenda.
Michael Wijers, a spokesman for Volkswagen of Mexico, said the
company needed to rebuild its name in the United States.
The automaker's U.S. sales hit bottom in 1993, selling just
44,000 units because of slow production in the Puebla factory,
Fiorani said. It was a far cry from 1968, when the Beetle alone
sold 423,000 units.
Response to the new Beetle concept car at the 1994 Detroit trade
fair was enthusiastic. The question: Where to build this car with
so much riding on it?
Proximity to the American market made Puebla, with a plant east
of Mexico City that employs 15,800 workers, the sensible choice
logistically. In addition, the New Beetle is built on the same auto
platform as the VW Jetta and the Golf, which also are made in
Puebla.
The average wage for a basic-level line worker is about $93 a
week for a six-day, 48-hour workweek in Mexico, compared to $632 at
Volkswagen-Germany's 29-hour, four-day workweek.
Volkswagen officials point to the much higher tax rate German
workers must pay, plus the disparity in living costs in a highly
industrialized economy versus those in a developing economy.
