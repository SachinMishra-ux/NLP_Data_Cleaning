Left-hander Brian Anderson came through with a gritty
seven-inning effort in which he held the Reds scoreless on two
hits. He also singled and provided spark on the basepaths by
scoring two runs.
The victory was achieved in sweltering conditions. Temperature
at game time was 82, but on the artificial turf it had to be at
least 10-15 degrees higher. In addition, the game started at 12:35
p.m. local time after a night game Wednesday.
Anderson's big day came in front of a group of family and
friends from his home area in northern Ohio while he was battling
the onset of a cold.
As he arrived at the park on Thursday, he got some advice from
right-hander Andy Benes, who kept the Reds in check in similar
conditions on Wednesday night by giving up one run on five hits in
eight innings.
To help him win for the fourth time in his past five starts,
Anderson (5-6) also took a page out of the pitching book of
left-hander Omar Daal, who beat the Reds on Tuesday night.
In the third inning, he followed a leadoff double by catcher
Kelly Stinnett with a sacrifice bunt off right-hander Scott
Klingenbeck (1-2). First baseman Eduardo Perez fielded the ball and
tried to get Stinnett at third, but the throw was too late.
Anderson advanced to second when Klingenbeck hit Andy Fox with a
pitch (Fox also was hit by Jeff Shaw in the ninth). Devon White hit
a single to center, scoring Stinnett easily.
Anderson came steaming into third, slowed when third-base coach
Brian Butterfield waited to make the signal and had to shift into
high gear again when Butterfield waved him home. Anderson hit the
dirt and slid a leg between the shin guards of catcher Eddie
Taubensee.
In the fifth, Anderson led off with an infield hit. White hit a
single to left-center with one out and Anderson challenged the arm
of left fielder Dmitri Young, who threw the ball into the dugout
and allowed Anderson to score.
After Karim Garcia's ground-rule double made it 4-0 in the
eighth, Showalter went to right-hander Russ Springer, who gave up
two runs on three hits. Right-hander Gregg Olson rescued Springer
by striking out Taubensee to end the inning, then returned in the
ninth to set down the Reds in order and record his second save in
two games and 10th overall.
