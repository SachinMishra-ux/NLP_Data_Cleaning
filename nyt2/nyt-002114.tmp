That means settlers have had to guess for themselves what the
various proposals would hold for them.
In 1996, they asked a Hebrew University hydrologist, Haim
Gvirtzman, to draw up maps so they could determine how much land
could be ceded to Palestinians while keeping all settlements in
place.
Gvirtzman, a religious settler from the West Bank settlement of
Dolev, determined that Israel would be able to withdraw from only
30 percent about the amount already turned over to Palestinian
control. Anything more would affect at least some settlements,
Gvirtzman determined.
According to Gvirtzman's maps. which were eventually published
by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan
University, a 9 percent Israeli withdrawal would affect about 1,700
settlers living in 10 settlements. If the percentage jumps to 13,
about 9,000 settlers in 18 settlements would be affected. Ofra,
home to the Nizris, would be cut off from Israeli-controlled
territory.
Amid these concerns, Ariel Sharon, Israel's formidable security
hawk and a member of Netanyahu's inner circle, has focused in
public on military issues whenever he tours the West Bank. He
follows the Israeli consensus with the view that Israel must retain
the Jordan Valley, the Judea Desert and a wide corridor to
Jerusalem.
But in his view, Israel must also retain the mountain of western
Samaria, under which a major water aquifer lies, hilltops near
Nablus, where early warning stations are located, and a radius
around Ben Gurion Airport east of Tel Aviv that would cut into part
of the West Bank.
While Sharon's concerns are aimed at Israelis, they have the
potential to affect tens of thousands of Palestinians who live in
these areas.
Netanyahu argues that 98 percent of the Palestinian population
is under Palestinian rule. But that figure is slightly misleading:
98 percent are under the Palestinian Authority's civilian control meaning Palestinian officials collect taxes and run schools there but only 37 percent of Palestinians fall under the full
jurisdiction of Arafat's entity, according to Gvirtzman.
For the Palestinians, the difference is crucial: Israeli
soldiers cannot enter areas under full control of the Palestinian
Authority, but the Israelis still patrol areas they jointly control
with the Palestinians, and they can still set up roadblocks, make
arrests and impose curfews in those areas.
Surrounded by more Palestinian villages than Israeli
settlements, Ofra stands a chance to survive any further withdrawal
only if Israel builds a by-pass road connecting it to the Jordan
Valley to the east.
