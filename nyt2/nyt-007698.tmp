Nor do you have any legal right to take off an hour here or
there for personal business.
Requiring workers to take time off in four-hour blocks may be
necessary in a factory setting, Bradstreet said, if replacement
workers must be hired by the half-day or full-day.
But otherwise, a policy like this actually might end up hurting
the company by keeping workers off the job for more time than
necessary, and by undermining the morale of employees who feel that
they're being unfairly treated.
 Q: I was hospitalized because of complications with a
pregnancy in 1990. At the time, my employer told me that I didn't
qualify for any kind of disability benefits and that my only choice
was to resign. I followed his advice and submitted my resignation
letter. Now I've learned that not only should I have received
disability, but I also should have been rehired after my illness. I
lost almost $10,000 because of this. Do I have any recourse?
 A: Back in 1990, the state and federal laws requiring
companies to give their employees 12 weeks off for serious illness
weren't yet in effect.
But California did have a pregnancy disability law requiring
companies with five or more employees to provide four months of
unpaid leave to employees who are disabled by pregnancy.
If you'd known about that law, you could have taken unpaid time
off to recover from your hospitalization without losing your job.
You also could have applied for state disability insurance, which
would have paid part of your salary while you were off work.
Unfortunately, so much time has passed that now it's too late to
try and recover damages from your employer for misinforming you
about your rights.
The lesson here? If you think you've been denied family or
medical leave illegally, talk to a lawyer or file a complaint
without delay.
