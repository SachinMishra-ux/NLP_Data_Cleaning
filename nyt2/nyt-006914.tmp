Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a
lesson worth pondering. (To publish this excellent article, it must be purchased the rate

SEATTLE Bad as it might get for Paul Westphal next season combine the NBA labor dispute with a significant team rebuild, as
well as Gary Payton's mercurial temperament, and prospects are not
pretty it won't compare to the tub o' goo he found the first time
he replaced a local Sonic hero.
Westphal retains a souvenir from his unlamented Seattle season
of 1980-81, when he was traded from Phoenix for fellow All-Star
guard Dennis Johnson.
Two years after they won the NBA title, the Sonics fell to 34-48
and last in the Pacific Division the fastest, steepest fall for a
champion in NBA history. Along with leading scorer Gus Williams'
season-long contract holdout and forward Lonnie Shelton's broken
wrist after 14 games, Westphal's Sonic career lasted just 36 games
because of a foot injury.
Since he was a free agent after the season and left Seattle for
the New York Knicks, and since Johnson went on to stardom with the
Suns and Boston Celtics, including two championships, it can be
argued that Westphal was part of the worst trade in Seattle pro
sports history (remember, Brian Bosworth was a draft choice).
The Johnson trade ushered in a decade of mediocrity that didn't
end until Karl arrived in 1992. Now, after six years averaging
nearly 60 regular-season wins, the Sonics are at a crossroads
similar to the one two decades earlier on the backside of
success, striving to stay elite.
But the travail of his first Sonic go-round provides a couple of
lessons useful this time: Things can slip away quickly, and one
can't assume that today's pain will be tomorrow's pain.
