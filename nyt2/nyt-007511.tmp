The key for Sparks on Saturday was that the Angels were able to
rally from a 3-0 deficit. They scored three in the bottom of the

he's going to re-sign with the Dodgers in the winter.
Gary Sheffield is a splendid player, but too quiet to steer this
ship. Raul Mondesi looks great in center, less great on a side

leg for a month, making that four-year, $18.5 million contract at
the expense of acquiring a closer questionable.
Thursday, he said making any trades would have to be cleared
with club president Bob Graziano and the Fox people.
