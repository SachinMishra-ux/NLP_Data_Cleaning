Chicago held the Jazz to the fewest points since the invention
of the 24-second shot clock (1954-55) while also producing the most
lopsided margin in Finals history. The Jazz shattered the record
for fewest points in a Finals game (was 71), eclipsed the record
for fewest points in any game (was 55), set marks with 21 field
goals, 23 second-half points and easily topped the largest margin
of defeat (was 35) via the 42-point debacle.
It was clearly Chicago's best game of the playoffs, and Utah's
worst. That toxic combination produced Bulls leads of more than 30
points throughout the second half and swayed experts to now
consider a Chicago four-game run a real possibility. No home team
in NBA history has swept the middle three games under the 2-3-2
format, but the Bulls have all the momentum heading into
Wednesday's Game 4.
The road to Chicago's Six-cess goes through its defense, which
totally suffocated a Utah half-court offense considered one of the
best in the history of basketball. The Jazz, looking more like the
Mavericks' anemic offense of the past two seasons, made 21 baskets
and committed 26 turnovers.
The Bulls smothered the Jazz during a first half in which Utah
almost totally unraveled offensively. Even the usually unflappable
John Stockton became frazzled, committing four turnovers and two
silly fouls in the last minute of a half that ended with Chicago
totally in control at 49-31.
Malone drilled his first six shots, but then went scoreless the
last 15:32 of the half against Dennis Rodman's more aggressive,
physical defense. Seemingly in an unstoppable rhythm against Luc
Longley early, Malone traveled, was called for a charge and
launched an awful airball jump-hook in his only second-quarter shot
against Rodman.
Chicago, dedicated to keeping Stockton out of the middle, also
was successful in taking the Jazz out of its pet pick-and-roll.
Scottie Pippen roamed off Utah's ineffective centers, allowing him
to trap Stockton toward the sideline just past mid-court. Jazz
players not named Malone missed 19 of their first 20 shots including 11 in a row as Chicago scored the last eight points of
the first quarter for a 17-14 lead.
Two driving runners by Pippen took the lead to seven, from which
point the Bulls' Doberman Defense took over. Perennial
all-defensive team members Rodman, Jordan and Pippen attacked and
stifled Utah into missed layups and an embarrassing back-court
violation by Stockton. At one point, the rattled Jazz had 26 points
and 16 turnovers as they were only able to run seven first-half
pick-and-rolls for eight points.
The exclamation point came late in the half as Scott Burrell and
Ron Harper made steals that led to four points in the final 19
seconds to push the lead to 18.
Surprisingly, the Bulls did make one mistake yesterday. They
should have saved this classic performance for the series clincher.
LOS ANGELES Going out on top with USC's College World Series
win, recently deposed play-by-play man Larry Kahn and
broadcast/business partner Mike Lamb delivered fairly classy
parting shots at the end of the broadcast on KPLS-AM (830) Saturday which probably whizzed right by anyone in the Valley who had no
chance of picking up the reception from the Orange County station
on their transistors.
