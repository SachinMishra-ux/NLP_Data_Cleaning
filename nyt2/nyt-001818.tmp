Although his imprimatur provided the first national recognition
for scores of writers who went on to distinguished literary
careers, Abrahams did not shirk the famous. A pushover for funny
stories, he once awarded first prize to Woody Allen.
By 1968 Abrahams was so well established that when Stansky, who
had been a young graduate student at Harvard when the two met, was
named associate professor of history at Stanford, Abrahams had no
trouble moving his base to the West Coast.
The Atlantic Monthly Press cheerfully made him West Coast
editor, something of a misnomer for a man whose authors lived all
over the country. As Abrahams once explained, he could work
anywhere that had a telephone.
Abrahams, whose wit and charm, not to mention his legendary
editing skills, inspired devoted loyalty in his authors, would
probably not have been allowed to retire if he wanted to, but he
had showed no sighs of abandoning his lifelong quest for literary
quality.
The economies of the United States and Britain have moved in
surprisingly similar ways in recent years, whether by coincidence
or because both freed their economies in the 1980s. Now Britain's
central bank has stunned observers by raising interest rates,
posing the question whether the Federal Reserve will be the next to
do so.
The Bank of England boosted its base lending rate on Thursday by
a quarter of a percentage point, to 7.5 percent. It said it had
acted because of concerns that wages were rising too rapidly and
consumer spending was so brisk that a revival of inflation was a
serious threat.
Nearly all British economists who monitor the Bank of England 19-of-20, according to a poll by Bloomberg News had expected the
central bank to leave rates unchanged. That was largely because of
signs that Britain's economy is slowing, particularly in exports.
Both stock and bond prices fell in London after the bank's move was
announced.
There are obvious differences between the United States and
Britain, but current economic arguments in both countries are
surprisingly similar. There are inflationary pressures in the U.S.
labor market, about which more will be known on Friday when the
employment figures for May are released, and consumer spending has
been very strong. But inflation does not look like much of a threat
when commodity prices are falling and there is fear that Asian
weakness could slow the economy here. So the Fed has not taken any
action.

Christian schools across America, with a mission to major in Jesus
Christ and minor in everything else.
Grace is housed in a small white clapboard schoolhouse beside a
dried-up creek in Mason, a pretty ranching town of 2,100 people.
