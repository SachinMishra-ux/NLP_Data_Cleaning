Clinton also hopes to underscore China's long history of unity
and achievement, while, at the same time, spotlighting its vast
potential for the future.
Those themes will underpin his planned visit to the Great Wall,
built 2200 years ago to keep out invaders from the north.
Of the dozens of sites he plans to visit the terra-cotta
warriors near Xian, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the stock
exchange in Shanghai there are dozens more his advance team
considered, surveyed and later rejected.
Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
WASHINGTON Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions. It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
