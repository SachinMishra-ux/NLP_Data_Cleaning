So they came with guns blazing. They controlled the ball for 34
minutes, 20 of them in the attacking zone. They took 27 shots.
Brian McBride hit the crossbar. Claudio Reyna hit the right post.
David Regis hit the left post. Frankie Hejduk nearly blew a hole
through the keeper's gut from sawed-off shotgun range. Nothing. Not
until 87 of the 90 minutes had ticked down and Iran was already up
by two goals.
The Americans never dreamed it would not be them. Even though
they had struggled to qualify for the tournament, they had
developed a reputation for winning the important match or at
least not losing it. They had played down a man for much of a
qualifying match against Mexico in Mexico City's foul thin air and
managed a scoreless draw. They had beaten the Canadians by three
goals in Vancouver to get here. They figured they could win last
night, even if the ball wasn't bouncing for them.
They are still not good enough to get a result, even after three
consecutive trips to the World Cup. Getting a result is a soccer
term for extracting exactly what you need out of a match. Three
points, one point, or zero points with only one goal allowed. The
countries that win World Cups the Brazils, the Germanys, the
Italys, the Argentinas know how to get a result.
The Americans, down 1-0, lost 2-1. So they'll fly to Nantes
today and sit around a seaside hotel for three days and wait to
play a match that will mean something in Belgrade but nothing in
Boston. They've canceled next weekend's just-in-case hotel
reservations in Montpellier and Toulouse. Come Friday, they'll put
on their blue blazers and neckties and fly home to a country that
will be watching baseball and Wimbledon.
There is still time for National Basketball Association players
to form a team and compete for the United States in Athens, Greece,
this summer, just as there is still time for the players and owners
to agree on a deal that would ensure labor peace before the current
collective-bargaining agreement expires on July 1.
But given the stubborn climate of recent negotiations, neither
appears likely. Even with a meeting Monday in New York, both sides
appear headed toward a long, tense summer of bargaining. With major
monetary issues on the table, the league faces the growing
possibility of losing games to labor strife for the first time.
Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players'
association, proposed last Wednesday that both sides agree to a
moratorium rather than the owners' locking out the players. A
lockout would prohibit any NBA business between players and teams,
meaning the free-agent signing period, set to begin July 1, would
be postponed indefinitely.
But the owners will not accept any deal that allows more
contracts or trades to be signed and consummated under the current
rules. Barring major concessions, two league officials confirmed
last Friday, a lockout is imminent.
Using the world championships in Athens as a platform, the 12
NBA players selected for the team have decided to boycott the games
until a labor agreement is reached. USA Basketball, the
organization that selects teams for international play, stoked the
fires last week, saying it would send another team to Athens.
There is hope for Grant Hill, Gary Payton and friends to play
overseas. FIBA, which oversees international competition, has
privately intimated to USA Basketball that it would accommodate
last-minute replacements in order to field the best team possible.
It is a move that would clear the way for NBA players to decide to
compete shortly before the games begin on July 29.
