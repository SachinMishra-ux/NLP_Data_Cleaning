Of course, that prompted an angry response from Piazza. Standing
in the cramped clubhouse at Fenway Park before Sunday night's game
against the Red Sox, Piazza speculated that Martinez's sensitivity
about the subject might be evidence that he had thrown at him on
purpose. Keeping with the World Wrestling Federation theme, Piazza
even challenged Martinez to journey the 200 yards across Fenway to
locate him.
Despite the mutual hostility, Piazza and Martinez both said they
did not have previous problems with each other. Both said they had
few encounters off the field when they were teammates.
Martinez conceded he has thrown at hitters, but only after one
of his teammates, as Piazza used to be, was already hit.
Essentially, that is what Piazza was hinting at on Friday, even
though no Red Sox were hit and it was the first game of the season
between the New York and Boston.
Piazza was surprised that Martinez used profanities and
surprised that Martinez sounded so defensive Sunday. The catcher
then tweaked Martinez a final time before the two players and the
two teams part for the rest of the regular season.
From Tibetan Buddhists to Roman Catholics to evangelical
Christians, a broad array of religious leaders is urging President
Clinton to use his summit meeting later this month in Beijing to
press the Chinese government to end the repression of religious
believers there.
Religious persecution abroad has increasingly become a major
cause of concern among members of the U.S. clergy, many of whom say
that China is one of the most consistent violators of religious
freedom. Now rights advocates long concerned about the Chinese
occupation of Tibet have joined forces with Christian clergy
pushing for more freedom for Chinese churchgoers.
More than 200 U.S. religious leaders have signed a letter to the
president asking him to put pressure on the Chinese government to
release all religious prisoners, to rescind decrees forcing
Christian churches to register with the government, and to open
negotiations about the future of Tibet with the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan Buddhists' exiled leader.
The letter, drafted by the Center for Jewish and Christian
Values in Washington, is signed by people whose names rarely appear
on the same page. They include two Roman Catholic cardinals and
more than a dozen bishops, a spokesman for the Church of
Scientology, Reform and Orthodox rabbis, evangelical Christian
ministers and broadcasters, Muslims, Tibetan Buddhists, and a wide
range of other religious leaders.
For most of the last decade, Cisco Systems Inc. has been
steamrolling competitors in data networking. Its routers and
switches dominate the Internet and corporate networks that try to
get disparate sorts of computers to talk to each other.
It holds a 70 percent market share in routers and related
products, and the company's $79.3 billion value in the stock market
is more than four times the combined stock market value of its main
rivals: 3Com Corp., Bay Networks Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc.
