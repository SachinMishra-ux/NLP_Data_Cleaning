PARIS They eat clay, drink clay, sleep clay, think clay.
According to them, they were born with their sneakers covered with
the stuff and have been sliding around on it since. For them, it's
terra firma.
So somehow it seems only appropriate that Carlos Moya and Alex
Corretja, a couple of Spaniards who have lately been knocking on
the door of Grand Slam and top 10 respectability, have landed in
the final of the French Open.
This Grand Slam tournament may be in France, which moaned Friday
when the Paris native, Cedric Pioline, disintegrated in straight
sets in his steamy afternoon semifinal against Corretja, but this
year the men's final belongs to Spain. Just as it did in 1994 when
its then-defending champion Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto
Berasetegui.
Pioline called it a bit of a puzzle that, although France boasts
the only Grand Slam tournament played on red clay, Spain boasts the
only genuine bumper crop of red clay artists. Spain sent 19 men to
this tournament, five of them seeded.
The 21-year-old Moya, who first showed up on the Grand Slam
radar when he took a sleeper run to the 1997 Australian Open final,
defeated his training and dining companion, the 15th-seeded Felix
Mantilla, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, Friday to achieve his first French
Open final. Unlike his experience in Australia, Moya had been
fixated not only on reaching, but winning, this final even before
he arrived in Paris with a Monte Carlo title for ballast.
But so does his countryman, the 14th-seeded Alex Corretja, the
unassuming baseliner who gained his Grand Slam notoriety with a
Kafkaesque experience at the 1996 U.S. Open, where he
double-faulted at match point of his five-set quarterfinal against
a reeling, choking and nauseated Pete Sampras.
After 4 hours 9 minutes, Sampras soldiered on and later claimed
that year's championship. Apparently a glutton for punishment,
Corretja set a Grand Slam longevity record with his
5-hour-31-minute marathon with Hernan Gumy here in the third round.
This time the resilient Spaniard produced an 11-9 fifth-set,
tie-breaker decision.
Like the taller, more nimble Moya, the 24-year-old Corretja has
been concentrating on developing his all-court skills, especially a
serviceable volley, and Friday he used every square inch of the
center court as he dismissed the exhausted Pioline, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
The 17th-ranked, soon-to-be 29-year-old Frenchman had played a
trio of five-setters en route to his first Roland Garros semifinal.
Friday, he could barely get his serve across the net, much less
create the flamboyant volleys necessary to detour Corretja's
passing shots.
The 12th-seeded Moya, the highest seeded man left in the
tournament, had the more treacherous trip to the final. He
inherited the responsibility of eliminating third-seeded Marcelo
Rios, the Chilean who had been favored to win his first Slam here
as well as re-acquire the No. 1 ranking, in the quarterfinal round.
