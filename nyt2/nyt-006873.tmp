In the deposition, Casey testified that he also changed Livoti's
shift, gave him a new partner, talked with him and recommended to
him that he undergo psychological counseling.
Livoti is currently on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
on a charge of depriving Baez of his civil rights. In October 1996,
he was acquitted of state charges of criminally negligent homicide
in Baez's death. The acquittal ignited street protests in the Bronx
and focused more attention on the issue of police brutality. In
February 1997, after a separate administrative trial, the Police
Department dismissed Livoti from the force after finding that he
had used an illegal and deadly choke hold on Baez.
The lawyer for Livoti, Stuart London, who has said that his
client denies all wrongdoing in the Baez case as well as in other
civilian complaints, did not return calls to his pager last night.
But the testimony by Casey shows that, as early as 1991,
high-level police officials were aware of the concerns about Livoti
and did not take action.
Thursday, the government continued to present its civil rights
case against Livoti; the trial has included testimony from members
of Baez's family that they saw Livoti grab Baez around the neck. In
the early morning hours of Dec. 22, 1994, Baez, 29, was tossing a
football with his three brothers near their childhood home in the
University Heights section of the Bronx, where Baez was visiting
from his home in Florida. When the brothers' football hit a patrol
car repeatedly, Livoti got out of his car and confronted the
brothers in an incident that ultimately led to the struggle in
which prosecutors say Livoti choked Baez. Baez died shortly
thereafter
Casey's testimony in the deposition also points to the influence
that the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, has
in disciplinary matters. Casey testified that his case for Livoti's
transfer had to be even stronger because the officer was the
precinct's union delegate.
Parts of the chief's deposition remain sealed under an order
from Justice McKeon. A lawyer for the Baez family, Susan Karten,
declined to make a copy available or to discuss it, citing the
judge's order.
Casey, who is assigned to the Department's organized-crime
control bureau, referred a request for comment to a Department
spokeswoman, who declined to comment.
Lawyers defending New York City in the Baez family's civil suit
have sought to keep Casey's testimony out of the public record,
requesting the confidentiality order and objecting in a hearing
April 7 before McKeon when one of the family's lawyers referred
briefly to the transfer recommendation.
In his deposition, Casey said that Livoti was the first officer
he had ever tried to transfer, and that he had done a full analysis
of Livoti's civilian complaint record. Although details of that
record were not available Tuesday, federal prosecutors, in court
papers, have described one incident which the jury will not hear
about in court that predates the chief's June 1991 recommendation
to transfer Livoti.
