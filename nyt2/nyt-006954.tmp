After Cecil Fielder doubled, Moyer retired Justin Baughman for
the second out and appeared to have retired Phil Nevin on a chopper
to third. Davis charged, put his glove down, pulled it back up and
the ball skittered into the outfield.
When the Mariners went back on defense in the seventh inning,
Jeff Huson was at third base and Davis was sitting in the dugout
wondering why this is happening to him again.
After Gary DiSarcina led off the seventh with a single under
second baseman Joey Cora's glove, a pitching change was made. And
so was the game's complexion.
Paul Spoljaric fed Darin Erstad a pitch that was hit back up the
middle, slightly to the pitcher's right. Out of instinct, Spoljaric
took a stab at the ball and knocked it toward Huson, who fielded it
barehanded but threw late to first. No one covered third base,
allowing DiSarcina to keep running, putting runners on first and
third with none out instead of nobody on with two outs.
Cora, closest to the ball, pointed at it but did not give chase.
Griffey charged in but arrived too late to make the catch.
Anaheim loaded the bases when Spoljaric, fielding pinch-hitter
Craig Shipley's bunt, threw late to third base. Bobby Ayala, whose
sinker is supposed to produce ground balls, entered with a 5-4 lead
and promptly gave up long sacrifice flies that produced the tying
and go-ahead runs.
The first-place Angels, playing with supreme confidence, treated
Ayala rudely in the eighth inning, scoring five runs. Besides
surrendering five hits in the inning, Ayala uncorked a wild throw
to third base.
The bad news: most of the ticket buyers probably have been
reading, watching and listening about a team that has lost five
straight and 14 of its past 17 games to fall into the division
cellar.
Washington's day-after obituaries opened with scathing sound
bites from Democrats and promises to pummel Republicans on tobacco
in November.
But Republicans are betting that while tobacco has replaced
Monica Lewinsky as the hottest Beltway topic this summer, it's no
burning issue in the hinterlands. By the time November rolls
around, they calculate, voters will have forgotten the big tobacco
bill, which even legislators didn't fully understand.
