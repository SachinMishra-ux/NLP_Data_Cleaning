MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) It is still a bad educational idea,
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision allowing parents to send
their children to religious schools with tax-funded vouchers is
energizing the conservative school-choice movement. Let's improve

THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) A good example of mendacity and
hypocrisy is the tobacco industry's $40 million propaganda campaign
to make it appear that the defeated anti-tobacco bill was just
another manifestation of lawmakers' greed for more money to
increase the size of government. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already

The wage the government has set about $6 an hour for adults is not as high as union leaders had hoped. But in a country whose
once-powerful unions were all but emasculated by Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, the plan was seen as an important
victory for workers' rights. It will take effect next April.
In announcing the plan, Board of Trade president Margaret
Beckett said the gap between lowest- and highest-paid workers had
almost doubled in the last two decades. She accused the previous
government of abandoning the working poor to the whims of stingy
employers.
Under the plan, workers aged 22 and older will receive a minimum
of about $6 an hour. Those from 18 to 21 will receive a lower rate,
of about $5 an hour, which will increase to about $5.35 in June
2000. The minimum wage will not apply to younger people or to those
on apprenticeships.
The plan, the government said, will increase the wages of some 2
million people who currently earn less than the proposed minimum,
some of whom are working for less than $1.50 an hour.
The opposition Conservative Party, which has pressed for a
minimum income level, with pay subsidized by benefits, rather than
a minimum wage, attacked the plan.
Since the Labor government came into power last year, it has
been examining ways of putting a minimum wage in place. But the
question of what the rate would actually be has been the subject of
bitter debate.
