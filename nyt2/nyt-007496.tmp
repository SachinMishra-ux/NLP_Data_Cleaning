This marks the first trip of a US president to China since
President Bush traveled to Beijing in 1989, months before the
massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of student protesters on
Tiananmen Square. It is also the longest tour of any one country by
Clinton a partial payback, according to administration officials,
for Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 10-day US visit in October.
White House aides said Clinton, in tone and substance, will
strive to resemble House Speaker Newt Gingrich in his 1997 visit to
China, rather than Vice President Al Gore in his trip to Beijing
last year. Gore was widely perceived as unprepared and too
laudatory, while Gingrich received many plaudits back home, from
Republicans and Democrats, for upbraiding Chinese leaders on human
rights concerns.
In all, the presidential entourage will include a fleet of 747
jets packed with several hundred reporters, Cabinet secretaries,
White House aides, and other administration officials. The trip
will begin Thursday in the city of Xian, the ancient capital of
China and home to the famed terra cotta soldiers, and end on July 3
in Hong Kong, a symbol of China's potential future.
Among those traveling in the entourage will be US Representative
Edward J. Markey, a Malden Democrat and a member of the House
Commerce Committee. Also on the trip will be Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin,
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, and Secretary of Commerce
William M. Daley.
Still, at each stop, there will be questions, not just over
China's actions but over Clinton's motivations.
Back in Washington, Clinton has been accused by Republicans of
accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal campaign
contributions from Chinese agents trying to influence the 1996 US
election. In the last two months, he has been accused of approving
potentially harmful missile-technology transfers to China by Loral
Space Communications, a US company whose owner was the single
biggest Democratic contributor in 1996.
Congress has since banned such technology transfers. Clinton has
denied wrongdoing, saying he was simply adhering to a program that
was begun by President Reagan and continued under Bush. More than
100 Republican House members, including Gingrich, have demanded
that Clinton postpone his trip until the investigations into the
Loral transfer are completed.
In terms of concrete accomplishments, the United States is
hoping to sign a pact with China to no longer target each other
with nuclear missiles. Still, even that plan is considered largely
symbolic, because such missiles can be retargeted in a matter of
minutes. China has more than a dozen long-range missiles pointed at
the United States, and the United States has many more aimed at
China.
Clinton will seek to closely involve China in stemming the
possibility of a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan,
partly by urging Chinese leaders to sever the flow of missile
technology to Pakistan, and partly by leading through a continued
example of nonproliferation.
Economic officials will continue to laud the Chinese over their
decision not to devalue their currency in the face of economic
turmoil across Asia, and urge them to continue to maintain the
value.
