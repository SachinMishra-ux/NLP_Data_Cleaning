Thierry Henry scored France's first goal on a nice feed from
Zidane in just the ninth minute, then young David Trezeguet, 20,
added a nice rip into the net in the 68th minute.
Henry added his third goal of the tournament in the 77th minute,
and Lizarazu finished things off after the snazzy pass from
Djorkaeff.
But it's no wonder that the aptly named Guppy is soon hooked.
He's got all the comforts of home plus regular sex and some very
nice gifts. Things get more complicated, however, when Joyce
demands her share of the action. Their not-quite menage a trois
becomes a fertile breeding ground for sexual tension, blackmail,
jealousy and worse.
In one of the more disturbing film introductions in a while, we
meet 5-year-old Danny shortly before he plunges his hands into a
pregnant neighbor's womb
(Blethyn plays the mom). That's because she's gone into labor
unexpectedly, and it's up to him to disentangle the baby from the
umbilical cord.
The baby is a girl, christened Anna. And Danny swears he'll
someday marry her. Jump ahead 20 years. Danny is now played by Law,
Anna by a lovely but gratingly shrill actress named Gretchen Mol.
Though she's engaged to a rich guy (Jon Tenney), Danny, back
from living abroad for two decades, falls for Anna all over again.
And angles to win her back.
Blethyn is wasted as an exuberant life force saddled with one of
those obscure terminal diseases you only get in movies. Law does
his best to hold onto his dignity in an underwritten, uninteresting
role.
But you can't help but feel some contact humiliation when the
actors have to mouth Peters' empty homilies about love and fate.
The movie is an embarrassment of twitches.
The testimony by the lawyer, Francis Carter, has been sought
from the outset of the inquiry by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr. Carter helped prepare a document on Ms. Lewinsky's behalf in
the Paula Jones lawsuit, in which Ms. Lewinsky denied under oath
that she had had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
