Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
