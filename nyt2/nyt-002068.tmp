SAN FRANCISCO The San Francisco International Airport has
announced it will seek to expand its runways, a job that could
entail filling part of the San Francisco Bay. And that could cause
a landslide of environmental opposition.
Airport officials say chronic flight delays, the increasing
popularity of air travel and the introduction of larger planes make
it essential to upgrade the 60-year-old runways soon.
Airport officials said the possibilities range from filling the
Bay for extra space to building floating runways or raising them
out of the water like bridges.
But Will Travis, director of the Bay Area Conservation and
Development Commission, the agency that decides whether to issue
permits for Bay construction, said he believed the airport was
acting prematurely.
The airport's parallel runways are only 750 feet apart. While
planes can land side by side in good weather, all it takes is a few
clouds to force the airport to use only one runway, cutting in half
the number of planes that can land.
Over and over again this year, this reduction in the airport's
landing capacity has created a logjam of stranded planes at other
airports and caused hundreds of delays and cancellations in San
Francisco.
Martin said he was looking for a solution that would improve the
runways' ability to function in bad weather and handle large
planes, while at the same time reducing noise problems and
improving the Bay's overall environmental health.
