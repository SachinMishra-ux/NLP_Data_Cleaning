The Liberal Party, which advocates precisely the far-reaching
economic reorganization and stimulus policies that Washington would
like to see in Japan, had the support of 1.7 percent.
There have been widespread hints that Hashimoto will be more
aggressive in tackling Japan's financial problems immediately after
the election. But that, too, tells something about the public mood.
Instead of promising before the election to address the economic
mess and the mountain of bad bank loans, the speculation is that he
will tackle these issues only after he no longer has to face the
voters.
Morse argues that Japan suffers from cronyism and structural
economic problems quite similar to those of South Korea and
Indonesia. Those countries were bailed out by the International
Monetary Fund on the condition that they accept painful
reorganization.
But Japan has not collapsed in the way that South Korea or
Indonesia did, so Morse said he believed that the political process
would not lead to a fundamental overhaul of the economy.
WASHINGTON India has produced countless styles of manuscript
painting. Among the most poetic, and certainly the most popular
outside India itself, are those that emerged in the 17th century in
the Hindu Rajput kingdoms nestled in the remote mountain valleys of
the Himalayan foothills.
Paintings from the Punjab hills, or Pahari paintings, with their
palettes of vegetable green, dusky orange, and afterglow lavender,
are soaked in a spirit of place. In them, days are lambent, nights
hushed and star-strewn. Figures have a serene perfection. Slender
women wear neat, fitted dresses. Men and gods, adhering to an
ultrastylish ideal of sartorial machismo, sport garlands and
turbans and pearl-drop earrings.
If ever there was a peaceable kingdom, it would seem, this is
it. Yet for all their lyricism, these paintings are often shot
through with unsettled passions. Characters depicted are skittishly
seductive or gripped by panic. Many are obsessed by one overarching
theme: the heartache and joy of religious and erotic desire.
A few of the paintings in the show, which has been organized by
Vidya Dehejia, associate director and chief curator of the Sackler
and the Freer Gallery of Art, are from the plains of Rajasthan in
northwestern India.
But most are from the hills, and many can be traced to the
kingdom of Kangra, where a single royal patron, Raja Sansar Chand
(who reigned from 1775 to 1823), nurtured a distinctive house
style, one that blended Mughal naturalism and stylized Rajput
traditions.
