Given the stipulations, several private agencies, including
schools run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, have
passed up the offer.
The privatization issue has not drawn opposition from the
teachers' union. An estimated 225 teachers will be hired to
instruct children in prekindergarten.
Although enrollment is optional for parents, each of the city's
school districts will be required to accommodate 16 percent of
their estimated population of 4-year-olds, or a citywide total of
14,000 children.
Five of the most overcrowded districts have yet to find room in
their buildings or in private preschools to accommodate their share
of prekindergartners in the fall, though Board of Education
officials say they are optimistic that room will be found soon.
Those five are District 6 in upper Manhattan, Districts 9 and 11
in the Bronx and Districts 24 and 29 in Queens.
Most districts are selecting students either by lottery or on a
first-come-first-served basis. The state law mandates that
districts gradually expand the number of slots so that by fall
2002, any 4-year-old can enroll in a prekindergarten class.
But accommodating all children whose parents want them in the
program by 2002 is likely to be a formidable challenge, given the
lack of new school buildings and parallel state legislation
requiring cuts in class size beginning in fall 1999.
For prekindergarten alone, 30,000 seats, or 1,750 classrooms,
would have to be built or found by 2002, according to estimates by
the Board of Education. To reduce class size, 45,552 more seats more than 2,000 classrooms would be required. This fall, the
board will open six new schools with about 5,000 seats.
District 19 on the eastern fringe of Brooklyn, for example, has
little room for prekindergarten in its Cypress Hills neighborhood,
the densely populated northern part of the district where schools
are already so crowded that kindergartners are bused to Starrett
City, several miles south.
Touring his district and looking for prekindergarten space the
other day, Superintendent Robert Riccobono said he wondered whether
parents in Cypress Hills would shepherd their children to the
southern end of the district, where there is ample space for
prekindergarten: Within a two-block radius in Starrett City, he had
found a public school that could house a couple of prekindergarten
classes, as well as a yeshiva and a secular preschool.
