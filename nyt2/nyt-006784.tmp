Over the past decade, quinacrine tablets that Mumford and fellow
contraceptive researcher Elton Kessel have distributed to Third
World countries have been used to sterilize more than 100,000
women.
Since Mumford's controversial role in international
contraception was reported in Thursday's editions of The Wall
Street Journal, the phone has been ringing in his brick split-level
house on the outskirts of this university town. Mostly, he said,
news organizations wanted him to elaborate on his views, or appear
on television talk shows where, Mumford concedes, he would likely
be lambasted as inhumane or crazy.
He said much of the U.S. population growth over the next half
century will be driven by immigrants, and he fears they will sap
the nation's resources and drive down the overall standard of
living.
First used by American soldiers in World War II to prevent
malaria, quinacrine is barred in the United States for
sterilizations. Many health organizations question its
effectiveness considering the possible risks.
Funded over the past decade by $1 million from U.S. backers,
including anti-immigration advocates, Mumford's efforts are
familiar to some in the field of population control. The recent
publicity, however, unleashed fresh criticism that repressive
governments can use quinacrine sterilization against women's will.
Mumford worked for the organization , but left in the early
1980s in a rift with more traditional researchers. His views on
immigration illustrate the split.
ATLANTA -- Mark Wohlers began walking from the bullpen with the
last pitch Thursday and did not stop until he found himself in the
manager's office, asking Bobby Cox to send him to the minors.
Although the Braves are uncertain how to handle the transaction,
Wohlers will leave today for the club's minor-league complex in
Orlando, where the deposed closer will attempt to relocate the
strike zone. To remain with the Braves had become a waste of
everyone's time.
The Braves closed out their nine-game homestand with a 3-2 loss
to the Florida Marlins, who beat Tom Glavine (9-3) for their first
road victory since May 18. Atlanta went 5-4 against visiting
Boston, Montreal and Florida, which claimed its sixth away victory
on an RBI single by Todd Ziele off Dennis Martinez with two outs in
the eighth.
Atlanta opens a weekend series in Montreal tonight. In the
meanwhile, the Braves are plotting options with Wohlers. The club
could place him on the disabled list again, claiming he is still
unfit to pitch because of the torn left oblique injured on May 4.
He then would be eligible to appear in Gulf Coast (Rookie) League
games with the Gulf Coast Braves.
