Adams' father, Les, the captain of a tugboat, said he had long
contemplated these issues. As he sat bobbing on his boat, he
explained that he knew many years ago that Evan was capable of
extraordinary accomplishments. And he said that he had sternly
instructed his son to focus his ambition on the world beyond the
reservation.
But, he admitted, Evan made it clear early on that he had his
own ideas about heritage and creativity. As a teen-ager, for
example, Evan learned and performed traditional dances that had
been little seen for years. Les Adams recalled bringing a friend,
the chief of a nearby tribe, to one of Evan's performances and
being struck to see his friend cry at one point.
Evan did go away to a private high school when he was 14 and
then to McGill University in Montreal. His father said he was
crushed when Evan announced that he was leaving McGill after a
year, to pursue acting.
Evan said that part of his struggle over the years had come from
his mixed feelings about living in a dominantly white society.
He described his swings from one world to the other while
showing a reporter an extraordinary collection of totem poles,
masks and other ceremonial objects preserved in the glass and
concrete Museum of Anthropology on the University of British
Columbia campus. He insisted that he was trying to find a way of
revering the past while shaping a new kind of future that was true
to both the Indian spirit and the modern spirit.
