Lynn says she shot him on purpose, angry that he would not let
her keep the CD at her house for a while longer. She told police it
was an accident.
Lynn stumbled back into the living room and lay on the floor,
blood pouring from his chest. The CD supposedly in dispute kept
playing Shakur's All Eyez on Me.
Gunfire is part of the nightly serenade in Lynn's neighborhood,
just south of Seventh and Dobbins avenues and not far from the
Phoenix Police Academy shooting range. Still, Lynn never thought he
would get hit.
 Before he was shot, Lynn was cocky, he admits, not wanting to
listen to what his parents told him. Now, when they ask where he is
going and when he will be back, he answers them with a smile.
If he is outside at the park or walking home from school and
hears gunfire, he takes off running.
The night before Lynn was shot, he played in an all-star
baseball game. He was hospitalized for three days. Now, almost a
year later, Lynn can move his arm and even throw a ball.
Still, he can't open his hand. His fingers remain clenched. He's
em barrassed by it, tucking his hand behind his hip. But he can put
a ball in his hand and release it a throw he's working on. Lynn
started back to school as a freshman at South Mountain High in
February, writing with his left hand. Only a few friends know he
was shot. Few of his teachers know.
So, for now, he helps his father coach his little brother's
baseball team and watches Arizona State University and the Arizona
Dia mondbacks on television.
He works his arm constantly squeezing balls, lifting weights,
stretching. Lynn wants to play for ASU and then for the Diamond
backs, though he's never been to a game.
In an instant, the bullet shattered her assumption that her
children would be with her always, she would watch them graduate
from high school, then college, see them go to work, grow into
adulthood.
