Although Morris's mother died in 1993 from smoking-related
cancer, he said he raised the issue with the Clinton administration
in purely political terms.
It was, by many accounts, a novel and potentially effective
idea, one with a clear villain and an obvious beneficiary take on
the mammoth tobacco companies for the sake of America's children.
Morris drew then-FDA chief David Kessler into the fray, who
lobbied Vice President Al Gore for his support. With Gore as the
leader, the group made a strong case to Clinton in the spring of
1995. Gore, a Tennessee native, persuaded Clinton he could survive
the issue in the tobacco-growing states in the 1996 elections.
Within days of the accord, Clinton called on Congress to approve
it so he could sign it into law. But the settlement was never again
the same.
In the Senate, Lott said he would recuse himself from the
tobacco debate because Scruggs, who stands to make millions of
dollars in fees for helping Moore win the Mississipi case, is his
brother-in-law. Lott appointed a deputy, Senator Don Nickles,
Republican of Oklahoma, to handle the issue.
At first, the tobacco plan was so broad that seven Senate
committees claimed jurisdiction over it. Several chairmen wrangled
behind-the-scenes for months for control of the bill before Senator
John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Commerce Committee,
prevailed.
For McCain, who is considering running for president, the
assignment was a powerful opportunity to boost his national
profile. But in the Senate, where 15 other members have either
sought the presidency or expressed interest in running in 2000, the
job also stirred the competitive fires of some potential foes.
But other opposition arose. When McCain's bill cleared the
committee, it dwarfed last year's settlement with the states,
raising the price by nearly $150 billion and removing immunity from
future class-action suits.
Indeed, a week after McCain's bill passed in the committee, the
tobacco industry vowed to kill the measure. That was no idle threat
on Capitol Hill, where big tobacco has long succeeded in defeating
legislation.
With 200 lobbyists on its payroll or two for each of the 100
senators the industry quickly went to work. But the lobbyists
needed help, and the industry soon launched an unprecedented
advertising blitz to turn voters against the bill.
