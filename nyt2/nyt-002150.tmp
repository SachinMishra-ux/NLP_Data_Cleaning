Smaller companies, which purchase time on the networks of larger
companies, sometimes offer the lowest rates.
CGI Long Distance Services, based in Mission, offers a rate of
10 cents a minute. Customers can keep their existing long-distance
service and get the CGI service by dialing a seven-digit access
code.
A Miami company, One Flat Rate.Com, advertises on the Internet
that it offers a flat rate of 8.9 cents a minute with no fees.
The amendment which for the first time in a generation would
have permitted school-sponsored organized prayer and religious
displays on public property received a majority with 224 votes.
Had the amendment passed, it would have required a similar
majority in the Senate and then ratification by three-fourths of
the state legislatures.
But the measure was a victory in any case for religious
conservatives and their supporters in Congress, who had made it a
legislative priority. It was the first time in 27 years that
Congress recorded a vote on a school prayer amendment and
Thursday's vote will become a political marker for the fall
elections.
An effort to remove the word from the measure was defeated, as
was an attempt to send the entire amendment back to committee.
And while the issue was certain to evoke strong passions, the
debate took on an even greater urgency among supporters. Against a
backdrop of recent killings in several of the nation's schools,
many speakers equated the attacks with the absence of a religious
presence in the classroom.
Supporters argued that children ought to be able to initiate
voluntary prayers in classrooms, at graduations, at sporting events
and other school activities. The amendment, they said, does not
require that everyone must join in, nor does it prescribe what
prayer should be said, nor establish an official religion.
But since the last vote on school prayer in 1971 when the
supporters actually gained more votes with 240 in favor and 163
against but still failed to reach a two-thirds majority faith and
family issues have moved center stage, especially in politics.
