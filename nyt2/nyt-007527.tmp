In fact, he is one of several players who shifted their
attention from the game mystery to Sirius business.
Among their discoveries, confirmed by Gnant: The publishing
company has cut its staff from 80 employees to 25, closed its
headquarters and moved operations into a warehouse. Gnant said
those moves reflect Sirius' new direction, not financial problems.
James Beckett, a 62-year-old retiree from Corning, N.Y., found a
1991 commercial bankruptcy involving another Gnant business,
Express Technologies Inc., and lawsuits against Sirius alleging
unpaid debts. Gnant said the complaints arose from disputes with
suppliers over unsatisfactory products.
Suspicion about the winner also stems from a dispute over key
literary quotes used in solving the riddle. Wigowsky and others say
the phrases contain errors. Gnant denies there are mistakes and
complains that every bit of information he gives out gets twisted:
Disgruntled players plastered Web sites and discussion rooms
with questions, conspiracy theories and a mock game called Treasure
Quash. At least one man logged a complaint with Internet Fraud
Watch.
Beckett said he assumed the game was legitimate because of the
accolades and media hoopla. But problems soon emerged when the
Treasure Quest mastermind, Cerise Casper of Washington, sued Sirius
Publishing over a contract dispute. Before that case was settled
for an undisclosed sum, Casper reportedly made computer contact
with Treasure Quest participants.
DALLAS For a brief moment yesterday afternoon, Houston Rockets
center Hakeem Olajuwon allowed himself to wonder how different his
career would have turned out had Michael Jordan been his teammate.
Before the 1984 NBA draft, Ray Patterson general manager of
the Rockets came close to trading Ralph Sampson to Chicago for
the third pick of the '84 draft, which belonged to the Bulls. The
Rockets used the top pick that year to take Olajuwon.
The Bulls used the third pick to draft Jordan. Just imagine how
the NBA landscape would have changed had Olajuwon and Jordan been
teammates.
Olajuwon was in Dallas at Don Carter's All-Star Bowling Lanes to
participate in a celebrity bowling tournament staged by Holy Land
Foundation. The foundation helps raise money for orphan
sponsorships, the homeless and scholarship programs.
