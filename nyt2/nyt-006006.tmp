For Woods, there is the occasional death threat, which he shrugs
off as would any world-famous 22-year-old. There are kids working
for collectors and collectors working for themselves. In the middle
of it, there are also kids just trying to catch a glimpse of him,
just to say they did.
It's also hard to imagine what could compel grown men to fire
their bodies into a crowd, through children, in search of a name
written on a piece of paper, but it takes all kinds.
The police are with him all the way, every week. Without them,
he would be swallowed up, submerged inside a great clump of
humanity and carried away to a secret location filled with nothing
but felt pens and 8x10 glossies.
In reality, Woods is the main story. He always is. Every
tournament, every round, every hole, nobody in golf is watched more
closely. To the people who tune in only for the majors, Woods is
the show. Every golfer and every spectator is aware of his
presence, even if he does come to the Olympic Club as a prohibitive
underdog.
The official dossier on Woods indicates a style that is not
suitable to winning a U.S. Open. His swashbuckling play is
apparently at odds with the calculated shot-making needed to excel
on a mind-numbing course such as Olympic.
As Jack Nicklaus suggested Tuesday, maybe Woods doesn't yet
deserve to be showered with expectations. Maybe it's not his turn.
Still, it sounds strange to hear that Woods' ability to hit the
ball a long way is actually a disadvantage. Woods doesn't
understand this, either; he seems to find it logical to assume that
if a man can hit the ball a long, long way off the tee, he probably
can throttle it down through club choice and etc. and manage to
hit it a little shorter.
Besides, although the course is the shortest U.S. Open course,
we're not talking about windmills and alligators.
Everyone else might be right. The circumstances might favor the
patient plodding of Mark O'Meara or Tom Lehman, but who would you
rather watch? Woods might finish 11th, but he'll be easy to find.
Just look for the group of grown men using 6-year-olds as ladders.
McCurry used the occasion to voice the administration's
strongest protest to date over the stalled nomination of San
Francisco philanthropist James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg.
The nomination to the relatively inconsequential post is emerging
as a high-profile battleground over gay rights.
The comments came a day after Lott told an interviewer that he
believes engaging in gay sex is a sin and a problem to be solved.
