The case the first jury verdict on same-sex harassment in
Massachusetts comes on the heels of a US Supreme Court ruling in
March that federal law prohibiting gender bias applies to same-sex
harassment.
Dottie Wackerman, vice president of communications for Norton,
would not comment on details of the case.
Wackerman said Norton has filed post-trial motions claiming the
evidence did not support the verdict and aiming to reduce the
judgment. Depending on the outcome of those motions, she said, an
appeal may be filed.
Eight women and four men in May awarded $843,313 in damages and
interest, plus undetermined legal fees which could put the
settlement close to $1 million.
The harassment, he claimed, began with an unwelcome advance
outside the workplace. A few days later, Trafecante told him he
loved him and wanted to have sex with him, according to court
papers.
The harassment increased with time. Trafecante allegedly began
following him into the men's room, made sexual gestures in the
company gym, and once grabbed his genitals, Belanger claimed.
After Trafecante was suspended in 1994, Belanger was admitted to
the psychiatric ward at Memorial Hospital in Worcester for a week,
and did not return to work that summer.
Fate intervenes when the neighboring Huns invade. The emperor
(Pat Morita) decrees that every family must send one male to the
country's defense. Mulan's father, a war hero, is willing but
hardly able. He's elderly and infirm. So she pulls a National
Velvet cuts her hair, dresses like a guy and reports for duty.
But now she's in double jeopardy. Not only could she be killed,
but if her disguise is discovered, the law mandates that she be
executed by her commanding officer, who just happens to be an
inviting young hunk named Shang (B.D. Wong/Donny Osmond).
Good thing her ancestral spirits have sent along some
protection. Well, not protection so much as a disgraced little red
dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy), trying to prove himself worthy
of said spirits.
