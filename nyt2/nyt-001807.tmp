Yet the legal climate has changed, in large part, because home
schoolers have developed into a potent political and legal force.
Their association with the Christian right has earned them strong
Republican backing.
They are also very good at bare-knuckle, grass-roots politics.
The HSLDA has a staff of 50, including seven lawyers, who lobby on
Capitol Hill but also pick fights at the state level.
When a Michigan couple was arrested in 1985 for teaching their
child at home without a teacher's license, the HSLDA fought the
case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court, where the law
requiring home-schooling parents to be licensed teachers was struck
down as unconstitutional.
Farris boasts that he can generate 100 telephone calls to every
congressional office within a matter of hours.
At the same time, public opinion on home schooling has shifted.
When the Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup poll on public attitudes towards
education first asked about home schooling in 1985, 73 percent of
those surveyed said it was a bad thing, compared with 16 percent
who approved.
When the same question was asked in 1997, the objectors had
fallen to 57 percent and the supporters had more than doubled, to
36 percent.
But what happens to the children? The HSLDA claims that, on
average, home-schooled students outperform their public-school
peers by more than 30 percentage points in all subjects, and that
the longer a child is schooled at home the larger the test gap
grows.
The figures may be tilted, and home-schooled students, whose
parents are an exacting bunch, would probably do well in public
schools too. Still, home schooling is not creating a generation of
dullards.
Illingworth has challenged the movement to find a better name,
since many of its most successful students have taken some courses
in public schools and even in community colleges. The picture of a
mother working with her children around the kitchen table does not
do justice to the idea, he says.
And there is a harder question: is it possible to develop
socially without ever going to school?
