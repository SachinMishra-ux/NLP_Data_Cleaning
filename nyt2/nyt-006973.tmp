Replacing the iron only takes money. The Japanese make excellent
irons to fit the Record planes, and so does the small American
maker Hock. You can also improve them considerably by getting all
the slop out of the adjustment screw, but you'll need a better
expert than myself to explain that.
Incidentally, the Marples chisels will need similar work. The
back (edge side) of the chisel is just like the sole of a plane; it
has to be flat and square to the sides. The Marples tools won't be.
Once again, silicon carbide powder and water on a piece of heavy,
flat glass are called for.

SALAMANDER-POEM AUSTIN U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin

HELLER-COOKBOOK The lazy days of summer arrive officially next
week, so we went looking for cookbooks that are a good read. We
wanted more than just a collection of recipes. (Heller, Dayton
Daily News) MOVED.
BEER-MSKUBE Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical
7-ounce glass with no ornamentation. (Skube, Atlanta

FOOD-RECIPESWAP Frances Bowie recently e-mailed Recipe Swap
looking for the Mix-Easy Two Egg Cake recipe from the cookbook and
manual that came with her Dormeyer mixer in 1948. Luckily, there
were a handful of pack rats out there who pulled out their Dormeyer
mixer manuals from around the same time and found the recipe. And
readers Dorothy Barr and Ruth Eunice, both of Atlanta, reported
their mixers were still working. (Recipe follows.) (Walker, Atlanta
