Predictably, Gordon's quick rise to the top of the sport has
provoked a regular swirl of rumors around the garages, from the
outrageous to the comic: his tires are pressure-coated with a
microscopically ground titanium dust; his car uses rocket fuel; he
and NASCAR officials have conspired to script how the racing season
would unfold, with Gordon winning his third championship in
dramatic fashion in the fall.
Gordon said there is no credence to the rumors. But he can sort
of understand the ones about his car. For one thing, it is almost
always the fastest. Another is that his team was caught with
illegal hubs a few years ago.
If people don't like him because of his success, Gordon said, he
can live with that. If they don't like him because of who he is,
well, he will find a way to live with that, too.
WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. Kathleen Devigne moved here 15 years ago
from the Bronx, where her fear of crime had kept her close to home.
In this bustling downtown of wide sidewalks and plentiful shops,
she found an ideal blend of city convenience and suburban peace of
mind.
But now Mrs. Devigne, an 83-year-old widow who never learned to
drive, says she is facing a new threat to her independence: the
closing of the last neighborhood supermarket.
But to the store's customers, many of them elderly women like
Mrs. Devigne who do not drive and depend on stores within walking
distance, the store's closing meant the loss of one more bit of
freedom.
Though Mrs. Devigne (pronounced de-VEEN) broke two wrists in a
fall last year, she is healthy and now plans to walk a little
farther to shop at the Food Emporium a mile from her home.
White Plains has long been a destination for many elderly Bronx
residents who wanted to live in what they considered to be a safer
place where driving a car was not a necessity, said White Plains
Planning Commissioner Michael Graessle. The city is the seat of
Westchester County government and home to two big malls, the
Westchester and the Galleria. Shoppers and workers make the city's
population swell to an average of 250,000 during the day, but
according to the 1990 census, only 48,718 people live in White
Plains. More than 20 percent, or 10,147, are 60 or older, and 3,139
are widowed, Graessle said.
That percentage of people 60 or older compares with 16.8 percent
of the population nationally and 17.7 percent statewide.
In downtown White Plains, the percentage of elderly residents is
even higher, with about 22 percent of the 11,392 residents 60 years
old or older.
