JEWS-SOUTH (Jackson, Miss.) -- Although Jews have disappeared
from dozens of villages in the Baptist-dominated Bible Belt, Jewish
communities are thriving in cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte,
N.C., Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans. Memphis is the home of the
largest Orthodox congregation in the country. By Curtis Wilkie.

VENNOCHI-COLUMN (Boston) -- Hide the Big Dig? Put the Garden

Joan Vennochi.
MUSIC-LYRES (Undated) When the Lyres are on Jeff Conolly
playing his Vox Continental one-handed, shaking a tambourine with

BOOK-RUSSIA (Undated) In three rugged months spent fly-fishing
from Murmansk to Magadan and beyond, Fen Montaigne plunges into the
method and madness of an addictive world he has come to love

Inquirer. By Lynnley Browning.
RAC-NH-SWEEPS (Salem, N.H.) Without a win since last year, OK
By Me has an excellent chance to get back on track over a surface
he relishes. By Ron Indrisano.
Perhaps, newcomer Christoper Scott Cherot, who wrote, directed,
and stars in the failed screwball comedy, should have found one job
he was good at, and stuck with it. He's spread himself too thin,
and just about every seam shows, with often clunky dialogue, flat
direction, and airless performances, save for Tammi Katherine
Jones's hilarious film debut, as one of the women eager to jump the
bones of Cherot's Lee Plenty.
Lee is a would-be writer with a monster case of writer's block.
He's also homeless at the moment, resigned to keeping a roof over
his by housesitting and visiting friends. One of those friends is
Havilland Savage (Chenoa Maxwell, saddled with as absurb movie name
as you'll find), who is attractive, rich, and engaged to a annoying
boyfriend Michael (Hill Harper), an annoyingly pompous singer on
that rub-you-down, quiet storm R'n'B tip.
Still, all of this might have been disgestible had Cherot not
resorted to the creaky tactic of speaking directly to the audience a lot. With rare exception, this is a screenwriter's way of
plugging the plot holes and narrative failings his lack of
creativity could not. If a movie is any good, it usually doesn't
need one of the characters acting as the play-by-play announcer.
The film's conclusion and the title's a dead giveaway is
cheap and unbelievable, and has the audacity to attempt a Profound
Statement about an artist's integrity vs. commercial success. Yeah,
right.
