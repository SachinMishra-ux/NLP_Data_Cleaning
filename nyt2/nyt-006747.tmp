At least one Paris hotel had to call police to calm an irate
crowd of Brazilians whose promised tickets for the opening match 10
days ago had not appeared.
Police and prosecutors have opened investigations into possible
fraud that have already led to the arrest of two officials linked
to ISL Worldwide, the official marketing agency of the
international soccer federation, FIFA, which organizes the World
Cup.
The World Cup, held every four years, has turned into an
enormous business, with FIFA reaping large payments from the sale
of television rights and sponsoring contracts.
As the fever to get tickets for games has mounted, prices for
tickets have soared, with some reports suggesting that tickets for
the final on July 12 may fetch over $15,000 each. There appear to
be fortunes to be made on the black market, and advertisements have
begun to appear daily in newspapers from people seeking tickets.
To date, police and judicial investigations here have focused on
ISL France, the French subsidiary of ISL Worldwide, which is based
in Switzerland. The general director of the subsidiary, Marc
Loison, and a consultant, Gilles Favard, have both been detained by
police for questioning on the possible fraudulent sale of tickets.
The arrests followed a lawsuit filed by a French lawyer, Francis
Debacker, representing four Japanese tour operators who said they
had paid for 15,000 tickets that were promised by Favard but never
delivered. In theory, ISL France is supposed to market the World
Cup but not sell any tickets.
The sale of tickets was directed by France's central organizing
committee for the World Cup, which was further embarrassed Thursday
by reports that a confidential phone number leaked to a few
privileged fans allowed them to buy huge blocks of seats when
170,000 tickets were put up for sale on a first-come, first-served
basis on April 22.
Bruno Travade, a spokesman for the organizing committee, said
the committee had asked France Telecom, the country's main
telephone company, to conduct an investigation into the existence
of a secret number and would file charges if necessary.
Official phone lines were constantly busy when the tickets went
on sale, and newspapers here were full of calculations from
mathematicians putting the odds of getting through at one in
several million.
As the ticket scandal raged, police moved to stop trouble on
another front. The sale of alcohol around a Paris stadium, the Parc
des Princes, was banned during matches and for several hours before
and after them. During the Germany-U.S. game on Monday, a number of
German fans outside the stadium were arrested after minor clashes
with police.
