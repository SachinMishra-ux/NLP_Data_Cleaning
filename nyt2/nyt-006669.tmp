The second reason to despise the thugs is that they are used as
an excuse to scorn soccer back in the United States. Apparently it
is easier for television news editors and newspaper headline
writers to document English criminals and racists than it is to
portray Nigerians running the fast break or Brazilians charming the
host country.
The third reason to despise the thugs is that they jeopardize
the carnival mood of this World Cup. The organizers in Toulouse
have had to cancel their summer-solstice music festival Sunday
night because they fear the jackals waiting in the weeds for the
next England game Monday.
What a shame, because the hosts have planned such nice parties.
The other day I went to Copacabana Beach in Nantes, the old city on
the Loire estuary, where hosts trucked in tons of sand so young
people could play beach soccer, so elegant women from Cameroon
could sell T-shirts and artwork, so Moroccan entrepreneurs could
sell Middle Eastern sweets.
Out in the main square, there was a motorcade of Moroccan fans
(men and women together), horns honking, flags waving, marching and
cheering, joined by Brazilians and Japanese and French and Scots
and Americans and Cameroonians, all linking arms.
Meanwhile, in Marseille, they were cleaning up the mess from
their English visitors, who had gone into that hard southern port
city, looking to stir up trouble among the large Middle Eastern
community.
Don't get this wrong. These marauders are not homeless or
jobless or marginal people. A number of studies have shown that
these are men from their teens into their 40s who work all week
while plotting military-style maneuvers, trapping and wounding
blacks or Pakistanis or Indians or Jews or women or some toff whose
face annoys them.
I could make my guesses about the cause the monarchy, the
none-too-subtle divisions of accent and school and neighborhood and
ancestry.
Any American knows we've got more than our share of malevolence
back home, but nobody has ever linked one sport with planned
violence. It is not the fault of the sport itself, obviously, but
the question is, can these people be identified and stopped?
While Marseille was trembling, the English sent over a security
official who spoke excellent French and lectured on the Rights of
Man, on Liberte, Fraternite, Egalite. I almost expected him to
break out singing the Marseillaise.
In a way, he was right. In the new European Community, people
can cross the old borders with fewer restrictions than the past,
the price for cheaper wine and cheese. After several decades of
death and violence around soccer games, English officials have
tried to limit the most notorious thugs from traveling, but it's
not working, or else the malaise is deeper than they imagined.
