The maladies were the type that screamed out for increased
flexibility torn quadriceps, herniated disk in his back, strained
groin, torn cartilage in his knee, torn ligament in his thumb.
Don't assume, however, that Gonzalez now spends his spare time
visiting one of those snack tables in the clubhouse.
Just as much work as before, but with a vastly different
emphasis: stretching and light weights.
McGwire attracts hordes when he takes batting practice, because
his hitting stroke is the type that takes the breath away dead
pull, uppercut, launching balls to the deepest reaches of the
left-field seats.
When Gonzalez stepped into the cage before a game with the
Angels on Friday afternoon, it generated barely a ripple of
excitement. Here's why: His first 17 cuts produced hits up the
middle or to right field, with only one ball carrying the wall. Low
liners jumped off his bat and threatened to leave dents in the
right-center wall.
A couple of hours later, on a low-and-away fastball that the
Angels' Chuck Finley had appeared to spot perfectly, Gonzalez
lashed a double into the right-center gap that cleared the bases.
By all accounts, the maturity is clearly evident in this former
mercurial and reckless young man. Being divorced three times by age
28 is sure to weather anyone.
The words reflect the brimming optimism of a guy who has gone
nearly three months in a rigorous sport without missing a day's
work.
LOS ANGELES My father is a formidable figure, with a booming
voice and a personality that eclipses his 6-foot-2 frame. People
who meet him assume he once ran interference for a hotshot tailback
at some prestigious university. But World War II shot down my
father's college plans and his athletic career.
That's not why my dad went to extraordinary ends to spring me,
his firstborn, for gains so great they're still being measured. He
wasn't living vicariously through my athletic endeavors, just
evening a score.
