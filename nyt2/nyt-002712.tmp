Everyone knew this would be a one-run game, or if not, an
extra-inning game all six games here between the Giants and Cards
have been exactly that. After the Cardinals put runners on second
and third and no outs against Nen, it looked like the Cardinals,
losers of eight out of nine, would steal a win.
But Nen struck out Ray Lankford and intentionally walked McGwire
to load the bases. After a force out by Brian Jordan, Nen ended it
by getting John Mabry to bounce into a force play.
The site, at www.schwab.com/chinese, is Schwab's latest effort
in a longtime strategy to build its Asian American clientele by
providing bilingual brokers, materials and telephone services.
Schwab also has opened five branches nationwide, including two
in the Bay Area, to cater to Asian Americans by providing bilingual
brokers and materials.
Schwab's Asian-language branches are located in San Francisco's
Chinatown, Milpitas, the Los Angeles suburbs of Rowland Heights and
San Gabriel, and Flushing, N.Y. There are plans to open new
branches in Daly City and Seattle later this year.
Other financial companies are trying to catch up with Schwab.
Merrill Lynch has Asian-language offices in New York and the Los
Angeles area. PaineWebber Inc. also has an office in Flushing that
focuses on Asian Americans.
Fidelity Investments has launched a pilot program to try and
target Asian American investors by providing bilingual brokers over
the telephone and at some investor centers across the western
United States, including San Francisco.
Chinese-speaking customers can get quotes, check their account
balances and make trades on Schwab's new Web site, which also has
several links to the company's English-language site.
The site is being promoted by Schwab's Asian investment centers,
and by ads in Chinese media. But the most effective marketing tool
will be satisfied customers, Louie said.
Many Asian American investors already do business in English,
but Schwab wanted to provide as many options possible to make
investing less stressful, Louie said.
