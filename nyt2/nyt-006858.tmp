In the shooting case, the offender, Frank Penna, was convicted
of kidnapping and rape in 1976. He has been out on parole since
1992. Under the New Jersey law, offenders who have been out of
prison for up to 15 years are still subject to community
notification requirements.
Penna's neighbors had no reason to believe him a danger until
they were notified of his criminal record two weeks ago. The threat
he poses to the community is theoretical. But the bullets
apparently meant for him were very real. They could easily have
injured or killed his neighbors. That irony should not be lost on
those who think notification promotes public safety without also
exacting a cost.
SEATTLE The Asian flu is bearing down on Boeing and could cost
the company 90 commercial jet orders over the next five years. But
the Asia-Pacific region will regain long-term economic health,
remaining the world's largest market for passenger airplanes,
Boeing's vice president for marketing predicted Thursday.
Boeing's annual look 20 years into the future shows that
Asia-Pacific airlines will buy 4,760 new commercial jets, worth
$427 billion. That's compared with $332 billion worth of aircraft
from North America and $345 billion in Europe. China alone is
expected to buy 1,800 new aircraft worth $125 billion over the next
two decades.
He said several Asian airlines have requested help from Boeing
in financing new airplane orders and some have postponed taking
delivery of their new jets because they can't afford them.
He said some Asian economies will fall into a recession in the
next 12 to 18 months, though historical growth trends will return
in four or five years.
But he said Asian carriers likely will buy 150 fewer airplanes 90 from Boeing and 60 from rival Airbus Industrie over the next
five years because of slower growth in the current downturn. He
based his prediction on the assumption that Boeing will retain its
traditional 60 percent of the worldwide jetliner market.
Sixty of the Boeing deliveries to be affected will be widebody
aircraft such as the 747 jumbo jet, the 767 and the 777, all of
which are built in Everett.
Because of the reduced demand for widebodies, Boeing recently
announced it will lower monthly production of its largest model,
the jumbo 747, to 3.5 in mid-1999 from five currently.
Published annually by Boeing, the 20-year forecast is used by
the company's customers and suppliers to gauge future growth in the
industry.
