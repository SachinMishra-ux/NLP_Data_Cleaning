It might be boorish. It might be immensely politically
incorrect. But for U.S. soccer, it's a captive audience. And
there's no 10-run rule.
ALBANY, N.Y. Gov. George Pataki began the year with a modest
list of things he wanted out of the Legislature: end parole for
violent felons, permit charter schools, allow casino gambling,
toughen penalties for juvenile criminals.
He got none of those. But while the 1998 legislative session,
which ended Friday, may look like a bust for the Republican
governor, it gave him a few handy issues to use as he runs for
re-election this year, particularly the timeworn theme that
Democrats are soft on crime.
He signaled as much in a news conference on Friday afternoon in
which he reviewed a session that was widely seen as one of the
least eventful in memory. Pataki bemoaned the gridlock in the
Capitol, and blamed the Democrats who control the Assembly.
Pataki's political advisers calculated that there was not much
he needed, politically, from this session, and they may have been
right. Polls show him with huge leads over his Democratic rivals,
and the governor seemed to spend more time this year touring the
state to promote his record than working in the Capitol to enhance
it.
Even his allies in the Legislature say that except for the
parole issue, he did not break a sweat this year lobbying for his
agenda.
He can tell communities in western New York and the Catskills
that see casinos as their best hope for economic development that
he tried, but he did not push the issue hard enough to raise the
ire of conservatives who oppose gambling. And he can tell minority
communities that favor charter schools that he fought their fight,
only to be thwarted by the Assembly's top Democrats, though the
Republicans who control the Senate were in no hurry to go down that
road, either.
In a way, it was a year made for political posturing, and not
just because of the coming election. In years past, lawmakers often
hitched smaller issues to larger ones, giving them leverage to get
more things done.
But this year, for the first time since Pataki was elected in
1994, there were no momentous issues hanging over the lawmakers'
heads, no budget crisis, no plan for deep cuts, no rent controls
ready to expire, no deadline for welfare reform. As legislators
noted repeatedly all year, there was nothing that, for either side,
absolutely had to be done.
In the final days of the session, there were a few notable
pieces of legislation passed, including one requiring that people
infected with HIV be reported to the state Health Department and
their sexual partners be notified. Lawmakers also agreed on a
program of inspections and emissions testing for heavy trucks and
buses, something long sought by environmentalists. And a deal was
struck on the management of the new Hudson River park in Manhattan
that places some limits on development along the river.
