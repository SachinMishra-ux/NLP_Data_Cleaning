Jordan has a sparse Game 7 resume, which is to his credit. His
teams have been so dominant that there have been only two seventh
games in the seven-year Chicago run. They are, of course, 2-0.
So hear this, and hear it well: William F. Russell would come
out of nowhere to block a Michael Jordan shot just as easily and
just as frequently as he did to Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Oscar
Robertson, to name three of the many NBA players of the '60s who
could step into the NBA today to make All-Star teams.
And hear this: Sam Jones was a better guard than any current NBA
backcourt player not named Michael Jordan. Yeah, that includes Gary
Payton, Penny Hardaway, and anyone else you can name.
And this: Before there was Scottie Pippen, there was John
Havlicek, who never had to come out of a game and who, at age 37,
shut off a prime-of-life Dr. J in the 1977 playoffs.
The big difference between the '60s and the '90s is the coaching
approach, not necessarily the inherent athletic ability. Everything
is geared to defense today. In Russell's third championship season,
1960, the Celtics averaged 120 shots a game. In Jordan's six
championship seasons, the Chicago annual average is 86. The fewest
shots averaged by a Russell title team were 101 in 1968-69. The
game concept was entirely different.
The modern defenses are more complex and sophisticated. Russell Co. had scouting reports and a memory bank. Jordan and Friends
have videotapes and computer printout tendencies. Meanwhile,
offenses are more cautious the fast break has almost disappered
as an art form and the players, however athletic, are woefully
incomplete once you take away their Plan A. The old guys were more
well-rounded basketball players. The modern defenses are combating
more and more players who really don't know how to play. Have
Russell anchor one of today's defenses and he would be even more
devastating. How about that?
 Bill Russell and Michael Jordan are the two greatest
demonstrated winners in American team sport history. On sport's Mt.
Olympus, they occupy the two finest houses.
What was the poetry like? Several hundred poems are sitting in
the Sexton archive in Texas, mostly unread until now. A few of the
poems are very good, and were later published in literary journals
like the Yale Review, the Hudson Review, and the American Scholar.
Most of the poems were student quality, some good enough to publish
in the hospital newsletter. And some were just blots, words
scrawled on paper by men and women shocked, both literally and
figuratively, onto the verges of catatonia.
Perhaps better than her student Plunkett, Sexton, who had
already attempted suicide, understood how close to the precipice
some of her students were standing. Several wrote about their
suicide watches. One not-untypical fragment:
Perhaps inevitably, the intensely self-critical and depressive
Sexton viewed the seminar as a failure. In December 1973 she
gathered some of the McLean poems and notes into a manila folder
and scrawled a note in felt-tipped pen on the outside cover:
