Durant was the only player who reached five under par Thursday,
but then double-bogeyed No. 14. Danger lurked at every hole.
Olympic features a brutal start. No. 3, No. 4 and No. 5 are ranked
the second, third and fourth hardest holes on the course
respectively. Get through that stretch, and you are still faced
with the rough and the tiny greens. And Thursday's pin placements
were difficult.
But Thursday night, Stewart could rest more easily than most. He
had one good day in the bank. And that was more than many others
could say.
ELMONT, N.Y. The best fillies in the East including last
year's champion and two arriving with five-race winning streaks will compete at Belmont Park Saturday in the Hempstead Handicap,
running a mile and one-sixteenth for a purse of $250,000 and a
major credential in the race for division honors.
The champion is Ajina, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Distaff
last November and the Eclipse Award as the 3-year-old filly
champion. She will be the overnight favorite at 6-5 for her
trainer, Bill Mott, and her jockey, Mike Smith. But Ajina will have
to outrun Glitter Woman, trained by Shug McGaughey with Jerry
Bailey riding and a record that shouts. In 13 of her 15 starts,
Glitter Woman has run first or second.
Ajina and Glitter Woman, who have each earned more than $1
million, should get a run for their money from the two fillies
coming into the Hempstead with the five-race winning streaks:
Colonial Minstrel, who has run in the money 12 times in 14 starts,
and Mossflower, a daughter of Affirmed, who has started just five
times but won them all. And everybody will be keeping an eye on the
two fillies who complete the field, Dixie Flag and Royal Indy, both
trained by Allen Jerkens.
Mossflower will be running her first stakes race, and her
trainer, Richie Schosberg, sees nothing but class in her path.
This evil is insidious, like all the worst evils: vampires,
lobbyists, the bubonic plague. It moves with utmost stealth,
thrives on lack of vigilance. Relax for an eye's blink, and boom.
Somehow, niceties like that, the real fallout from the 1970s,
get skipped by those rejoicing over hiphuggers, tube tops and Kool
and the Gang. We also don't hear much about that other legacy of
the Disco Age.
I am speaking of Richard Nixon and Watergate, of 1974 and his
plane out of D.C. Three Mile Island, the Bee Gees, polyester mercifully, those afflictions came and went. But nothing has
stitched the tear between politicians and people.
The 1970s brought us all that. Thus, the decade begs for
execution. Instead, its corpse keeps jumping up for one more chance
to do The Hustle. A MERCY KILLING
