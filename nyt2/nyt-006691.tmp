Certainly Japan does not have the feel of a country in a severe
downturn. There are few homeless people, soup kitchens,
bankruptcies or vacant buildings. Although there are some
differences in measurements, the record unemployment rate in Japan
is still 4.1 percent, less than the 4.3 rate in the United States.
An old saying defines a recession as when your neighbor is laid
off. When you are laid off it is a depression. By those
definitions, for the great majority of Japanese this is still not a
recession.
The gulf in perceptions inside and outside Japan on the
seriousness of the economic situation here is difficult to
exaggerate.
To Americans and many Asians these days it sometimes seems that
Japan's economy is burning and is threatening to ignite all of Asia
and, perhaps, the United States and Europe, as well. For those
fearing a global economic conflagration, nothing is more
infuriating than the sight of Hashimoto passively watching the
flames and seeming to do little more than blithely insisting that
the fire will eventually subside.
In a similar situation Nero fiddled, but not for eight years that is the kind of grumbling one hears from U.S. officials these
days.
To Japanese officials the foreign carping seems foolish and
petulant. Some say the U.S. government is simply nervous about its
own bubble economy and is looking for a scapegoat to blame when
stock prices inevitably collapse. And most Japanese say the risks
are exaggerated.
Moreover, many Japanese insist that their country is seriously
addressing the recession and the Asian crisis. They note that the
Japanese government has begun a huge stimulus package, the biggest
in the nation's history, and that the government has contributed
far more to Asian bailouts than the United States.
In any case, for all the bewilderment and anger at Japan's
reluctance to do more to stimulate its economy, Hashimoto's
behavior, viewed from a Japanese perspective, makes some sense and
appears in keeping with the public mood. After all, he just
celebrated the Liberal Democratic Party's latest victory, on Sunday
in a parliamentary by-election.
That was the sixth consecutive victory in by-elections for the
Liberal Democrats, and polls suggest that they will also do very
well in elections for the upper house on July 12. The upper house
is much less significant than the lower house, but the election
will nonetheless be an important test of sentiment, and Hashimoto
seems ready to pass with flying colors.
A poll this week in the Yomiuri newspaper, taken just before the
intervention to support the yen, found that the support for
Hashimoto's government had fallen, to 30 percent. But perhaps more
important, 29 percent of those interviewed said they still
supported the Liberal Democrats, compared to 5.5 percent for the
leading opposition group, the Democratic Party.
