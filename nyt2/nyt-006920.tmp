The better question is whether she can really change things if
she does win. For all the angst over the economy, there is
tremendous grass-roots resistance to economic reform.
In 1997, Cayetano and legislative leaders convened an Economic
Revitalization Task Force made up of government officials, business
leaders and organized labor. Months later, the group returned with
proposals for reducing the cost of doing business, streamlining the
regulatory process, boosting tourism and improving the public
schools.
Some changes were made, including a big cut in the personal
income tax, but much of the package was torn up.
The Hawaiian economy has not fallen off the cliff. But it has,
after climbing for decades, reached a long plateau. The state grew
at an average rate of 4.4 percent between 1959 and 1990.
The Sonics trailed the Los Angeles Lakers at halftime in Game 4
of the Western Conference semifinals. Even more frustrating, they
were getting walloped in the series on their way to playoff
elimination.
So Payton exploded in the locker room and in the face of
former coach George Karl, who barked back. The scene reflected the
type of confrontations (usually over game-plan disagreements) that
Karl and Payton engaged in several times last season, seemingly
many times during their relationship.
The Sonics went on to lose that game 112-100. Payton followed
the tirade with an explosion on the court 31 points, 13 assists
and eight rebounds in 41 minutes yet his monster game did not
translate into a victory. One loss later, Karl was finished as
Sonics coach.
If Paul Westphal did not know already, he has a clue now.
Westphal, who was named the Sonics' new coach Wednesday, must get
more out of Payton in subtle ways than his predecessor did.
Karl struggled with his point guard from start to finish.
Veteran Sonic players complained privately that Karl established
rules such as players must practice to play then let Payton
bend them with impunity. They also complained that Payton sometimes
strayed from Karl's game plans or would sometimes distance himself
from his teammates in critical moments of games when his leadership
was needed.
After the Sonics were dropped from the postseason, Karl met with
president Wally Walker to discuss the team's future. One of Karl's
suggestions was that the Sonics should be open to the possibility
of trading Payton for several players if the team experienced more
second-round jolts. It was the second time in four years that Karl
made such a plea.
