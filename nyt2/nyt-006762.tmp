Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot's feature debut
manages to subvert those expectations, but for the most part is low
on originality. It mainly proves that African-American filmmakers
are just as proficient at aimless romantic navel-gazing as their
white colleagues.
A stylish name-dropper, Havilland mentions parties with Eddie
Murphy and Quentin Tarantino. She's just broken up with a rising
pop musician (Hill Harper) who makes other women swoon.
Lee's life, in contrast, is far from glam. A writer whose latest
book deal has fallen through, he lives in friends' apartments and
scrapes by as a teacher's assistant at New York University.
Down in D.C., in a house that proves to be the movie's
claustrophobic primary location, we meet Hav's arch friend Caroline
(Tammi Katherine Jones) and sister Leigh (Robbine Lee).
Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have the movie
star wattage or sly charm his role needs. Maxwell can't do much
with her character, written as a chilly and sour woman.
Don't expect any mention of Atlanta or any of the Georgia
characters in this excerpt, however. They won't appear until
October, when the next two chapters are published in Rolling Stone
and Men's Journal.
Conrad, a young father with two children, is working the
$14-an-hour job in hopes of buying a condo. But he soon learns his
future at Croker Global Foods Warehouse is as precarious as the
footing on the ice-patched floor.
As Croker's financial woes intensify, Atlanta is thrust into a
racial crisis when Fareek Fanon, a young man who scratched his way
out of the slums to become a star college football player, is
accused of raping an Atlanta blue blood's daughter.
At this point in his life, however, Wilde (Stephen Frye) is
still very much in the closet even to himself. What many people
probably don't know, and what this movie manages to convey in its
Cliffs Notes way, is that he tried Victorian conformity. He marries
and has two children. But one night while his wife (Jennifer Ehle)
is upstairs in the nursery, a houseguest (Michael Sheen) introduces
Oscar to his true sexual inclination.
Disaster strikes when Oscar falls hard for handsome, heartless
Lord Alfred Douglas (Jude Law), a petulant brat with a title and a
tyrannical father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson).
Oscar's toxic infatuation leads to his becoming a pawn in a
poisonous struggle between a nasty son and a nastier father. The
result? Victorian England's trial of the century.
