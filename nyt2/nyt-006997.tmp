A. You are certainly on the right track and over the long term
you should do very well.
Still, you likely won't attain the retirement goal without
additional savings, and the purchase of your first house may be
closer to five years away than four.
Here's how I calculate. If you continue saving for retirement by
putting away $4,680 a year, you would amass $2,060,438 over 39
years, presuming average 10 percent annual growth. Invested to
produce an income stream (at a portfolio average 7 percent), you
could expect an income of $144,230 a year.
The trouble comes when you adjust for inflation. At 4 percent
average annual inflation, that $144,230 wilts down to the buying
power of $31,243 in today's money. If inflation averaged only 3
percent, the current value would be $45,541 still probably not
enough for a very comfortable lifestyle.
The good news is that you needn't fret. I suggest you calculate
the percentage of your current income that is going toward
retirement and then maintain that percentage during your working
years.
Thus, every time you get a raise, you bump your contributions to
the retirement pool. The result is that if your raises tend to
match or beat the inflation rate, you will thus be countering the
effect of inflation, and will indeed be very comfortably fixed in
retirement.
As for the house savings, I advise against moving to a mutual
fund, even an excellent one such as Vanguard Balanced Index. For
short-term savings, mutual funds are too aggressive; a market
downturn could take a serious bite out of your savings over the
short term.
I suggest you stick with money markets, CDs, US Treasury
securities, and the like for your home-purchase savings. If you
contribute $500 a month to this pool and achieve average annual
returns of 5 percent, over four years you would accumulate $28,883,
which is probably enough for a condo down payment; after five
years, you would have a more comfortable $36,464, which would widen
your purchase options and remember that the higher your down
payment is, the lower the interest rate you are likely to get on
the mortgage.
As for your 401(k) funds, it seems mostly solid, but I would
watch Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth fairly closely. After
excellent performance from 1992 to 1995, it fell to bottom-quartile
results the next two years. Its performance has improved this year,
but it is still running slightly behind the average for its mid-cap
growth peers.
If there are attractive alternatives in the small-cap or mid-cap
arena on your 401(k) menu, and if your fund doesn't soon return to
superior performance, I'd consider a change.
