Although the glider's design was later judged airworthy by
aviation experts, what might have been the most spectacular escape
of the war was made unnecessary by the arrival of American forces
in April 1945. As the Colditz guards watched in sheepish disbelief,
Welch and other prisoners showed off the glider in the castle
courtyard.
After the war Welch worked on rocket engines, then became a
gliding instructor and wrote several books on gliding.

No member of the defensive backfield is spared from trash
talking. The locker room is infused with his hearty laugh and
boastful jabs with teammates.
And fellow Cowboys receivers are straining to keep up with his
legendary workout regimen, which has included extra pass patterns
after practice to become familiar with coach Chan Gailey's new
offense.
Irvin, who is admittedly having an enjoyable and productive
off-season for the first time in two years, said he is motivated
for himself and his teammates.
Irvin declines to discuss the multitude of strife in 1996 and
1997 including him pleading no contest to felony drug possession
charges, being suspended for the first five games of 1996 for
violating the league's substance abuse policy and then enduring the
ordeal of being falsely accused of sexual assault in 1997 leading
to last season's retirement talk that kept him from the Cowboys'
past two off-season programs.
And strange as it may seem, the story with Irvin heading into
the start of Cowboys training camp July 15 in Wichita Falls has
been all about football and how productive he could be in Gailey's
new offense after substandard performances the past two seasons.
