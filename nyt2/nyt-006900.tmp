At the same time the West should do what it could to stabilize
Macedonia (offer aid in return for decent treatment of the ethnic
Albanians). But even this would probably be too little if the
interveners were not ready to get involved on the ground, as well
as in the air, to keep the peace.
That prospect is the nastiest of all for NATO, but, without it,
attacks on Kosovars would probably continue, the pledge to uphold
Serbia's integrity would be disbelieved and the bombing would be
seen as yet another empty western gesture. (To publish this excellent 1,000-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

It looks simple. The local thug is causing trouble again, this
time beating up his own people, not the neighbors. Last time, he
became cooperative only when the West, in the shape of NATO, showed
it meant business by carrying out air strikes.
It is now clear that if NATO had acted a lot earlier, Slobodan
Milosevic for the thug in question is the Serb nationalist who is
probably more to blame for the Balkans' wars than anyone else would have brought his Bosnian cousins to heel much sooner.
Thousands of lives would have been saved.
In Moscow this week, Milosevic was persuaded by Boris Yeltsin
that it would be prudent to listen to his critics and at least talk
to the people in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. Yet no one
should assume that this better behavior will last long.
Serb nationalists have a special reverence for parts of Kosovo,
notably the Field of Blackbirds, where their forebears' defeat at
the hands of the Ottomans in 1389 cast the Serbs into 500 years of
Muslim subjugation.
But this reverence for Kosovo does not extend to its people, 90
percent of whom are ethnically Albanian and mostly Muslim.
In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
