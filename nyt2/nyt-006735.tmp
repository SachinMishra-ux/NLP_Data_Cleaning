The measure would also give the Food and Drug Administration the
authority to regulate tobacco products and would curb tobacco
marketing to teens. However, it would not include the hefty price
increases that public health advocates say is necessary to
discourage teens from buying cigarettes.
On Wednesday, after four weeks of debate, a minority of senators
were able to avoid a straight up or down vote on the anti-tobacco
bill sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and effectively kill
the measure through parliamentary maneuvers.
The next day, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
signaled that his party intended to keep the issue alive by trying
to attach the anti-smoking bill to an unrelated appropriations
bill.
The effort failed. But Daschle sounded the theme echoed
throughout the day by fellow Democrats that tobacco industry
contributions to the GOP played a big role in the legislation's
demise.
At the White House, President Clinton suggested that the
Republicans had responded to a $40 million tobacco advertising
campaign which portrayed the bill as a big-tax, big-government
scheme.
But the president said that he had heard that a bipartisan group
of eight senators may be formed to try and salvage the anti-tobacco
initiative.
However, many of the extras tacked onto the bill had been pushed
by Lott's fellow Republicans, including Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,
who tied up the Senate for days over his proposal to cut taxes for
married couples.
Public health advocates, still reeling from the defeat of a bill
they have labored over for much of the year, also said they are
unlikely to support measures that do not substantially increase the
price of cigarettes.
They added that they plan to make the public aware of the 42
senators who helped bury the tobacco bill.
The public health organizations have spent about $2 million on
public relations campaigning, but have been far outspent by the
tobacco giants.
