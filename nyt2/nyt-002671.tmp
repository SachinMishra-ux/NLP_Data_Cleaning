The Dodgers appeared to blow open the game in the sixth when six
consecutive batters reached base against Moyer and five scored.
Konerko, who had four RBI on Saturday, highlighted the inning
with a bases-clearing double to right-center.
NEW YORK Larry Seabrook, a state senator from the Bronx who
had long planned to oppose Rep. Eliot Engel, a fellow Democrat,
said Sunday that he would not run for Congress this year but would
prepare for a congressional campaign in two years.
Seabrook's decision was an abrupt departure from the position he
has taken for nearly a year. Indeed, as recently as last week,
Seabrook said he had firmly decided to run against Engel and had
met with a host of politicians, fund-raisers and strategists to put
together a campaign against the five-term congressman.
In an interview Sunday, Seabrook, 46, said he had decided
against running, because he had failed to raise enough money and
because he had not seen a significant increase in the number of
registered black voters in the 17th Congressional District, which
covers the northern Bronx and parts of Westchester County. Seabrook
is black.
Seabrook had contended that the shifting demographics of the
district were creating a more receptive environment for his
candidacy against Engel, who is white. After the 1992
redistricting, the district's lines were redrawn to increase its
share of racial and ethnic minorities to nearly 70 percent: 38
percent black, 29 percent Hispanic, 29 percent white, 3 percent
Asian and 1 percent other.
Both Seabrook and Engel said the district's black and Hispanic
populations have grown since then. Luther Blake, a demographic
consultant, calculates that about 75 percent of the district's
population consists of members of minorities, while Seabrook
contends that the figure is closer to 80 percent.
Seabrook's decision came just days before the beginning of the
petitioning period, when candidates have to declare and file papers
indicating which offices they seek. It also came after meetings
with Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic chairman,
who has made the protection of his party's incumbents from
insurgent challenges the cornerstone of his stewardship.
Seabrook acknowledged that he had spoken with Ramirez, but
declined to discuss details of their conversation. Ramirez could
not be reached by telephone at his home Sunday and did not return
calls to his office.
Two weeks ago, Ramirez and the Bronx Democratic organization
averted what had been widely expected to be another turbulent
battle when Pedro Espada Jr., a former state senator who has been
in a heated feud with the party organization, announced that he
would not run for his former seat.
