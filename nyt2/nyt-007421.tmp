Dr. Sam Hamra is a plastic surgeon in Dallas who was a resident
with Aston at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. He said
he declined an invitation to participate in the experiment, and has
been critical of the study, which he called highly unusual.
Hamra reviewed the study at the time, and in an article that
appeared in the same issue in which the study was published, wrote
that the surgeons in the study failed to carry out the more
extensive surgical procedure properly. That is why so little
difference between the two face halves was noted afterward, he
said.
He said that after conversations with Aston and others, he
believed the patients were not fully briefed by the surgeons.
Aston said that any criticism by Hamra was suspect because Hamra
was a champion of the more aggressive procedure in face lifts.
Dr. Joel Feldman of Harvard University said that he recalled the
debate over the study when it was first presented, and was at the
time supportive of the work.
ALBANY, N.Y. Gov. George Pataki began the year with a modest
list of things he wanted out of the Legislature: end parole for
violent felons, permit charter schools, allow casino gambling,
toughen penalties for juvenile criminals.
He got none of those. But while the 1998 legislative session,
which ended Friday, may look like a bust for the Republican
governor, it gave him a few handy issues to use as he runs for
re-election this year, particularly the time-worn theme that
Democrats are soft on crime.
He signaled as much in a news conference Friday afternoon in
which he reviewed a session that was widely seen as one of the
least eventful in memory. Pataki bemoaned the gridlock in the
Capitol, and blamed the Democrats who control the Assembly.
Pataki's political advisers calculated that there was not much
he needed, politically, from this session, and they may have been
right. Polls show him with huge leads over his Democratic rivals,
and the governor seemed to spend more time this year touring the
state to promote his record than working in the Capitol to enhance
it.
Even his allies in the Legislature say that except for the
parole issue, he did not break a sweat this year lobbying for his
agenda.
