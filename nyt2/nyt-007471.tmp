The Newport Bermuda Race got off to a smooth start Friday
afternoon for the fleet of 161 boats that began the race in a
dwindling 7- to 9-knot southwesterly breeze off Newport, R.I.
Boomerang, the competition's record-holder, needs to finish in
less than 57 hours 31 minutes 50 seconds, the pace it set in the
635-mile voyage two years ago. Rima and Deep Powder, two new
60-foot yachts designed by Bruce Farr Associates of Annapolis,
Md., are favorites to win on corrected time under the International
Measurement System, the handicap racing division in which they are
competing.
The biennial competition draws both amateur cruising boats and
state-of-the-art race boats. Jim Mertz, an 87-year-old yachtsman
from Rye, N.Y., is competing in his 27th Bermuda race. He is
skipper of Symphony, a Beneteau 42.
Cable Wireless Adventurer, the odd-shaped, 115-foot powerboat
attempting to break a 83-day record around the world, is expected
to arrive in New York City around 8 a.m., Eastern time, on Tuesday.
The custom-made British boat left Gibraltar on April 19 in its
26,000-mile quest to beat a round-the-world time set in 1960 by the
nuclear-powered submarine the USS Triton.
It is expected to leave New York on Wednesday morning for the
last leg of its journey, a 3,000-mile trans-Atlantic voyage back to
Gibraltar. The powerboat will be docked at North Cove Yacht Harbor,
a marina near the World Financial Center.
Also at North Cove Yacht Harbor will be Young America, the
75-foot training boat for the New York Yacht Club's America's Cup
challenge in 1999-2000. The white-hulled sailboat was formerly
named Spirit of Unum, a trial horse in San Diego for the PACT `95
cup syndicate. It is expected in New York from Newport, R.I., on
Thursday, and will stay through July 4. It will take potential
donors and sponsors for a sail.
TOPEKA, Kan. A federal court jury on Friday rejected Bill
Koch's claims that two of his brothers defrauded him of as much as
$2 billion when he sold his stock in the family business, Koch
Industries of Wichita, Kan.
The jury's unanimous action ended an 11-week trial that drew
curiosity-seekers throughout and called into question the integrity
of the country's second-largest private company.
It also highlighted a 15-year feud between four brothers in one
of America's richest families: Bill, 57, and Frederick, 64, vs.
Charles, 62, and David, who is Bill's twin.
All are celebrities in their own worlds. Bill, a Palm Beach,
Fla., resident, won the America's Cup in 1992. Frederick is an art
dealer who lives in Monaco. Charles is the company's chief
executive officer and the only brother to remain in Wichita, where
they were raised. David is a vice president who operates in New
York's high society.
