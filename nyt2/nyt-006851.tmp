NEW YORK About 13,000 members of the largest union
representing New York City hospital workers rallied along Broadway
in midtown Manhattan on Thursday afternoon, vowing to strike if 35
private hospitals do not offer them a satisfactory new contract by
June 30.
Gathering in Central Park and marching down Broadway to an
elaborate soundstage erected in front of the Crowne Plaza Hotel on
48th Street the site of negotiations between the hospitals and
the union leaders of the march threatened a walkout by 50,000
workers in 35 hospitals if the hospitals do not accede to their
demands.
The two sides have been negotiating in the hotel for the last
two weeks. They held talks Thursday morning, suspended them during
the demonstration and resumed them Thursday evening. The two sides
are at odds over job security, a pay increase and potential
layoffs, among other issues.
Industry officials say the city's hospitals are underused and
have estimated that a staff reduction of more than 15 percent will
be needed in the next three to seven years. Union officials say
those estimates are exaggerated, and insist that through early
retirements, attrition and other means, large-scale layoffs can by
avoided.
The demonstration, which organizers said 22,000 people attended,
snarled traffic in midtown for several hours as police blocked off
at least 10 blocks of Broadway beginning at 3 p.m. But the
demonstrators, who assembled in Central Park at 3 p.m., did not
start marching down Broadway until after 5 p.m.
PHOENIX Randy Hinkle won the contest Thursday, but it's the
doctor who will make the final cut.
Hinkle was a virile competitor, nearly tipping his 15-horsepower
John Deere mower as he rounded the final turn, sputtering towards
the finish line at the course set up at Los Arcos Mall in
Scottsdale.
Other men watching the festivities would have raced to avoid a
vasectomy. But Hinkle, 42, was eager to claim the prize.
Hinkle bested two opponents, Jesse Mason and Chris Carlile, to
win his date with the doctor. The losers got KSLX-FM T-shirts as
consolation prizes.
Each day this week, the station is hosting a lawn mower contest,
buying the winner a vasectomy in honor of Father's Day.
