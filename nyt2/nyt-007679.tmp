On Sunday the Mets had to feel much the way Jackson did on that
star-crossed day. Yes, they enjoyed a 3-2 victory over the Florida
Marlins, wonderfully punctuated by a game-saving performance by
John Franco, who pitched the Mets out of a bases-loaded, no-outs
jam in the top of the eighth inning.
Franco celebrated by pumping his fist, thereby pumping up his
team. After the victory, however, the reliever did not hesitate to
take the team to task. He questioned the Mets for their inability
to salvage more from a stretch of games in which schedule makers
all but gift-wrapped game-winning opportunities against Florida and
Montreal, two of the weakest teams in the major leagues.
Sunday's victory was the Mets' lone moment of triumph in an
otherwise lost and debilitating three-game series against the
Marlins. That brought the Mets' now-completed 10-game run against
the Marlins and Expos to 4-6. That, the Mets know, is unacceptable.
And the big boys are coming, in the form of the underachieving
yet still potent Baltimore Orioles, who are host to the Mets Monday
night, and the last team the Mets could possibly want to see
during a time of struggle the Yankees.
Before looking ahead, though, the Mets might take time to
fitfully look back. If there had ever been a chance to convince
everyone, including themselves, that they are contenders as opposed
to pretenders, the Expos and Marlins presented it, tied up with
bright ribbons and bows.
Such soft spots in the schedule have to be taken advantage of,
if not feasted on. Other teams, when given the chance this season,
certainly have. Five teams have been presented with the enticing
opportunity to play the Expos and Marlins in consecutive series,
and the Mets have failed to exploit the situation as well as the
others.
Both the Cubs and the Brewers won six of seven and that was
before the Marlins further downsized to a minor-league caliber
franchise.
The Yankees, who have to revel in any favorable comparison to
the Mets, faced consecutive interleague series against the Expos
and Marlins and turned them into walkovers, winning five of six
games.
And no Met pretended that the famine turned into a feast, even
in victory Sunday, considering that one of the Mets' runs scored on
a walk, a hit and a groundout and another on an error, a walk and a
wild pitch. The offense remains missing in action.
Sunday's formula worked. Yet even though the Mets defeated the
rookie Joe Fonentot, who is without a victory in the major leagues,
they had to know it was not in a way that was close to being
palatable. Not when a pitcher who entered the game with an 8.14
earned run average pitched convincingly for seven innings,
something he had done only twice before this season and never above
Class AA.
