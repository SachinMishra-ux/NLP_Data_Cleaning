In fact, some other industry executives expect it to take
perhaps two years before there will be smart cards and related
hardware that will be impervious to Kocher's type of attack.
Kocher said he had approached the smart-card industry last year
with the details of his discovery because he knew that criminals
might also use the same tricks. But he said that he did not
publicize his findings, so that the industry would have time to
adopt defenses, including techniques for which he has filed for
patents and which he is now licensing to the companies.
Kocher's company, Cryptography Research, analyzes and tests
computer-security hardware and software for many of the leading
computer companies. His discoveries of flaws in supposedly secure
technologies have drawn attention in the past as in 1995, when he
found that he could break into smart cards by simply timing how
long it took them to process data.
In the case of this newly disclosed smart-card problem, Kocher
and his colleagues found that the cards' consumption of electrical
power could disclose vital information about the secret key that
protects the money or other data on the chip.
By watching the monitor of an oscilloscope, a device that
measures the power use on a screen similar to the way a cardiac
monitor displays a patient's heart action, Kocher's team was able
in some cases to use the electrical pattern from a single
transaction to decipher the key to the code. In other cases, they
were forced to use more sophisticated statistical techniques to
analyze the results from as many as 1,000 transactions.
Kocher said his team had spent at least as much time looking for
solutions as it had in identifying the security flaw. A possible
remedy involves masking the transaction in digital noise by adding
meaningless random calculations that would consume random amounts
of current.
Another possible solution, which according to Mastercard
officials is being incorporated in the latest version of its Mondex
smart-card software, is to vary the order of the operations in the
software to make it more difficult to identify patterns in the
consumption of power.
A banking-industry goal with smart cards is to cut costs by
eliminating the need for central approval of a debit or credit
transaction. By some estimates, the marginal costs for clearing a
smart-card transaction are well under a penny. Credit-card
transactions, however, typically require a long-distance computer
network and a large central database for examining each deal, and
the transaction eventually means billing a customer and cashing the
payment checks.
These steps add up to 25 cents a transaction, on average,
compared with about a penny for a smart-card transaction, in which
all the authorization information and even the money itself can
be contained on the card's chip.
Fletcher, of Mastercard's Mondex, contends that including any
sort of central control runs counter to the purpose of a smart card giving customers the ability to use the money on a card just like
cash.
