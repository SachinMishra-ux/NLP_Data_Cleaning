FEDERAL-DEBTS WASHINGTON A federal program that was supposed
to help collect debts that are owed the government has cost $40
million but brought in only $4 million, lawmakers complained at a
House oversight hearing Friday. Treasury officials offered few
assurances that they could make a big dent in the $52 billion in
non-tax related debts owed the U.S. (Malone, Cox News Service 500).
YORKTOWN-SURVIVORS WASHINGTON While ocean explorers from the

WILDE Directed by: Brian Gilbert Screenplay by: Julian Mitchell, based on Richard Ellman's
biography Starring: Stephen Fry, Jude Law, Vanessa Redgrave, Jennifer Ehle,
Gemma Jones, Judy Parfitt, Michael Sheen, Zoe Wanamaker, Tom
Wilkinsen Playing at: Kendall Square Cinema; Embassy Cinema, Waltham Running time: 116 minutes Rated: R (strong sexuality and language) 
The best thing about Fry's Wilde is his way of making us realize
that Wilde spent more time feeling than talking. He may have
exhibited a self-destructive streak in stubbornly chasing after the
wild, petulant, and emotionally and intellectually pinched Lord
Alfred Douglas, but Fry's reaction shots make a good case for the
fact that he was a steadfast and caring friend. That caring also
extended to his loyal and loving wife, even if he subordinated her
happiness and well-being, and that of his two children, to his
pursuit of young Douglas, nicknamed Bosie.
Nor does the film flinch from depicting, although not unendingly
or leeringly, a few convincing homosexual sex scenes. It was the
testimony of several so-called rent boys, after all, that sank
Wilde in his ill-advised suit against Bosie's vicious and
vindictive father, the marquess of Queensberry (the same man who,
ironically, invented the rules said to have civilized boxing). As
no other Wilde before him has done, Fry conveys with his eyes a
certainty that his arrogant and capricious young lover is going to
be bad news, and an equal certainty that he will pursue Bosie all
the same, even though it cost him everything.
Fry and director Brian Gilbert's biggest accomplishment is to
portray Wilde with dignity, even as he seems more than a little
ridiculous playing the fop. Jude Law moves a promising career yet
another step forward as the unscrupulous Bosie, utterly convincing
as a shallow but dangerous brat. Jennifer Ehle is another plus as
Wilde's wife, the aptly named Constance, who stood by her errant
husband. Michael Sheen is sympathetic as Wilde's first male lover,
the Canadian Robbie Ross, who returned Wilde's love. For a worldly
man, Fry's Wilde proceeds with prodigious blindness to the
consequences of thumbing his nose at the establishment, which stood
for it in his plays, but drew the line when in real life he
challenged its hypocrisy.
But Herlihy just doesn't fit the profile of the usual HAA
glad-hander. He can't remember making a donation since he graduated
from the World's Greatest University in 1980, and he thinks he may
be the first board member to have spent his Harvard years in the
once-radical Dudley Co-ops, off-campus cooperative housing in North
Cambridge.
Shortly before Herlihy was to begin his two-year term, HAA boss
Reardon phoned him in a tizzy. You're the wrong David Herlihy,
Reardon gasped. We meant to appoint David Herlihy of Hyannis, a
retired executive who spent 37 years at IBM. Ooops. Our David
Herlihy went to the first meeting anyway, met the real David
Herlihy, and surprise, surprise got the feeling that he wasn't
really wanted.
For years, the Eugene, Ore., couple known in cyberspace as Hubby
and Wifey had a little secret they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
