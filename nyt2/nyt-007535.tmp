Worse, the two sides are so entrenched that the NBA faces the
very real possibility of tarnishing its record as the only U.S.
professional sports league never to lose regular-season games to a
labor stoppage.
That's about as much as the two sides agree on, and that's bad
news for the league and for fans. Come July 1 the day free agents
are eligible to negotiate new contracts the owners will almost

The owners voted earlier this year to reopen the collective
bargaining agreement signed in 1995. Granik and Billy Hunter,
executive director of the players association, have met 10 times
since April 1, and are no closer to reaching agreement on the
fundamental issue the clause that allows teams to ignore the
salary cap when re-signing their free agents.
Granik and Hunter will meet again Monday in what could be a
make-or-break negotiating session.
When the players and owners signed the current pact and salary
structure in 1995, they agreed players would receive at least 48
percent of NBA revenues. This season the players' salaries totaled
57 percent, far exceeding the 51.8 percent trigger that allowed the
owners to reopen the agreement.
The league claims 14 to 15 teams will finish in the red this
year. The union claims the number is closer to four or five, and
the players association also notes that major-league baseball and
the NFL pay players 60 to 70 percent of revenues.

Gardner, were at the trailer where a 14-year-old girl lived with
