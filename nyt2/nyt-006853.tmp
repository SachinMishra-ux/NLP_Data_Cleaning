The conglomerate spun off TWA in 1983, after defeating a
takeover bid by Texas International Airlines, which was led by
Frank Lorenzo. TWA was eventually purchased by Carl Icahn in 1985.
Smart sold Transworld's hotel division in 1986, and liquidated
most of the assets to avoid an acquisition by Ronald Perelman, the
takeover investor and chairman of Revlon Inc. The resulting
company, called TW Services, was devoted to the food services
industry. Smart left in April 1987. In 1989, TW Services was
acquired by Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm.
Louis Edwin Smart graduated from Harvard University in 1947, and
Harvard Law School in 1949, both with magna cum laude degrees. He
joined Hughes, Hubbard Reed (then Hughes, Hubbard Ewing) that
year, and became a partner in 1957. During his tenure at the firm,
one of his major clients was Bendix Corp.
In 1964, Smart was named president of the international division
of Bendix, a position he held until he joined TWA as an executive
vice president in 1967.
In addition to his wife, Smart is survived by a daughter,
Cynthia S., of San Antonio; two sons, Dana G., of Long Beach,
Calif., and Douglas E., of Madison, Conn., and five grandchildren.
