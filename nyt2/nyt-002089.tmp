Indeed, Williams said two of the four riflemen in his unit who
were providing protection for him as he advanced to take out enemy
pill boxes were killed that day.
Williams fits the profile of many of the living recipients,
according to Jeanne Kirk, head of the Naval Operations Awards and
Special Projects Branch.
Still, the acts of valor for which they have been awarded the
Medal of Honor, especially since World War II, will always be set
apart from even the most impressive acts of bravery that now fall
short of the medal's criteria.
SAN FRANCISCO A transsexual trying to join San Francisco's
police force has filed a $3 million discrimination claim with the
city after her appeal of a failed psychological test was turned
down.
Cristiana Rivas, 38, received a notice from the Police
Department early this week that said an independent psychiatrist
upheld the department's findings that she was unfit for service and
was therefore disqualified.
But Rivas is convinced she was discriminated against, citing her
own psychiatrists' favorable evaluation, an eight-year stint in the
National Guard and six years as a top-level employee with the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as proof of her
qualifications.
Angry and frustrated, Rivas filed the $3 million claim with
Department of Human Resources' Equal Employment Opportunity
Division on Thursday and is working with her lawyer to put together
a lawsuit if her claim is denied.
The Police Department said it could not comment on why Rivas was
disqualified but spokesman Sherman Ackerson said the department
does not discriminate based on transgender issues.
But Rivas believes the department, or at least its
psychiatrists, are not comfortable dealing with transgender
applicants because they don't understand the issues. As an example,
Rivas said she was referred to as a cross-dresser during her final
evaluation with a city-affiliated psychiatrist who then asked her
to explain the difference between cross-dressing and transsexualism
when she objected.
Having fully expected to join the academy earlier this year,
Rivas quit her clerical job at ATF in January and is now on the
verge of having to sell her home because she has no income.
