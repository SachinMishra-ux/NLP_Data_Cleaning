What a breathtaking assertion. It means that whenever anyone
disagrees with him, Starr has a right to break the rules and become
an unnamed source for some journalist ready to convey his version
of the story. In politics, that is called spinning.
We all know that prosecutors leak. But Starr has been so
sanctimonious, so insistent that he never leaks.
In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province
of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain
ring of defiance, and no wonder.
Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer
career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising
the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated
bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the
restrictions from the beginning.
If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and
if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French
homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French
kitchen.
Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a
Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary
school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher
and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying
medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the
Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home
economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.
She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector
general in the French homemaking academy before French education
authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic
discipline.
By her own account Miss Mathiot garnered a total of seven
marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on
religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot
considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't
and bowed to her family's wishes.
After she established a life and career away from her family,
the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject
them, she said, though for reasons of her own.
If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home
economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim and a bit
of luck that led her from the backwaters of education to the
front burner of French cuisine.
