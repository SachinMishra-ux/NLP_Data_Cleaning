Nurses discussed the pattern of deaths with supervisors in April
and for several more months before action was taken, the lawsuit
said.
The hospital assigned another nurse to work with Williams in
August. But twice during the next week, when the other nurse called
in sick, patients of Williams died.
Williams was then transferred out of patient care, and he quit
the hospital in December 1993. He took a job at the Ashland
Healthcare nursing home in Ashland, Mo.
Williams, 32, has since moved from job to job in the St. Louis
area. He would not comment Friday but told a reporter last year he
didn't give Havrum any unauthorized medicine.
Kurtz declined to let a reporter interview Havrum or her three
children. Christensen said he can imagine the pain waiting has
caused Havrum's family.
At her house on the outskirts of Fulton, Helen Havrum is
literally surrounded by memories of her husband. He built the house
himself 32 years ago, and the tidy living room is filled with
pictures of him with his wife, children and grandchildren.
Helen Havrum stows some of her husband's belongings in a plastic
sandwich bag: his worn leather wallet, his watch, a jackknife, two
pocket tape measures, even a car wash token.
In a little felt-lined case, she keeps the Purple Heart he
received during World War II in the Philippines. A skinny teen-ager
when he went to war, Havrum had his service end when he took a
faceful of Japanese shrapnel. MORE
UNDATED When Callaway Golf Co. last month stood up for its
marketplace rights, it provided a valuable lesson for all
businesses threatened by regulatory ambition.
Callaway also helped the business of golf avert a disastrous
clash with the game's stewards. The last thing the game and the
industry needed was a fight between equipment manufacturers and the
game's ruling authority just as golf is poised for a new era of
growth.
