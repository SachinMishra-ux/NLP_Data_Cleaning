From time to time in my metro column, to create the desired
impact or slam home a salient point, I attributed quotes to people
who didn't exist. I could give them names, even occupations, but I
couldn't give them what they needed most a heartbeat. As anyone
who's ever touched a newspaper knows, that's one of the cardinal
sins of journalism: Thou shall not fabricate. No exceptions. No
excuses.
And yet there are always excuses. Usually they point to the
cursed fallibility of human beings, our tendency to spit in the
face of common sense, zigging when the world says zag. Sometimes
excuses reveal real or imagined inadequacies, or the belief that
the world, if it is to be conquered, must be conquered
singlehandedly.
I've already heard from dozens of people in search of an
official sound-byte, a hook upon which to hang the newly fallen
wordsmith. The (itals)reason.(unitals)
But I didn't establish priorities, and the first casualty was
time. In Boston, my face was my column. I wanted the pieces to
jolt, to be talked about, to leave the reader indelibly impressed.
And sometimes, as a result of trying to do too much at once and
cutting corners, they didn't. So I tweaked them to make sure they
did. It didn't happen often, but it did happen. And if it had only
happened once, that was one time too many.
I will survive this knowing that the heart of my columns was
honest and heartfelt. None of the pieces considered for the
American Society of Newspaper Editors award or this year's Pulitzer
Prize were doctored in any way. I will write as long as I breathe,
despite the dire predictions that this indiscretion spells the end
of my career. In the course of living this flawed life, I've
stepped into the lives of remarkable people. They will always live
in me.
So to the welders, the B-boys, the preachers, and the surgeons,
to the grocery clerks and bartenders and single mothers, to the
politicians, PR flacks, spokespersons and secretaries, to my dear
husband and family and friends, I am sorry for betraying your
trust. To the editors who supported and encouraged me, as well as
those who jumped ship when the mighty USS Smith began to take on
water, thanks for the lessons. To those colleagues and readers who
salivated daily at the thought of my head on a platter, congrats.
And to the hundreds of real people who honored me with their time
and stories, you are my salvation and I will hold you tight during
this trial.
To every single reader, young and old, black and white, who
opened their papers on Monday and Friday and trusted me to be
truth, know this: You were the truth all along.
Finally, I'd like to apologize to the memory of my father, Otis
Douglas Smith. He burns in my soul through this, and beyond this.
Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin Thursday asked for and
received the resignation of award-winning Metro columnist Patricia
Smith after the paper identified four 1998 columns in which Smith
acknowledged fabricating some characters and quotations.
Smith, who arrived at the Globe in 1990 and began writing her
Metro column in 1994, won this year's American Society of Newspaper
Editors Distinguished Writing Award for commentary and column
writing. In April, she was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist in the
commentary category. She frequently wrote passionately about racial
issues and was a lightning rod for reader approval and criticism.
