When it comes to their theology on sexuality, though, homosexual
places of worship differ sharply from the mainstream. MCC teaches
that biblical passages condemning homosexuality have been
misinterpreted. The sin of Sodom, for example, was inhospitality,
not homosexuality, the denomination holds.
The Rev. Glenna Shepherd, the MCC pastor who conducted the
Calvert-Keever commitment ceremony, said she thinks that most
churches will accept homosexuals in the future.
Shepherd, a lesbian, said mainstream churches' opposition to
same-sex marriages places gays who want to be faithful to one
partner in a no-win situation.
Calvert, however, said his allegiance to MCC will last. It is
where he says he found God and love.
In the spring of 1990, the Rev. Mike Cordle and his wife walked
past St. Mark United Methodist Church in Atlanta on their way to
see a play at the Fox Theatre.
Cordle was an up-and-comer in the North Georgia Conference of
the United Methodist Church senior pastor at St. Andrew United
Methodist Church in Cobb County, where the 1,200 members had
overpledged the annual budget and were planning a new building to
accommodate their rapid growth.
Perhaps no church in Georgia and few in the United States has seen a more dramatic turnaround because of welcoming gays and
lesbians than the old Gothic church on Peachtree Street.
Looking back, Cordle sees the hand of providence in the timing
of his first Sunday at the church. After preaching to about 90 of
its 200 mostly elderly members, he and his family stepped outside
to see a parade flowing down Peachtree Street. He joked that the
city had staged it to welcome him. It was his first Gay Pride
parade.
During the next year, Cordle worked hard and picked up eight new
members, but because of difficulty meeting denominational
obligations and utility bills, the congregation froze his salary.
And on the first anniversary of his arrival at the church, Cordle
and his family went outside to watch the Gay Pride parade again.
To settle the dispute, Cordle took the idea to the church lay
council, thinking surely the members would reject the proposal.
They didn't.
