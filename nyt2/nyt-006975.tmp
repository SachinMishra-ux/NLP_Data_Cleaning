YOUNG-COLUMN WACO, Texas I just realized I should stop
pretending I was somebody else and start being like Mike, which is
bald. I tell myself I'm not bald every day when, looking in the
mirror, I lean my head just so. Then from far-off points I comb the
morning strands in a left-to-right swipe. It is their commute to
work. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
NETHAWAY-COLUMN Klan Grand Dragon Michael Lowe talks about
white civil rights. He talks about mainstream values. He talks
about family farms to farmers. He talks about problems with
immigrants. He talks about problems with the welfare system. He
talks about the right to choose. But don't believe it. (Nethaway,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
KABAT-COLUMN A sense of ownership be it a program at church,
a product on the shelf or a marketing plan translates into the
difference between participating in something and caring deeply
about it.
It reminds me of the old joke about the ham-and-egg breakfast.
In producing it, the joke goes, the chicken is involved, but the
pig is committed. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
MINTER-COLUMN ATLANTA For the fifth June in a row, in
company of the sailing half of our family, we are headed for a
week's sail and crab-cake tour of the Chesapeake Bay. En route to
Baltimore we enjoy a traditional Delta breakfast -- two small
cookies and coffee. (Minter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
