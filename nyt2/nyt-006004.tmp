Sonic president Wally Walker has settled on Westphal to become
the team's next head coach, the Post-Intelligencer has learned. A
source within the organization and another close to the situation
said Walker would name Westphal to replace Karl before the weekend.
Both sources said the announcement could come as soon as
Wednesday afternoon. A news conference will certainly take place by
Friday.
Westphal beat out finalists Bob Hill, Charlotte assistant Paul
Silas and former Sonic assistant Bob Weiss. The Sonics waited until
after the NBA Finals so they could speak with Chicago's Phil
Jackson. Walker, though, lost interest in Jackson on Monday after
learning the Bulls coach wanted more time to decide his future.
Westphal has been Walker's choice all along, and Westphal's
meeting with All-Star point guard Gary Payton on Monday cinched the
deal.
Over lunch in Oakland, Calif., Payton's hometown, they discussed
coaching philosophy and Westphal's ideas about how to run the team.
Payton left satisfied, and that is all Walker needed to hear.
Walker recommended Westphal to team owner Barry Ackerley, who was
impressed by the new coach in a meeting several weeks ago.
Now, Walker needs only to finalize details. He and Westphal are
close to agreement on a two- or three-year deal worth between $1
million and $1.5 million each season.
When Westphal is introduced, his task instantly becomes a
daunting one. Westphal, 47, has to at least match Karl's success.
Karl was essentially fired in technical terms, they allowed his
contract to expire and did not offer a new one despite the
coach's outstanding regular-season record: .719 winning percentage
and an average of 55 victories the past six seasons. But Walker
said the decision to release Karl was because he could no longer
trust the coach on sensitive matters.
Conversely, Walker and Westphal have remained friends since both
played for the Sonics during the 1980-81 season. Walker also is
sold on Westphal's past success with the Phoenix Suns and his
reputation as a player's coach. It helps that Westphal is known to
be very discreet and conservative just like Walker.
Walker is entering the final season of his five-year deal as
president of the Sonics. It makes sense that, given the chance,
Walker would want to have a coach that is a more comfortable fit
with himself.
Sources in Phoenix said that Westphal has not coached since 1996
for one simple reason: He has been waiting for the opportunity to
coach a good team. With Payton and Vin Baker already on hand and
the ability to add a big player in the free-agent market, the
Sonics are poised to again be a contender for the Western
Conference crown.
