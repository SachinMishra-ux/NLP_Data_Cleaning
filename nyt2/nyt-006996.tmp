Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

Q. I am 26. My long-term goal is to retire very comfortably, and
my short-term goal is to purchase a home around age 30. I invest
$90 a week in my 401(k) account, and have a current balance of
$6,000 that is 60 percent invested in the George Putnam Fund of
Boston and 20 percent each in Putnam OTC and Emerging Growth and in
Fidelity Advisor Overseas. I also have $2,000 in a savings account,
and when it reaches $3,000 I plan to put it in Vanguard's Balanced
Index fund, adding $500 monthly. Am I on the right track to reach
my goals? How much will I have for my retirement years?
