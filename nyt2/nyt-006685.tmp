Although it's got some flat patches and erratic pacing, Roos'
directing debut is noteworthy not just for flirting with
outrageousness, but for embracing it.
Moreover, the movie exudes a pull-no-punches gay sensibility
even as it refuses to let characters off the hook just because
they're gay.
The weird thing is that despite the mantle of cynicism in which
he drapes his effort, Roos is below the surface quite charitable to
his characters even the hair-raising Dedee.
Here's a straightforward synopsis: Angst-riddled police
detective Nishi (Takeshi) is besieged in both his professional and
personal lives. His wife (Kayoko Kishimoto) is dying of leukemia,
his partner Horibe (Ren Osugi) is paralyzed after being shot by a
suspect. Nishi also is being badgered by loan sharks from whom he
has borrowed money to pay for his wife's hospitalization.
In the course of the film the normally unsentimental Nishi will
devote himself to his wife, inspire the embittered Horibe to take
up painting, ruthlessly track down the punk responsible for his
partner's plight, and bloodily eradicate the gangsters who keep
popping up to demand their money.
At the center is Nishi, played by Takeshi as something of a
mystery man. At times he seems as easily distracted as a bored
schoolboy; at other times you'd swear he's autistic, so incapable
is he of relating fully with another person. He hardly says a word,
preferring to grunt. He's got a bothersome facial tic that suggests
there's plenty boiling under his blank surface.
Whatever is percolating deep inside, it's nasty. With little or
no provocation Nishi explodes in horrifying violence. And yet, when
he and his ailing wife go on a long-delayed vacation undoubtedly
their last Nishi amuses her by throwing himself into silly
touristy behavior. His efforts at comedy are clumsy but
endearing. Clearly, there's love in there as well.
SLIAMMON INDIAN RESERVE, British Columbia One morning
recently, Evan Adams, a 31-year-old American Indian actor, was
telling stories in the small living room of his parents' home on
this beautiful, heavily wooded stretch of the Canadian coast.
Surrounded by his mother, three sisters and a brother, he
explained in his singsong voice how he had terrified some of the
participants in a first-aid course he had taken by reacting with
passionate alarm toward a doll that was supposedly choking and its
inflatable mother.
This gentle gibe brought gales of laughter from Adams' family,
and it was just one episode in a day of wordplay among a group of
people clearly comfortable communicating through sometimes bawdy
humor and irony. That, of course, would be unremarkable in such a
close-knit family except for the fact that Indians have generally
been depicted in popular culture, and especially in movies, as
earnest and stoic, sometimes pathetic and at times bloodthirsty,
but rarely wry.
