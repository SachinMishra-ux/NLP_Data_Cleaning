Oh, sure, the sight of a sullen, 21-year-old convenience store
clerk fingering his eyebrow rings is almost enough to make my
rethink my opposition to mandatory sterilization. And the way some
men my age and older pull what few remaining hairs they have left
back into those pathetic little ponytails makes me think that we
might save everyone a lot of time and trouble if we forget about
Social Security reform and, instead, just have us leap off a high
cliff once we turn 40 or buy our first toupee, whichever comes
first.
Flagpole sitting and goldfish swallowing were fads that had the
common courtesy to die out quickly. Bumper stickers show no sign of
going away soon, and we can blame it all on a few well-intentioned
parents in 1985 who thought they were promoting highway safety.
(You can bet we won't make that mistake again!)
Truckers and ordinary drivers yakked back and forth to each
other to find out which gas stations were open and selling gas.
(Ah, the good old days.) It wouldn't have been so bad if that was
all there was to it, but, of course, it wasn't.
Sure, it's some of the dumbest, shoddiest, most useless junk
ever to defile our planet but, heck, it might be worth something
someday. Especially if any of those things ever become popular
again. Think about that.
NEW YORK Outside the Metropolitan Club on East 60th Street the
other day, a line of tan and entitled-looking guests waited to be
admitted to a showing of John Galliano's first fur collection.
As a group, impeccably dressed and speaking Italian, French and
Fashionese, they looked like sitting ducks for animal-rights
advocates. Yet, no disturbances ensued, in part because the staff
of Christian Dior (Galliano is Dior's designer) had not delivered
invitations announcing the location until the last minute.
Given the buzz (both Madonna and the artist formerly known as
Prince had requested tickets, though neither appeared), the scene
at the door was relatively serene. In addition to buyers, editors,
investors and the social types one associates with Dior and with
fur (including Jocelyne Wildenstein), many young fashion followers
were at hand, egged on, perhaps, by the media's current fur frenzy.
After 300 guests passed by security guards who pawed through
their bags, they stood around in the club's monumental marble
entrance hall (completed by Stanford White in 1894) waiting to go
upstairs. Since it was the first time Galliano was bringing his
flamboyant style of fashion show and his Mediterranean sense of
time to New York, the crowd didn't seem to mind waiting for an
hour.
To amuse and sedate them, there was wine, heaping piles of
fruit, trays of canapes, and a harpsichordist under the vaulted
ceiling. There was also Anna Wintour, fur's big champion, looking
down at the crowd in her sunglasses, like some kind of master
puppeteer, from atop a grand marble staircase. And if that wasn't
enough, several nearly naked, androgynous male models were
lounging, Casanova-style, on banisters and benches. One was
lounging on the floor.
While the guests waited downstairs, two immense banquet rooms
upstairs, once used by Vanderbilts, Whitneys and Roosevelts, were
being readied for seating. They had been artfully trashed to create
a Casanova-has-been-here look with period furniture strewn with
flower petals, talcum powder, costume jewelry, and dirty wine
glasses. There was a canopied bed festooned with wreaths of flowers
and one long banquet table that looked as if it had just been
vacated by Madame de Pompadour, Rousseau, Louis XV and other
members of Casanova's coterie. One male model was lying on top of
the table, biding his time by eating grapes.
