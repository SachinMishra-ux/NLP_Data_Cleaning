The United States, citing a $50 billion-a-year trade deficit
with China, will also push leaders to ease import restrictions.
On this trip, complaints have already arisen at home about
Clinton's visit to Tiananmen Square for the official welcoming
ceremony on Saturday. Clinton will be greeted by Chinese leaders in
the Great Hall of the People.
White House officials have intentionally scheduled the ceremony
for late Friday night EST, and have scheduled a press statement for
immediately afterward by Clinton at the Great Hall, where he will
issue a proclamation on human rights.
White House press secretary Michael McCurry said Clinton is
buoyed by the controversy because he believes it will help attract
attention to his mission of engagement.
A rematch with Tampa Bay at the Cotton Bowl tonight offers the
Burn a chance to prove it can win when expected. The game will also
give the Burn an opportunity to avenge an earlier loss to the
Mutiny, and a victory would allow Dallas to start closing the gap
in the MLS' Western Conference.
Two goals by U.S. national teamer Frankie Hejduk helped the
Mutiny (3-12) defeat Dallas, 3-1, on April 11. John Kowalski has
since resigned as Tampa Bay's coach, and Hejduk is starting for
Team USA against Iran in today's World Cup match.
Dallas (8-6) has its own problems and could have up to six
players miss today's match. Alain Sutter, Eric Dade, Jorge Flores,
Richard Farrer and Gerell Elliot could be sidelined by injuries,
and Leonel Alvarez will not play because of an accumulation of
yellow cards.
The Burn's last home game marked the league's most lopsided
match ever, an 8-1 loss to Los Angeles. Disappointing road games at
D.C. United and Chicago followed.
In two-plus seasons, the Burn has strung together no better than
a five-game winning streak, once last season and in 1996. This
year, Dallas started 3-0 but has yet to match that streak.
The Burn has been unable to project any fear factor like that
associated with Los Angeles or D.C. United, Washington said. In
1996, LA started 12-0 and began 9-0 this season. Two-time MLS
champion D.C. has consecutive 13-4 starts.
