This movie, which was directed by Chris Eyre, 28, is the work
not just of a group of creative people with full hearts but of
aggressive achievers determined to stake their claim to high ground
on the American cultural map.
He said in an interview that one of his primary goals was to
take away from so-called white experts the responsibility for
describing contemporary Indian culture. His aim, he said, is not to
avoid criticism of Indian society but to make sure that it is
Indians doing the criticizing and interpreting.
But beyond all that, Adams whose grandparents and several
aunts died of tuberculosis will begin medical school at the
University of Calgary this fall, to fulfill a goal of bringing
something back to his reservation, a hamlet of 650 people about 100
miles north of Vancouver amid mountains, towering cedars and rich
blue waters.
But the story is consistently enlivened by a self-deprecating
sense of humor, one of the most enduring Indian cultural
characteristics, particularly on the reservations, according to the
makers of the film.
But the film has a far different sensibility. The characters are
angry, but they're also silly, loving, careless, vulnerable, witty
and persistent. They play basketball. They laugh at their squalor.
At one point the only way they can go forward is by driving a
car backward. They mock Indian stereotypes, and they embrace them.
In fact, they are much like the group of people who made the film.
Eyre, a graduate of the film school at New York University, is a
Cheyenne-Arapaho who was adopted as a baby and brought up by a
white family in Oregon. He has spent the last few years tracking
down his biological parents and embracing his Indian heritage.
Beach, 25, an Ojibway from north of Winnipeg, bluntly described
how much of his own personal history was reflected in that of his
character, Victor, who is haunted by the absence of a parent. He
said the defining element of his early life was the death of his
mother, who was killed by a drunken driver when he was 8; she was
eight months pregnant at the time. His father drowned two months
later.
And then there is Adams, who has been almost frenetic in his
efforts both to investigate his culture through writing and acting
and to serve his people as a doctor. His parallel career paths
reflect a tension that runs through the lives of many Indians, he
said: whether to concentrate on articulating a distinct cultural
vision to the world outside the reservations or to focus on their
own people.
Adams is still undecided on which path will win out in his case,
but he seems to be leaning in one direction.
