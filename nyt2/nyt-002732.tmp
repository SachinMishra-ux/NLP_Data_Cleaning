Garfield's remains were hauled off to Lake View Cemetery at
12316 Euclid Ave. in Cleveland, Ohio, 44106-4393. I heave in the
full address here because you need it to enter this 50-word essay
contest, and quickly, too. The deadline is Thursday (6-11) and you
need an entry form. (Call 216-421-2665.) 
I have been to Cleveland dozens of times but never to the 285
acres that make up Lake View Cemetery, where, by the way, John D.
Rockefeller also is buried, to say nothing (and I intend to say
nothing) of Eliot Ness' ashes. 
So if I myself enter this contest, I will use as one of my
reasons for wanting to win my deep (about six feet) desire to come
to a place I've never visited. (Never having been there before is
also the only reason I can think of for my hope one day to visit
Idaho.) 
If you enter this contest, you will need to provide a reason for
wanting to win, besides simply being hungry and willing to satisfy
that hunger while hanging out at the Garfield Monument in
Cleveland. 
You might, for instance, feign interest in Garfield's youth,
during which his father (apparently not of very tough stock) died
when James was barely 2 years old. Or perhaps you could say you've
always been intrigued by anyone whose early schooling was done at a
place named the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in Hiram, Ohio. 
I certainly have never known anyone who attended anything called
an Eclectic Institute. The closest was my childhood friend Bob
Lippold who, as I recall, once went to an electric institute,
though probably that's not all that close. 
Another approach would be to focus on how a man who gained so
much so quickly also lost it with equally blazing speed. 
For, you see, Garfield, who probably would have been a good
president, served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 18
years, becoming chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, one
of a handful of such committees always preceded by the word
powerful. But in 1880 the Ohio legislature elected him to the U.S.
Senate, which was how, back then, senators were picked. 
That very same year, the Republican national convention in
Chicago got divided between James G. Blaine and U.S. Grant, so it
chose Garfield on the 36th ballot. In November he beat Winfield
Hancock, the Democrat, by a hair. 
Less than a year later Garfield was decomposing in Cleveland. If
you can't compose a compelling essay with these facts, maybe you,
too, should be shot.
