Couples is counting on future playing trips to his old haunts as
well, with the new TPC Course at Snoqualmie Ridge expected to
attract a PGA Tour stop as early as next year.
Couples, his hair graying around the edges, said he has found an
inner peace which comes from moving on from personal tragedy and
playing well again. His father, Tom, died from cancer last year.
Couples enters the Open coming off a win at The Memorial two
weeks ago, his second of the season. He has runner-up finishes at
the Masters and Byron Nelson, two events that easily could have
been victories.
He sees a score close to par winning at The Olympic Club. He
sees a guy hanging tough in the tortuous conditions pulling out a
hard-earned victory. He sees himself.
TOKYO As the yen continues to fall, experts worldwide say it
is due to severe loss of confidence in the Japanese economy. In
Japan, the experts say it is Nippon uri, or the selling out of
Japan.
With the official discount rate stuck at 0.5 percent, and many
depositors in Japan getting less than 1 percent interest for their
money, it was inevitable that they would eventually begin to look
abroad. When they did, it was inevitable that the yen would begin
to weaken.
Anyone who keeps his money in yen is losing not just the
interest spread but also the exchange gains, a total of well over
10 percent per annum for the past five years.
What is surprising is not the yen collapse we see today but the
absence of collapse years ago when it was already clear that the
economy would not recover quickly.
Timidity, misguided patriotism and optimism for early recovery
were the main reasons why most Japanese kept their money in Japan.
It has taken the best part of five years, and some easing of the
rules on sending money abroad, for depositors to get smart.
Rather than loss of confidence or the selling out of Japan, what
we see now is a belated understanding of how foreign exchange
markets work.
