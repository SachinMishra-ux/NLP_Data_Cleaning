Well, get ready. I mean, get ready. Because it looks like it's
a-coming unless someone knocks some sense into the folks at NBC and
TNT/TBS right quick.
If you haven't been following this ongoing non-story, General
Electric's NBC and Time Warner's cable networks are considering
launching a new pro football league by as early as 1999 that would
compete against the NFL and its network partners, ABC, ESPN, Fox
and CBS.
Left at the altar by NFL owners when future TV broadcast rights
were auctioned off, NBC and TNT are looking for programming to fill
what now looms as a gaping hole in their entertainment schedules.
We can sympathize with their loss. In the fragmented TV world of
today, where viewers can and do pick from dozens of channels,
networks have a harder and harder time attracting large,
demographically attractive viewing audiences for advertisers.
Pro football is still the best way to capture the attention of
one of those key audiences, young adult males. Losing the NFL,
which NBC and Turner did when they chose not to ante up the
billions necessary to stay in the game, cost the networks
significant advertising revenue and prestige for years to come.
Some critics of the new league proposal like to think of the
plan as a revenge scheme. Who knows? Maybe vengeance is a part of
it. Getting back at the folks who run the NFL would be great sport
for the jilted networks. But the guess here is that, in the
sobering light of day, the networks are far more businesslike than
that implies.
Not even the networks seem completely certain of that yet. On
the plus side, there may be some advertisers out there who'd look
at a new league as a viable alternative, given the soaring ad rates
being charged by the NFL. Also, there may be some economic benefits
to the networks owning their own league eliminating the middle
man, as it were.
For now, executives at NBC and Turner will only say they're
moving close to a commitment which they are likely to announce in a
few months.
Certainly, a new league is not in the interest of football fans.
Salaries in the NFL, thanks to the new TV deal, are on their way to
rocketing to an average of more than $1 million per player. Yet,
quality is hardly up, thanks to constant expansion.
Depth at the skill positions in the league is particularly
suspect. Spreading the limited number of capable quarterbacks, for
one, across a dozen teams in a new league will only water down a
product like a ballpark beer.
