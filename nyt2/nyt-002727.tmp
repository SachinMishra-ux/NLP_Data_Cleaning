But even these narrowly drawn cases could enmesh the courts in
disputes over basic business strategies: how to market products,
how to write customer contracts, how to price products and how to
design them, and what obligations dominant companies have toward
their customers.
Others say Microsoft's tactics are a simple case of a monopolist
forcing consumers to buy its other products. Xerox tried it with
copier paper; IBM tried it with punch cards; even a manufacturer of
a salt dispenser to make snow melt tried to get everyone to buy its
salt too.
The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a half-billionaire
businessman who spent $40 million of his own money in the race for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, brought forth a certain
populist euphoria a new conventional wisdom across the land that
even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters' love.
But tempting as it might be in light of current campaign-finance
scandals to conclude that voters rejected the corrosive power of
money in politics, the reality is considerably more complex, and
less uplifting.
For one thing, the winning candidate, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, a
23-year veteran of state politics, is himself a relentless
fund-raiser, one often accused of blending his campaign-finance
outings with his official duties. And even if he seemed a pauper
compared to Checchi, his campaign spending still broke the old $9
million record for a gubernatorial primary campaign here, set in
1994.
Furthermore, a contrary example of the power of money loomed
just as large here last week: A $20-million campaign by organized
labor managed to defeat a ballot measure that would have required
unions to obtain annual written consent of their members before
using dues for political purposes. The measure was favored in early
public opinion polls, but its opponents outspent supporters 3 to 1,
and union members went to the polls in unusually large numbers,
helping Davis in the process.
There isn't much evidence that the rules of wealth and politics
have dramatically changed. Since at least the days of Andrew
Jackson, Americans have been ambivalent toward the wealthy in
politics, celebrating the triumph of log cabin little guys and
viewing elites with suspicion.
Some of those candidates spent money in ways that would almost
certainly be subject to intense media scrutiny now; for example, by
trading favors or greasing the palms of local political bosses. But
since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling that the First Amendment right
to free speech bars limits on a candidate's spending of his or her
own money, millionaires have had an unchallenged license to test
the political waters.
Indeed, politicians here and around the country said, Checchi's
money had less to do with his defeat than how he chose to spend it.
Even after 18 months crisscrossing the state talking to voters and
3 months of television commercials touting his private sector
accomplishments and teaching voters how to pronounce his name
(CHECK-ee), he drew about as many unfavorable ratings from poll
respondents as favorable ones not good news for any candidate.
Then, when Rep. Jane Harman, herself a millionaire, entered the
race and promptly took the lead in public opinion polls, Checchi
unleashed a relentless barrage of commercials attacking her, often
in misleading terms. That helped destroy Ms. Harman, who spent some
$16 million of family money on her campaign. But, in a kind of
murder-suicide, it also quadrupled Checchi's own negative ratings
and created an opening for Davis, who had been saving his
advertising money for the final stretch.
