Despite the defection of nine moderates in the party unwilling
to support spending reductions of the magnitude called for in the
budget outline, the Republican leadership rammed the measure
through by a 216-204 vote after a contentious debate and some
intense arm-twisting.
The House plan calls for about $100 billion in tax cuts over the
next five years, offset by spending cuts of the same amount. The
primary tax cut would be a reduction in the so-called marriage
penalty, the provision in the tax code that forces many two-income
couples to pay more than they would if single.
It must be reconciled with a version passed by the Senate that
calls for $30 billion in tax cuts and keeps spending largely on the
path agreed to by Congress and President Clinton in last year's
balanced budget deal. And even after the House and Senate resolve
their differences, the resulting budget plan does not become law
but rather serves as a general blueprint for drafting spending and
tax bills.
The House decided Friday to increase military spending slightly
before accounting for the effects of inflation, but to reduce
domestic spending substantially. The plan did not specify what
programs would be cut from the budget, which next year will total
about $1.7 trillion, and postponed most of the reductions until
later years.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who worked the House floor until
the final moments to insure that wavering moderates voted yes, said
it was clear that the House would have to move in the Senate's
direction, somewhat diluting the party's ideological message. House
members are also under pressure from many governors to soften
provisions that would cut promised welfare block grants to the
states.
But a split-the-difference compromise with the Senate, yielding
tax and spending cuts of $60 billion or so over the next five
years, would put the Republicans into a potentially bruising fight
with the White House and congressional Democrats heading into the
fall election campaign.
Indeed, despite the prospect of huge budget surpluses for years
to come, the two parties are having much the same argument they
were having two years ago when they both anticipated deficits well
into the future.
In his budget proposal early this year, Clinton called for more
than $100 billion of new spending programs in education, child care
and health care, paid for in part by revenues the White House hopes
will be generated by anti-smoking legislation that may or may not
pass Congress. Clinton's budget called for $20 billion of narrowly
targeted tax cuts.
Moreover, Democratic strategists said, Friday's vote could give
Democrats potent ammunition in their effort to win back control of
the House by putting some moderate Republicans in key districts on
record as favoring what their Democratic opponents in the fall will
portray as extreme cuts.
Still, conservative Republicans seemed to be spoiling for
another ideological fight. After having seen their fervor for
smaller government dissipate last year under pressure to reach a
pragmatic budget-balancing compromise with Clinton, Gingrich and
his lieutenants were clearly eager to reassert their conservative
credentials in advance of this year's mid-term Congressional
elections.
