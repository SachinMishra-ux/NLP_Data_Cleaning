So when race leaders crashed and fumbled away a victory to
Woodside a few weeks back in Kansas, the 27-year-old Valencia
driver knew someday he'd have to give up a win in the same fashion.
That day arrived this past Sunday at Altamont Raceway Park in
Tracy. Woodside led 198 laps of the 200-lap Spears Manufacturing
200 before being taken out in a crash on the turn before the
checkered flag.
Woodside started the race on the pole and led all the way until
getting a late challenge from eventual winner Kevin Harvick and
Gary Smith.
Smith bumped Woodside while taking the lead coming out of turn
two. Woodside caught him on the outside coming out of turn 3. But
as the cars went into turn 4, Smith squeezed Woodside up high,
bumping him head-on into the wall.
While Woodside, Smith and Raudman were skidding around the
track, Harvick took the checkered flag and retook the series points
lead from Woodside. Harvick has a five-point advantage, 1,124-1,119
over Woodside. Smith is a distant third at 1,036.
Woodside's car took a beating in the crash and is being rebuilt
in the North Carolina shop of NASCAR mechanical-whiz Ronnie
Hopkins.
If the crash was unfortunate, at least it came at a point in the
schedule where Woodside's team will have time to get his car back
in shape.
Despite his injured ribs, Woodside doesn't want to wait until
July for his next race. He plans to drive in the June 27 NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Tour race at Sears Point.
Lengthy lead: Despite a wire-to-wire victory by Prunedale driver
Doug McCoun, Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke padded his Featherlite
Southwest Tour season points lead with a fourth-place finish in
Sunday's Altamont 100.
Back in the saddle: Defending Trans-Am champion Tom Kendall,
without a steady ride for most of this season, will be busy this
summer.
