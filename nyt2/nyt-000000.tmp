NEW YORK Kenneth Joseph Lenihan, a New York research
sociologist who helped refine the scientific methods used in
criminology, died May 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
Lenihan retired in 1995 as an associate professor of sociology
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He had joined the faculty
in 1980, after earlier stints as a researcher at Columbia
University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, the Vera Institute
of Justice in New York and the Bureau of Social Science Research in
Washington.
He brought his expertise to the study of recidivism rates among
criminal offenders. He conducted a study in Baltimore, called the
Life Project, for the U.S. Department of Labor in the early 1970s.
Lenihan was born in Queens, and graduated from Columbia's School
of General Studies in 1960. He also earned his M.A. and Ph.D. in
sociology at Columbia, the latter in 1974.
Lenihan is survived by two sons, Andrew of Miami, and William of
Manhattan; a daughter, Jean Lenihan of Seattle; four sisters,
Eileen McEwan of Houston, Moira Earhart of North Carolina, Jean
Dobson of Bay Shore, N.Y., and Sue Adams of Cape May, N.J.; and
three grandchildren.
NEW YORK When Jack Lin heard his winning bid for a newly
minted taxi medallion announced at City Hall last September, he
felt a flush of love for his adopted country.
But Lin's heavily financed $231,791 investment has been looking
a little risky since Thursday, when the commission steeply
increased insurance requirements and dropped the thresholds at
which cabbies can lose their licenses. With a requirement to set
aside another $100,000 for accident victims and even lower
suspension thresholds likely to be voted on this month, it could
get riskier still.
Of the tens of thousands of taxi and livery drivers and owners
having to deal with the commission's new safety regulations, the
5,000 owner-drivers of yellow cabs, who have neither bosses nor
workers to cushion the impact of the changes, have been hit the
hardest.
And no one is more bitter than the men and women who bought 400
new medallions at auctions in 1996 and 1997 except, perhaps, for
more recent buyers who paid even more money, up to $250,000 each
for pre-existing medallions, only to learn that prices have plunged
as much as $50,000 since the new rules were announced.
The commission says that cabbies who own their medallions are
the safest drivers because they have the most invested, both
financially and emotionally, in their business. But when they do
get into accidents, they tend to leave their victims even more
poorly compensated than the rest of the industry.
