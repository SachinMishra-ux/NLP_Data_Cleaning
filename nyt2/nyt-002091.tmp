Donohue's acceptance remarks clearly had the flavor of a
runningmate, not a boss. She concentrated on the traditionally
female roles she has held: mother and teacher. And she made little
more than passing reference to her more recent careers as a
down-and-dirty criminal prosecutor and a tough-sentencing judge.
She went on to hail Pataki's efforts to cut crime in New York a claim that might ring hollow to her neighbors in Rensselaer
County, where violent crime has increased 33 percent since 1992
even as it has fallen statewide.
Pataki, who was asked to compare his current lieutenant governor
to Donohue, said her support of his agenda is an obvious plus.
Reissued recently as part of a series on business pioneers,
Reich's subject is the financial strategist who in the 1950s, '60s,
and '70s built Lazard Freres into a powerhouse among investment
banks. Fifteen years after it first appeared, it's still is an
exceptionally good read if you're interested in why Avis
Rent-a-Car turned out so well, for example, or in the Agnelli or
Englehard families. (The affable author, one of the best business
journalists in New York, died suddenly of pancreatic cancer in
March at 48.)
The legendary Meyer had a typical French marriage of a certain
sort: a discreet, devoted wife and an eye that wandered widely over
the years, from chanteuse Claude Alphande to Jacqueline Onassis.
Bella Meyer faded into the background; she survived her husband
(who died in 1979) by only six months.
Now the story has made a swell book. It is not as much about
game theory that Nash helped pioneer as about the ways that
mathematicians lead their lives, and about schizophrenia. The
person who holds it all together is a pretty young physicist named
Alicia Larde, who married Nash.
John Forbes Nash Jr. was born in 1928 in Bluefield, W. Va., a
rugged Appalachian coal town where his father was an electric
utility engineer. His Protestant parents were routinely demanding;
in 1945, his talent for mathematics already obvious, Nash went off
to the Carnegie Institute of Technology; by the middle of his
junior year he had been accepted for graduate study at Harvard,
Princeton, Chicago, and Michigan. He chose Princeton, then, as now,
the mathematical center of the universe.
Already there were signs of the otherworldliness that was to
plague him. As a teenager he danced with chairs, played unfunny
practical jokes, and made clear his attraction to other boys. As a
young adult, he careened back and forth between men and women. But
he also possessed unmistakable talent, and at Princeton it
blossomed for a time into genius.
It was in his thesis that Nash described the concept that bears
his name: Nash equilibrium, or the situation in which each player
has adopted the strategy that serves him best in consideration of
the strategies of all others. That carefully delineated bit of
mathematics, and a further contribution to the theory of games,
were sufficient to win him a series of distinguished appointments:
to think tank Rand Corp., the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. He fathered a
son by his mistress, then married vivacious Alicia Larde, whom he
met in his course on advanced calculus for engineers.
Nash's antics increased in intensity and frequency. One winter
day in 1959, he walked into the common room at MIT and announced to
no one in particular that that day's New York Times contained a
message from a superior race in another galaxy that only he could
understand. Nasar's book chronicles the long bigger saga of the
paranoid schizophrenia that plagued Nash for the next 30 years,
that severed his links with virtually every one of the communities
that had sustained him: the schools, fellowships, departments,
friendships, children, and, in 1963, his marriage.
