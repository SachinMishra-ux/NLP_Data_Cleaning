What's behind the changing numbers is a growing sophistication
in preventive health strategies. And in many cases, what once was
viewed as medical gospel is being cast aside or challenged by new
medical knowledge. For example:
Dietitians are re-evaluating the role of fat in the diet. After
a decade of recommending low-fat diets, most dietitians now believe
fat is critical in maintaining blood sugars. Instead, attention has
been turned toward whether people consume too many carbohydrates
and get too little exercise.
Most doctors still believe that a normal cholesterol level
should be below 200, but a growing number of heart doctors and
alternative medicine specialists believe the number should be below
150.
Some exercise experts believe that what matters is not what you
weigh on the scale, but how fit you are. And they are challenging
the movement to get people to lose weight. It is inactivity, not
pounds, that leads to sickness and early death.
One reason for the increasing focus on health-related number
guidelines is that more Americans are taking charge of their health
and looking for ways to improve their diets and live healthier,
more active lifestyles.
Richard and Astrid Jackson of Druid Hills, both in their 60s,
think they can have an impact on their health.
That belief is also driving changes in the medical marketplace.
Managed care, the health trend du jour, is built on the philosophy
that the best way to save health care dollars is to keep people
healthy through disease prevention. Offering everything from cancer
screenings at malls to well-baby checkups to reminder cards for eye
exams to diabetics, managed care at its best has pushed preventive
care to the forefront.
But as the field and health guidelines change, how reliable
are the numbers, graphs and charts we study? And which guidelines
are the most important to follow?
Researchers and physicians from all walks of life and
philosophies tout the value of regular exercise at least 20
minutes a day for improved cardiac function and flexibility.
And the body mass index a ratio of height and weight is only
useful as a general tool for the average population; it does not
indicate any kind of health status for those who either are thin,
but are inactive or for serious athletes. Better indicators are the
waist-to-thigh ratio or body fat content measurements, which gauge
a person's fat and fitness levels.
