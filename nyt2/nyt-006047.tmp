Since then, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, have spoken out against the program and both
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have voiced support for
the program.
During sentencing Wednesday for Francis John Kufrovich of
suburban Woodland Hills, prosecutors also said three other
youngsters, some from the Los Angeles area, are prepared to testify
about sexual relations with the 43-year-old. Prosecutors declined
to say whether Kufrovich faces charges based on those allegations.
In addition to 18 months in prison, Kufrovich also was ordered
to undergo three years of supervised release, mental counseling and
biannual lie-detector tests about his contact with minors,
officials said.
Before the sentencing in U.S. District Court in New Haven,
Conn., Kufrovich apologized tearfully to the Connecticut teen,
saying counseling has helped him to recognize his problem.
The girl, now 16, told Senior U.S. District Judge Ellen Bree
Burns that the incident put her into a deep depression and gave her
anxiety attacks that require medication.
Kufrovich was ordered to pay $25,000 in restitution to the
victim and her family for psychiatric care and counseling,
Garrity-Rokous said.
This was one of the first cases in the country brought under the
1996 Communications Decency Act, which makes it illegal to use the
Internet to persuade or induce a minor into sex.
Prosecutors said Kufrovich met the teen-ager in an online chat
room before arranging to meet her in Irving, Texas, where she and
her mother were attending a swim meet in March 1996, Garrity-Rokous
said. Kufrovich checked into the same hotel and invited the girl to
his room, where he tried to molest her, court records said.
Kufrovich pleaded guilty in March to one felony count each of
communicating interstate to entice a minor to engage in sex and
traveling interstate with the same intent.
Because Kufrovich had no criminal record, federal sentencing
guidelines called for a sentence of 12 to 21 months, which is
considerably less than the maximum 10-year prison term, the
prosecutor said.
