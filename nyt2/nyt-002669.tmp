But Sloan's pleas were in vain. The Jazz Sunday night continued
to play like a team born from the Western Conference stereotype:
all talent, no backbone.
The feistiness belonged to the Bulls. Pippen did not get credit
for every steal, or every forced turnover, but the fact that he was
able to roam the court helped him disrupt everything in his path.
He was there to shut down Stockton and make him look like a shell
of himself with repeated turnovers.
Kukoc was there to pick up the remnants of Pippen's work by
grabbing three first-half steals from the flustered and frustrated
Jazz. By the end of the first half, the Jazz had turned the ball
over 12 times, including 9 in the second quarter.
Pippen got credit for one steal and one blocked shot. Kukoc came
up with five rebounds to go with his steals.
As aggressive as the duo was on defense, it was equally
assertive on offense. Pippen and Kukoc were going to make the Jazz
work.
They were making a living getting under the skin of the Jazz.
This kind of effort was expected of Pippen. He is so diverse, his
normal play affects about three or four categories by the end of
the night.
Kukoc's consistency has been questioned. In Game 2, he came out
with a sense of urgency to get himself into the game. He scored 13
first-half points, and helped take some of the burden off of
Michael Jordan. In the second half, though, he did not score
because he did not get aggressive.
The Bulls barged inside like party-crashers Sunday night. And
falling into the stereotypical mold of a team out of the West, the
Jazz simply stepped aside all too politely.
SEATTLE The Los Angeles Dodgers were three outs from going
home with a smile, but since when is anything that easy?
After eight solid innings from Darren Dreifort on Sunday,
manager Bill Russell needed three relievers to get through the
ninth inning of a 7-4 interleague victory over the Seattle Mariners
in front of 41,514 at the Kingdome.
