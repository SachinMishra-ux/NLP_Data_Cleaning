NEW YORK Opening a new front in the battle over the future of
Yankee Stadium, George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner,
all but threatened Thursday night to leave New York City unless
Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, abandoned his push for a
referendum on whether city money should be used to help build a new
ball park.
Steinbrenner's comments came only hours after City Council
leaders, in a rare act of defiance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
unveiled their own plan for the city's next budget. For the last
several days, the mayor and the City Council have been deadlocked
over the budget because of Giuliani's refusal to consider any
changes proposed by the council unless Vallone abandoned his call
for a public vote on the stadium issue.
In his statement, Steinbrenner accused Vallone of using the
referendum to bolster his campaign for governor, and added:
The Yankees owner's words were the strongest he has used so far
on the subject of the team's future home, and they came a month
after Steinbrenner stated that he would refrain from discussing the
team's future until the end of the season because, he said, the
issue had become too emotional and politicized.
Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said she was unaware
of Steinbrenner's five-paragraph statement, which echoed many of
the criticisms of Vallone that Giuliani and his aides had voiced
hours earlier. But aides to the council speaker accused the mayor
of pressing Steinbrenner to issue the statement.
Vallone has argued that the voters should have a say in whether
to use hundreds of millions of dollars in public money for sports
stadiums. Giuliani has contended that such a vote would galvanize
opposition to the idea of building a new stadium on the West Side
of Manhattan and push the Yankees owner to look for a new stadium
site in New Jersey.
The war of words came at the close of a day in which Vallone and
the mayor wrangled aggressively over the budget and its tangled
connection with the stadium issue.
With the negotiations stalled over the budget, the council
offered its own proposal that is expected to be approved Friday.
That plan, at $34.08 billion, was actually $49 million less than
the budget proposed by the mayor a few weeks ago, and contained a
few hundred million dollars in changes that, especially in a year
of a $2 billion record surplus, could be expected to be ironed out
easily through the usual give-and-take of budget talks.
Nevertheless, the two sides spent the day warring and accusing
each other of fiscal recklessness and political duplicity.
