One liberal Catholic who did attend was the Rev. Eduard Fischer,
the priest who was dismissed from his parish duties by Krenn for

including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
These days Bob Bennett is working on fending off Ms. Jones'
appeal of her case and fighting efforts by the independent counsel
to get top Clinton aides to testify about the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
In his own downtown office, Bill Bennett is initially more
cautious than his brother, and still shows signs of the shy child

students in their states.
The move toward greater use of merit scholarships, particularly
at a time of record stock portfolios, has some scholars asserting
that colleges are backing away from traditional responsibilities.
