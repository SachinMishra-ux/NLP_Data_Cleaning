Opponents mounted an effort last fall to rescind the original
vote but were rebuffed by a large margin in a second statewide
referendum. It has been a widely held belief in Oregon that the
margin was not so much an indication that people approved of
physician-assisted suicide but rather a reflection of voters'
resentment that the opponents did not accept the will of the
electorate the first time.
Constantine was pressed to declare the law inoperative by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. Hatch on Friday criticized Reno's decision in a
statement, saying she had misunderstood the federal drug laws.
The issue has prompted politicians like Hatch and Hyde, who have
long decried federal intervention and promoted states rights, to
argue for Washington to intervene. The Supreme Court has said that
while there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, states
are free to create their own laws on the issue.
Supporters of the law Friday predicted that Reno's ruling will
not greatly increase the number of people in Oregon who will commit
suicide with a doctor's help. State officials have said they will
release a report as soon as they have recorded 10 suicides and they
have not yet done so. Barbara Combs Lee, who wrote the proposal in
the referendum, said that news reports attributing information to
family and friends account for only three suicides so far.
The state's Death with Dignity Act gives terminally-ill adults
the right to request a lethal dose of prescription drugs if the
patient is of sound mind and judged by two doctors to have less
than six months to live.
Interpretation: Perhaps the strongest passages in the Bible
referring to homosexuality. However, advocates of a more lenient
view of homosexuality in the church say the condemnation of
male-male sexual relations must be taken in the context of
Leviticus' emphasis on keeping certain practices to preserve Jewish
identity. Other laws in Leviticus forbid eating shellfish and
wearing mixed fabric.
Another group of Christians views religious-based efforts to
make gay people straight as not only impossible, but cruel. They
insist there is no such thing as an ex-gay person.
Vaiden has lived on both sides of the issue. He tried celibacy.
He tried marriage. He tried God. But his homosexual desires
persisted. He eventually divorced his wife and for the past 15
years has been living with a man in Stone Mountain. His partner,
Lowrey Fleming, whom he met in a Bible study class, helped Vaiden
raise his two sons, now adults in their early 20s.
Vaiden says he is comfortable with his sexual orientation today.
But many Christians remain certain that practicing homosexuality is
a sin. The issue has split the Christian community into two camps.
Founded in 1976, Exodus has 88 chapters in the United States and
nine international chapters in places as far apart as Singapore and
the United Kingdom.
