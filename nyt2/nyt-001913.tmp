Another conference speaker, Dr. Carl Feit, worked as a research
scientist at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research
before accepting an appointment as a professor of health sciences
at Yeshiva University in New York, where Feit is free to mingle his
scientific research and Jewish faith.
Feit cited a growing body of research showing that religious
faith may strengthen the immune system and help the body fight
disease.
Richardson did not invite Phillip Johnson, a law professor at UC
Berkeley and an outspoken critic of evolutionary theory. In an
interview, Johnson said the fuzzy mix of science and spirituality
at conferences like the upcoming Berkeley gathering produce neither
good science nor good theology.
Johnson will have many more opportunities for debating these
folks. Last week, the John Templeton Foundation, which funded the
conference, announced that it was giving another $12.6 million to
the Center for the Theology and the Natural Sciences to develop
programs in science and religion at universities worldwide.

There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.
