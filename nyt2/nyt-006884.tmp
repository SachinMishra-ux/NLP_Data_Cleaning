This, folks, is what a top-notch pitching staff looks like. Pay
attention to it, because stretches like this don't tend to last
very long outside of Atlanta.
Forget for a moment that the Diamondbacks gained only one game
in the standings entering Thursday's game. That's not the important
part of this three-game win streak.
This is about a brand-new franchise finding some players it can
count on, which is really what the 1998 season is all about. Benes
is a known quantity. He will produce his 15 or so victories over
the course of a full season.
Blair won a career-best 16 last year and has suffered some hard
luck in the form of very few runs along the way to his 2-9 record.
Anderson, who pitched seven scoreless innings in Thursday
afternoon's victory, has won four straight decisions to improve to
5-6.
Daal, probably the biggest surprise of the bunch, is pitching as
if he wants no part of the bullpen ever again. Since replacing
injured Joel Adamson in the rotation, Daal has baffled opponents
and has allowed only two earned runs in his past 17 innings.
The Diamondbacks, who one month ago were on a pace to go 44-118,
are suddenly on a pace to win 56 games. They have played above .500
in their past 33 games and no longer can be considered the
pushovers they were in April.
To his credit, Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor has stuck
with his core of starters. Benes, Blair and Anderson have started
at least 15 games, never missing a turn.
Daal has not missed a turn since he was inserted into the
rotation, and even Jeff Suppan must admit he was given more than a
fair shake, lasting 11 starts before being sent to Triple-A Tucson
with his 1-6 record and 7.04 ERA.
The next audition belongs to 24-year-old Amaury Telemaco,
scheduled to make his Diamondbacks debut as a starter Saturday
against St. Louis. Telemaco was claimed off waivers from the
Chicago Cubs.
The Diamondbacks are now enjoying the fun part that comes from a
stretch like this. Their starters are currently engaged in friendly
competition, each wanting to outdo the other.
