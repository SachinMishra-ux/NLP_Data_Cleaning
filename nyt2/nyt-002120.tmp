The telecommunications companies agreed in 1996 to provide the
low-cost service in return for the Federal Communications
Commission lowering the local access fees long-distance companies
pay to local telephone companies. The lowered access fees were to
save long-distance companies $2.6 billion over 11 months while the
discount to schools and libraries was to cost $2 billion.
Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said the industry
previously agreed to provide the service. He maintained there was
no reason to pass along the surcharge costs to customers.
Clinton also called for large increases in the budgets of the
National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health
for long-term information and communications research. He cited the
discovery this week in Japan that subatomic particles called
neutrinos have mass, a key to the workings of the universe.
Clinton shared commencement duties with Dr. David Ho, who
discovered the drug combination treatment to control AIDS. Ho
accepted MIT's invitation to speak at its commencement last
February but the White House, searching for a venue for Clinton to
speak on the Information revolution, called last month asking to be
included.
After his address, the president had lunch with Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and then joined the first lady to mark the
opening of the Thoreau Institute. Don Henley, former drummer for
the band The Eagles, created the institute and the Walden Woods
Project to preserve the legacy of Henry David Thoreau. XXXX END OF STORY 
SAN FRANCISCO Some habits are hard to break. From the late
1960s to the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead were on the road almost
every year, playing down-home improvisational rock for twirling,
tie-dyed Dead Heads.
Three years after the death of Jerry Garcia, his fellow members
of the Grateful Dead are back together as the core of a new band,
the Other Ones, that sets out to resurrect and extend the Dead's
legacy.
The band made a triumphant hometown debut in San Francisco on
Thursday night at the Warfield Theater for a sold-out house of
2,400 people who arrived with loyal but guarded expectations and
left the concert jubilant.
The Other Ones include Hart, Bob Weir on guitar and Phil Lesh on
bass, Dead members since the 1960s, and Bruce Hornsby on keyboards,
who toured with the Dead in the 1990s. Mark Karan and Steve Kimock
on guitars, Dave Ellis on saxophones and John Molo on drums
complete the new band. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann, the other surviving
founder of the Dead, has retired.
This summer, the new band is to headline the third Furthur
Festival, an annual package tour of Dead-related bands. It goes to
the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 29
and the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on June 30. Hart said
the Other Ones had made no plans beyond the summer.
