The effort was modeled after the campaign used by business
groups to kill Clinton's sweeping health-care proposal in 1994,
demonizing the tobacco plan as big-government intrusion and a
massive tax hike. In the health campaign, business groups spent an
estimated $14 million on television commercials featuring Harry and
Louise, two average people worried about the cost and impact of the
president's proposal.
The ad campaign was only the start. In a surprising tactic, the
industry ads attacked McCain, even though he seemed an unlikely
target as a former prisoner of war in the Vietnam War whom many
consider a hero.
The alliance's strategy reveals much about the way the industry
defeated the bill. The group was primarily responsible for a
massive letter-writing campaign against the legislation. But the
alliance also paid for print and radio advertisements in many
states, including several states with early presidential primaries
and caucuses, such as New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina. The
ads also aired in tobacco-growing states, such as Kentucky, and
swing states represented by senators who could play a key role in
the vote, such as Kansas and Pennsylvania.
The campaign provided critical support for Ashcroft, Gramm, and
Nickles as they blasted the measure on the Senate floor as the
worst tax-and-spend fiasco in decades.
In addition, the tobacco industry flooded Republicans with
campaign contributions. In the current campaign cycle, as of April
1, the industry gave $3.4 million to Republicans and $933,016 to
Democrats.
The contributions had an impact on the senators, according to
Public Citizen, a watchdog group. The organization found that the
34 senators who voted mostly in favor of the tobacco industry
received seven times as much political action committee money as
the 40 senators who voted against the industry most of the time.
Meanwhile, McCain's fragile coalition slowly crumbled. As the
Senate's GOP majority passed a series of amendments by Gramm,
Ashcroft, and other foes of the measure, the bill's breadth and
cost rose, alienating some of the centrists McCain and his allies
were counting on.
The bill's supporters said one of the most damaging amendments,
sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican,
stripped a provision that would have capped the tobacco industry's
annual liability from individual lawsuits at $8 billion. Critics
said the amendment could bankrupt the tobacco industry, a major
concern to a dozen senators from tobacco-growing states, many of
whom once supported the bill.
By Wednesday, when Lott summoned the GOP senators to his office
to consider killing the bill, Republican pollster Linda DiVall had
completed a survey that ran counter to nearly every poll on the
tobacco issue.
DiVall's findings showed respondents, by a margin of 57 percent
to 34 percent, opposed the McCain bill when they were told it would
raise the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over five years and
expand the bureaucracy.
