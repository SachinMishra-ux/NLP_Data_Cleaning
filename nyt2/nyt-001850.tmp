The suit itself challenges only a rule authorizing liveries to
pick up street fares during taxi strikes. The commissioners,
Alberto Torres and Elias Arout, swore that the rule they approved at a May 13 meeting that itself may have been in violation of the
state's open-meeting law was far narrower than the one the city
says was approved.
But the affidavits by sitting commissioners against their own
agency add considerably to the disarray surrounding the mayor's
attempts to win approval for his 17-point package of new safety
rules, two of which have yet to be voted on. And the commissioners'
statements parallel comments they have made questioning the
legality of another closed-door commission meeting, held just
before the vote on the bulk of the mayor's rules.
This week, more than half of the eight commission members said
they were having second thoughts about one rule they approved,
making it much easier to suspend cabbies' licenses. These comments
may be significant, because five votes are needed to pass, amend or
rescind any rules. The commissioners have not yet voted on rules
lowering the threshold for license suspensions and requiring all
yellow cab owners to post a $100,000 insurance bond.
The affidavits and the lawsuit take issue with a rule that was
enacted the day the city's cabbies stayed home to protest the
mayor's proposals. The rule allows the taxi commission to authorize
car services and commuter vans to pick up passengers who hail them
in the street during work stoppages by yellow cabs.
The group filing the suits, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of
Trade, represents the owners of 2,000 yellow cabs. The group says
that actions by the taxi commission and the Giuliani administration
have been rife with secrecy and impropriety.
To begin with, the group's lawyers say, the May 13 meeting,
which was never announced publicly, was in violation of the
open-meetings law, which requires that all meetings of public
bodies be announced as far in advance as practical and made open to
the public.
But beyond that, Arout and Torres said in their affidavits, the
rule approved by the commission allows liveries only to take people
to and from the airports, and only on the day of the meeting. Two
other commissioners have given similar accounts of what took place
at the meeting.
There is no way to verify what actually took place. The city
said in court papers filed Thursday that there were no minutes
taken at the meeting, which is also in conflict with the
open-meetings act. The livery cab rule itself was not drafted until
the day after the meeting. And the commission would not say
Thursday which members had voted for the rule.
Arout said Thursday that he never would have voted for a law
allowing liveries to compete with medallion cabs. While he said he
sympathized with the complaints from both the yellow-cab and livery
industries about the onerousness of the mayor's rules, he said he
filed his affidavit simply to set the record straight.
Torres has said he voiced doubts to the commission's lawyer,
Matthew Daus, as to whether the meeting and the vote were legal,
but that Daus assured him they were.
