Going into Thursday's game, Washburn had done more than hold his
own since replacing the injured Jack McDowell in the starting
rotation on June 2. Washburn pitched into the seventh inning in
each of his first three starts and didn't allow more than three
runs in any of them. The Angels won all three games.
Washburn got the victory in two of them, missing a third win
only because of a fly ball lost in the twilight sky in the ninth
inning on June 8 vs. Colorado that allowed the tying run to score.
The Angels eventually won the game anyway.
Washburn had been particularly good in the opening innings
during his first three starts. He didn't allow a run in innings 1-3
in any of them, but the streak ended Thursday. Griffey turned on a
3-2 fastball from Washburn and put it beyond the short fence down
the line in right field for a 1-0 Mariners lead in the first
inning.
Then in the third, the Mariners batted around and scored four
times. Alex Rodriguez drove home two runs with a bases-loaded
single, Griffey added an RBI single and Jay Buhner had a sacrifice
fly. It could have been worse for the Angels if not for the catch
center fielder Jim Edmonds made on Buhner's deep drive to the
fence. Edmonds lunged and snared the ball before crashing into the
fence.
The Angels scored in the first inning on Salmon's RBI single and
again in the third when DiSarcina singled and eventually scored on
a groundout by Edmonds.
But the Angels trailed 5-2 in the sixth inning when third
baseman Davis handed the Angels a run. With Fielder (double) on
second and two out, Phil Nevin hit a slow roller to Davis. Davis
charged the ball, but it rolled under his glove for a two-base
error, allowing Fielder to score and make it 5-3.
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. It took only 98 years, but the Red Sox
finally played a game in Florida that counted, and won it.
Derek Lowe would prefer not to count his wins by the year, but
for the moment, he has no choice. The last time the Red Sox
righthander won a game, he was pitching for the Seattle Mariners,
Tom Gordon was still a starter, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays were
something you found swimming underwater in the Gulf of Mexico, not
treading water under Teflon-coated fiberglass in Tropicana Field.
The save went to Gordon, his 21st of the season and second in
two nights but first ever after he'd slept in his own bed in nearby
Avon Park.
One Sox player whose ticket was punched early was second baseman
Mike Benjamin, who left the game after striking out to end the top
of the fourth. Manager Jimy Williams said Benjamin jammed his right
wrist sliding into second base on a double-play ball after his RBI
single in the second. X-rays were negative, according to a club
spokesman, who initially had reported that Benjamin did not leave
the game because of injury.
