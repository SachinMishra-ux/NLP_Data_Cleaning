The Woodward family then posed for photographers on their front
stoop under rainy and gray skies, then disappeared into the house.
Later, Woodward withdrew to the bedroom she kept as a teenager,
filled with stuffed animals and lined with posters of British rock
groups Pulp and Pet Shop Boys.
Woodward's arrival home was greeted with near and deliberate
silence from residents. Few villagers were on the street as
Woodward's calvacade drove by.
Many said they are still embarrassed by images of supporters
quaffing champagne and singing soccer victory songs after
Woodward's conviction was reduced to manslaughter six months ago.
Others said they have become disillusioned after allegations that
the Woodwards misused money in their defense fund, and reports that
one of Woodward's lawyers, under arrest for drunken driving,
blurted out that she had come to believe her client was guilty.
AUSTIN Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp are
virtually tied in their race for lieutenant governor with a third
of the likely voters undecided, the Texas Poll indicates.
Republicans lead all the other campaigns for statewide executive
offices, the poll showed, except for the attorney general's race,
where Democrat Jim Mattox is trying to reclaim the post he held for
eight years.
The survey of 691 likely voters was conducted June 1-12 by
Scripps Howard and the Office of Survey Research at the University
of Texas. It did not include judicial races.
Perry, the current state agriculture commissioner, leads Sharp,
the state comptroller, 35 percent to 31 percent, in the race to
succeed Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who is retiring in January.
Perry's support was identical to the 35 percent he received in a
Texas Poll conducted in March, but Sharp dropped 10 percentage
points from his March showing. The level of undecided voters,
meanwhile, increased from 19 percent to 32 percent.
Austin political analyst George Christian said Republican
candidates were benefiting from Gov. George W. Bush's popularity at
the top of the GOP ticket. Bush has a 53-point lead over Democratic
challenger Garry Mauro, according to the same poll.
Christian said Mattox, who won two races for attorney general in
the 1980s and ran unsuccessfully for governor and U.S. senator
since then, led partly because he is better known than Cornyn.
