Prodded by the computer industry, the telephone and cable
television industries have been rushing to develop new ways to link
homes to cyberspace at speeds that far exceed those possible using
today's common modems.
The nation's large local phone carriers have joined with Compaq
Computer Corp., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in a group called
the Universal ADSL Consortium in an attempt to deliver torrents of
data over phone wires. Many of the nation's largest cable
television companies have formed a venture called At Home to do the
same thing using cable systems.
But those initiatives have done little to address how computers
and other advanced electronic devices communicate within homes. The
consortium being announced Monday plans to use telephone wiring to
create fast in-home networks.
The group plans to publish its first technical standards in the
third quarter and expects its members to ship products based on the
technology by the end of the year.
Compaq, for instance, could include plug-in cards in its
computers that allow users to make an in-home network simply by
plugging computers into standard telephone jacks.
The consortium expects its efforts to enable data-transmission
rates of up to one megabit a second. That is more than 20 times the
speeds generally made possible by today's telephone modems but is
much slower than the speeds used in modern office networks.
Carpenter said the technology would allow people to use their
telephones in the standard fashion even as the same wires carry
Internet data between machines.
Tony Grewe, an applications strategy manager for Lucent
Technology Inc.'s microelectronics unit, said the group at Lucent
that was working with the new group was separate from the task
force working with the ADSL consortium, but that the two groups
consult regularly.
Besides games, most people would seem to have little use for a
quick in-home network if the home itself had no high-speed link to
the outside world.
The core technology for the group's efforts is being provided by
two small private companies, Tut Systems Inc., based in Pleasant
Hill, Calif., and Epigram Inc., based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The
other members of the group are 3Com Corp., Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., ATT Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel and Rockwell
International.
