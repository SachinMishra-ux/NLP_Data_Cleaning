The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing maybe cutting the throats of the 10 percent Serb minority.
Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu Kashmir from seceding?
All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
