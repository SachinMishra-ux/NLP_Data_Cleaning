His average finish on superspeedways tracks of 1.5 miles or
longer is third if the 31st at TMS last year is disregarded
He has finished in the top five in all seven truck races this
year, including a victory at the NAPACARD 200 in Monroe, Wash., on
May 9. His average finish this year is 3.14.
The statistics show that Sprague finished fifth at the Parts
America 150 last week at Watkins Glen. What the stats don't show is
a charge reminiscent of what he did at TMS last year.
Sprague started fifth, but had a flat tire on the 15th lap. By
the time he got into the pits and got out again he was back in 32nd
place.
He didn't stay there long. He immediately began to pass trucks,
a feat that can be difficult on a road course, and eventually kept
alive the string of top-five finishes.
LOS ANGELES -- Thirty years ago today, a bullet felled Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel, the last in a chain of
assassinations that robbed many Americans of their political
idealism and optimism.
So it's no surprise that those who were with Kennedy on that
tragic night are feeling melancholy about how little has changed
since June 5, 1968 -- from the fragmented state of race relations
to the unresolved controversy that surrounds the senator's death.
Thirty years ago, Kennedy was at the Ambassador Hotel to claim
victory in California's presidential primary. As he left through
the hotel's kitchen pantry, he passed Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian
immigrant enraged by Kennedy's support for Israel.
Shots were fired, and Kennedy collapsed. Sirhan ran, but was
wrestled to the ground by Grier and others. Kennedy died 26 hours
later. Sirhan was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
If anything, recent events surrounding RFK's death have added
fuel to the conspiracy theorists, who are still demanding a new
government investigation into the three-decade-old crime. Today
through Sunday, the Coalition on Political Assassinations will
convene at the Continental Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles to trade its
latest theories.
