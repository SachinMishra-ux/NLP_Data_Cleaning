Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said that it was highly unusual for
members of government agencies to file affidavits challenging their
own rules.
Freeman said that taken together with an hourlong closed-door
meeting on May 28 just before the panel approved 15 of the 17
points of Giuliani's plan, the commission's behavior represented a
disturbing pattern.
WASHINGTON They call them the Righteous Brothers. James
Dobson, Gary Bauer and John Ashcroft are the vanguard of a new
conservative Christian movement that is marching on Washington.
Social conservatives feel that the Republican Party has taken
them for granted, led them down the garden path and given nothing
back in return.
They want an end to abortion, gay rights and gun control, and
their demands are causing uproar in the party as America gears up
for elections.
Dobson, 62, is a broadcaster based in Colorado Springs, Colo.
Bauer, 51, a former Reagan Administration official, heads the
Family Research Council. Ashcroft, 56, is a senator from Missouri.
They are the heirs to a tradition of religious conservatism in
America that helped keep Ronald Reagan in office for eight years.
But they feel that the party Reagan included scorned them,
refusing to adopt their key demands, and that the Republican
party's candidate in the 1996 Presidential race, Robert Dole,
betrayed the cause.
It intersects with the political universe when candidates are
being nominated, and small groups of highly motivated individuals
can be very influential.
The Righteous Brothers have money, and they have an audience.
Bauer's Political Action Committee, the Campaign for Working
Families, has raised $3.7 million in contributions in a year.
Nearly 6 million people listen to Dobson's radio show every day;
millions more have bought his books.
But what has made them important is, in some ways, the weakness
of the conservative Christian leadership. Pat Robertson, its star
in the 1980s, has been in eclipse for years. His Christian
Coalition, once the moving force behind the religious right, lost
influence and became regarded by many as too willing to compromise.
