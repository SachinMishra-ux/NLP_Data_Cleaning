Three rows behind him, Xu Guangli, an administrator and a joint
venture company, and Sun Huawei, an assistant to a labor
arbitrator, both 24, discussed their weekend plans. They can not
afford to go abroad, they said, but try to take weekend trips each
month, either on organized tours or by renting cars with friends.
Fei Zinggang, the hand-shaking manager of Tai He Travel, said
his small state-owned travel agency started offering weekend tours
last June when it sensed a market demand and in peak season now
sends out up to 80 travelers a weekend.
The parents at the 21st-Century Experimental School say they
selected the school for its emphasis on creative thinking and
independence not traditional Chinese values.
Zang, the real-estate entrepreneur, who is an avid reader, said
that one of the biggest excitements for him is no longer having to
check the price of books before buying them.
Ms. Zhang, the writer, sounds like an excited teenager as she
describes the sense of freedom that has come with her car: trips to
galleries and to plays, carefree jaunts around a homeland that she
had never explored before.
TOKYO In a few weeks, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
face nationwide elections as he presides over the worst recession
in more than 50 years, a limp stock market and the highest
unemployment rate since records began to be kept.
Yet experts overwhelmingly expect his governing Liberal
Democratic Party to do very well. The latest polls show it with
more than five times as much support as any other party.
Now Hashimoto is more likely to do better than ever, for
President Clinton handed him a political gift on Wednesday by
agreeing to a joint U.S.-Japanese campaign to bolster the sagging
yen. Whether or not the jawboning and billions of dollars in
foreign-exchange intervention succeed in propping up the yen, they
will almost certainly succeed in propping up Hashimoto.
The premise of Clinton's decision to go to Hashimoto's aid was
that Japan would take, as Clinton put it, aggressive and bold steps
that would justify a higher rate for the yen. But many analysts
here say that the Japanese political process militates against
fundamental change and that Hashimoto's relative popularity
suggests that the public wants someone like him, a repairman for
the old system rather than an architect for a new one.
All this raises some puzzling questions about the Japanese
political process. In most countries there is a built-in corrective
mechanism when an economy veers off course. Disgruntled voters
evict the old team and choose new leaders who promise to do things
differently. Yet despite eight years of economic stagnation the
Japanese political system has not responded in that way.
