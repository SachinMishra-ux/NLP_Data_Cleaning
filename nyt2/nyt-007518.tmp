Meanwhile, in the middle of it all are the players and coaches,
the majority of whom have announced that they will try to spurn
FIFA's World Cup edict of immediately leaving the field in favor of
an age-old soccer tradition trading jerseys at the final whistle.
Of course. But today the world will watch these nations play
soccer because of the way things were from 1979-1981 and what it
has done to these political nemeses since.
SAN FRANCISCO Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks watched his
chance to move into contention during the third round disappear
with a triple bogey at the 288-yard seventh hole, the shortest
par-4 at the Olympic Club.
Brooks pulled his drive into a bush, forcing him to take an
unplayable lie. His recovery shot kicked into the rough and Brooks
eventually three-putted for a seven. After playing the first six
holes at even par, Brooks was 6 over on the final 12, dropping to
12 over for the tournament.
Brooks' third-round highlight proved to be an 18-foot chip-in
for birdie from the rough surrounding the 13th green.
Tiger Woods, meanwhile, opened with a birdie and did not take
another in his final 17 holes. He registered consecutive bogeys at
Nos. 3 and 4, then parred in to shoot 71 and drop to 7 over.
Woods, who did not three-putt during his victory at the 1997
Masters, has two four-putts and three three-putts on his card at
the 1998 Open.
Rolling with Casey Perhaps appropriately, disabled golfer Casey
Martin played the third round with the only player in the field who
might have an inkling of what his physical condition would be like:
Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal.
Olazabal's career was presumed over in 1996, when he was unable
to walk 18 holes without severe pain because of what was initially
diagnosed as severe arthritis. Eventually, Olazabal's condition
improved and he returned to the European Tour in 1997 after an
18-month absence.
Martin, who suffers from a rare circulatory disorder that makes
it difficult for him to walk, was granted a federal court order in
February allowing him to use a cart in competition at professional
events.
Chris Perry recorded the first hole-in-one of the tournament by
knocking a 6-iron into the cup at the 176-yard 13th hole. It marked
his third career ace in tournament competition but his first at the
Open.
