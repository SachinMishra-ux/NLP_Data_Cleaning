Real Quiet became the 14th horse to lose the Triple Crown in the
Belmont and the sixth since the last successful bid by Affirmed in
1978. Since Affirmed beat Alydar in a classic stretch battle,
Spectacular Bid (1979), Pleasant Colony (1981), Alysheba (1987),
Sunday Silence (1989), Silver Charm (1997), and Real Quiet have
failed.
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. Willie Clay is grateful that only one of the
major defections from the Patriots this offseason came on defense,
cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock, who was dealt to the Minnesota Vikings
for a third-round draft pick.
For if more had, Clay knows the defense would have felt the
impact, much like the offense knows it will now.
Clay, who Sunday took part in the final day of mandatory
minicamp before more than 22,000 season ticket-holders at Foxboro
Stadium, said he also will miss Hitchcock, a neighbor in the locker
room and on the field.
Because first-round draft pick Tebucky Jones was injured early
in Friday's session (pulled left hamstring), Clay didn't have a
chance to form an early opinion as to whether Jones can handle the
job.
Canty, who had been buried on the left side behind Ty Law, had a
chance to play with the first defense at right corner during
minicamp and played well. He's trying to change the opinions of
those who believe the Patriots made a mistake by making him their
first-round pick last year.
The feeling after the camp is that the defense is ahead of the
offense, something that may be heard often during training camp in
Smithfield, R.I.
The focus of minicamp was mainly on the offense, particularly
rookie running back Robert Edwards. Eyes also were following Drew
Bledsoe, as always, wide receiver Terry Glenn, and the offensive
line, which must come to make holes for the new halfback.
For the first time in three years, the Patriots are running the
same defense for the second straight year. The constant changing of
schemes had taken its toll on some players. Now, rather than having
to learn a new style, they can just concentrate on improving.
 Billerica, Mass., now may be in Tom Glavine's rear-view
mirror, but it's never out of sight. And certainly not out of his
thoughts.
