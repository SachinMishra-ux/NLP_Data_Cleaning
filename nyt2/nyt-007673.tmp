According to a lawyer familiar with the negotiations, the owners
want to install a hard salary cap, essentially a fixed amount each
team can spend in a season, without exceptions. Over the next two
or three seasons, teams would also like to phase out the Larry Bird
exception, in which teams can pay their own free agents whatever
they want, regardless of the salary cap.
For the owners, the ultimate goal is to reduce salaries over a
three-year period so that they do not exceed 48 percent to 50
percent of revenues. They also would like to limit individual
salaries so that one or two players do not gobble up all the money
on a roster.
Whereas the owners see their proposals as finally bringing some
economic balance to a league of $100 million-or-bust contracts, the
players view the approach as taking back what it is already theirs.
This is what preparation for the NBA has come to: A guy who had
not played five-on-five basketball until two years ago may end up
going No. 1 in Wednesday's draft.
Now hedging on whether they will select Arizona point guard Mike
Bibby with the first pick, the Los Angeles Clippers may take the
University of Pacific's 7-foot-1-inch Nigerian, Michael Olowokandi,
this week in Vancouver, British Columbia.
The club is said to be divided on which player it will choose,
leaving the door open for the first five or six selections.
Vancouver, which is said to be interested in taking the Kansas
forward Paul Pierce at No. 2, is still entertaining offers from
teams for its pick. The Denver Nuggets, who have the third pick,
are worried the Toronto Raptors will move up from No. 4 to No. 2 in
order to take Olowokandi or Bibby, thus forcing them to take Pierce
instead of the big man they covet.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Firefighters raced to one blaze after
another Sunday as brush fires likely started by lightning burned near the Palm Beach Gardens Municipal Golf Course and in
woods around Jupiter Middle School.
Two Palm Beach County Fire Rescue units also were sent north to
Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Martin County, where they helped
control a 20-acre fire in the 640-acre Girl Scout camp. A 30-acre
fire also broke out in the Dupree Reserve in Indiantown, Martin
County fire rescue workers said.
No homes were destroyed, no people hurt. But Northern Palm Beach
County and parts of Martin County fell under a heavy haze of brush
fire smoke.
The fire near Jupiter Middle School started at about 12:30 p.m.
as two smaller fires about 1,000 feet apart, Smith said. But by 4
p.m., the fires had merged, winds stoked the fire to about 10
acres. At times, the blaze moved dangerously close to portable
classrooms on the south side of the campus.
