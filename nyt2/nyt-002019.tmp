OBIT-POVICH (Undated) Shirley Povich, a member of the writers
wing of baseball's Hall of Fame and whose career as a sports writer
covered more than 75 years at The Washington Post, died of a heart
attack. He was 92. By Ira Berkow.
Ward Connerly has made quite a name for himself, his caramel
brown face now synonymous with the fight to end racial and gender
preferences.
I turn the 58-year-old Connerly's words over in my mind and
think he's either asleep or mad.
What reasonable man can deny based on declining minority
enrollment at both Texas and California universities that
admissions based solely on test scores exclude most minority
students?
In 1995, Connerly won his fight to ban affirmative action at the
University of California. A year later, voters even supported him
when he headed the Proposition 209 initiative to end the practice
in all state and local government programs in California.
But this is not the time to eliminate the one tool we have to
help level the playing field for many minority youths. Luckily,
politicians elsewhere like U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla. have
recognized this and have backed away from such proposals.
Connerly, a University of California regent and businessman,
seems nice enough. He has worked hard to get where he is, once
working for 65 cents an hour to help keep a roof over his head.
But Connerly's contention that there is no greater insult than
to be accepted into college or given a job because of one's skin
color is wrong. The greater insult would be to not be given the
job, to not be admitted to college at all, because of your color.
Because of preferences, minorities like Connerly and, I should
also add, white women have been afforded opportunities they would
not have otherwise had.
What hasn't changed is the fact that too many minorities are all
too willing to be used by white racists to obscure mean and
socially harmful agendas. That allows them a program that would
otherwise be characterized as bald racism were it not decorated
with a self-loathing black face.
