But here is where this impromptu stage works its magic. Gorilla
Mom decided her baby was getting too precocious. He had climbed a
tree and was acting too sure of himself. She plucked him from the
tree, looked directly our way, then scampered off with the baby
latched onto her arm, the same way he had hugged the tree limb.
Written in chalk, it is updated frequently and offers tips on
how long you can expect to wait for a particular ride. It also will
tell you what might be the next, best thing to do at that
particular time based on crowd size and weather elements. And you
can always bide some time, as we did, back at the Tree of Life.
This is the park's centerpiece that towers 145 feet in the air
(that's about 14 stories) and has 325 images of animals, including
birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. The man-made tree evokes
the same kind of game you might play with your family on a long car
ride when trying to figure out images in clouds.
Inside the trunk, you'll be given bug-eyed 3-D glasses. The
movie takes you inside the world of insects and it's complete with
many effects, including the sights, sounds and even smells (watch
out for this one) of the bug world. We had multiday Disney passes
and lofty ideas about maybe hitting the Magic Kingdom later in the
afternoon, but Animal Kingdom is vast. We discovered midway through
our travels that you should plan on spending the entire day at this
park. It's also best to get an early start. The park opens at 7
a.m. It closes at 8 p.m.
It is somewhat difficult to maneuver Animal Kingdom and we spent
a lot of our time using the map and trying to figure out how to get
from point A to point B. The landscape of this park is more winding
and hilly.
We stumbled upon Camp Mickey-Minnie. The idea here is that the
Disney characters are vacationing in the Adirondacks and you can
visit with them for an autograph or a photo shoot. Some walk the
grounds while others are at little campgrounds where a short stay
in line can get you an autograph or a photo op. Although we didn't
have any small children with us, we decided it was worth the stand
in line to get a snapshot with Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse
dressed in hiking gear.
Here you are a scientist given the assignment of saving the last
animatronic dinosaur from extinction when the crash of a fiery
asteroid threatens Earth. The vehicle twists and turns. Watch out
for that pterodactyl, we've narrowly missed the carnotaurus, we've
got to save the iguanodon.
SAN FRANCISCO A security company that asked its applicants a
series of questions about their political beliefs settled a
class-action lawsuit for up to $2.1 million, a case that could
change the way corporations around the country screen job
candidates.
The settlement, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, will pay up to 8,000 job applicants as much as $1,250 as
part of an agreement reached between the American Civil Liberties
Union and Burns International Security Services, a subsidiary of
Borg-Warner Protective Services Corporation, the nation's largest
security company.
A statement from Borg-Warner said the company denied all
liability in the lawsuit and follows all state and federal
employment laws.
Lead plaintiff Mel Thompson, 38, said he took the test at the
company's San Francisco office in 1993 and was offended by the
questions and refused to answer many of them.
