The Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday night passed the
bill by a vote of 55-6, and a large majority of Assembly members
are known to favor the measure, which has been kept from a vote by
the leadership in recent years. Gov. George Pataki, a Republican,
also favors the bill in concept, but aides said he would not
comment on it until his lawyers had read it.
In addition to the HIV tracking measure, legislative leaders
also agreed to create an appeals process for people who are denied
health insurance and to expand health care for poor children.
But as the Senate and Assembly met late into the night to
conclude what many legislators called a singularly unproductive
year, leaders of the two houses and Pataki failed to agree on a
wide range of measures that appeared possible, even likely, as
recently as a day or two ago: ending parole for violent felons,
establishing charter schools, consolidation of the state's
multilayered court system, allowing dairy farmers to charge more
for milk, and permitting mutual insurance companies to sell
billions of dollars in stock.
But it was a bitter internal fight over HIV legislation among
the Democrats who control the Assembly that occupied much of the
last two days in that house, and provided the greatest drama on the
final day.
After years of resisting the concept, the Democrats who control
the Assembly said their house would pass the bill requiring
reporting, by name, of people infected with the AIDS virus, to the
state Health Department, which would keep a central registry of the
names of infected people.
Local health agencies would be required to interview all people
reported as testing positive, ask them to name their sexual
partners, and then warn those partners that they have been exposed
to the virus. But the law would not penalize anyone who refused to
divulge the names of their sexual partners.
Twenty-eight other states, including New Jersey, already track
HIV cases by name, but many of those do not mandate the tracing of
contacts. Passage of the measure in New York would be significant
since it has the nation's highest rate of reported AIDS cases.
Public health officials have said that reporting by name and
tracing contacts are needed to make sure that people are aware that
they have been exposed to the virus, in part to reduce the risk of
spreading the infection. Early detection of the virus is considered
increasingly important since a new class of AIDS drugs called
protease inhibitors has proven effective in treating the disease in
many people.
AIDS-treatment advocacy groups have fought the measure, arguing
that it would discourage people from being tested and seeking
treatment. Some said patients could be effectively tracked without
using their names, by assigning them identification codes. But
supporters of the bill said such a system would be cumbersome and
might hinder the ability to track the spread of the disease.
It has long been clear that such a bill had enough votes to pass
the Assembly nearly all the 53 Republicans and most of the 97
Democrats favor it but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver kept it
from coming to a vote for years.
