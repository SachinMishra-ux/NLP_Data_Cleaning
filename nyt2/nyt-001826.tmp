When John Carro was named a Criminal Court judge in 1968 by
Mayor John Lindsay, he was one of only two or three Puerto Rican
judges in the city and the first from the Bronx.
He enjoyed telling off a district attorney as much as telling a
riotous story in chambers. His battles with Mario Merola, the
former Bronx district attorney, were so protracted that the court
administration felt it better to transfer him to Manhattan, where
he eventually rose to become the state's highest-ranking Puerto
Rican judge, serving 16 years in the appellate division. And when
two New York senators nominated him to become a federal judge in
1988, the Reagan and Bush administrations sat on his nomination for
three years, telling him they were not interested in activist
judges. He finally withdrew his name angrily in 1991.
Greg Carro, by contrast, has entered the judiciary in an era of
lower volume and more relaxed expectations. There are now about 40
Hispanic judges in the city not enough for his father, but enough
to ease some of the role-model pressure from his shoulders.
He is reserved and careful where his father was outspoken and
colorful, and his views on maintaining an ethnic balance on the
courts are more in tune with the man who appointed him to the
$103,800-a-year job, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
Greg Carro, who is 38, said he did not even realize his father
was an outspoken liberal when he was growing up. By then, the Carro
family had moved from the Bronx to a more spacious home in Yonkers,
later moving again to the far suburbs of Rockland County, and the
judge did not bring his politics or his cases home to the kitchen
table.
The seven children in the family had the kind of comfortable
middle-class existence John Carro never knew as a child, and there
was never any question but that they would enter the kinds of
professions their father had aspired to. (Of the seven, four are
lawyers and one is a doctor.)
It's a familiar pattern of assimilation, but the pathway is
rarely as thoroughly paved by one generation for another.
Unlike his father, a former defense lawyer, Greg Carro came to
the law through the enforcement side. He has been a prosecutor
since graduating from Rutgers Law School in 1985, first for the
city's special narcotics prosecutor and most recently for the
Manhattan district attorney's office, and he has made a specialty
of successfully prosecuting drug gangs. After 13 years on the job,
he submitted his name as a candidate for a judgeship, seeing it as
a logical progression from his work as a prosecutor and his
father's ideals of public service.
There is one page of the storybook that applies, however: the
son will be getting his father's robe.
For six hours a day, nearly every day since he decided in
January to run for the 20th Congressional District seat, Feiner has
been on the telephone trying to raise the $600,000 that his
advisers say he needs to unseat the Republican incumbent, Rep.
Benjamin Gilman.
