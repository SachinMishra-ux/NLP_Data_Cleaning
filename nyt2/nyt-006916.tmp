If they don't return, among the options USA Basketball is
considering is suing the individual players for breach of contract.
If that won't get Payton double ornery, nothing will.
Hard to know where the lockout, as well as the other variables,
will leave the Sonics by November. But if it gets really bad,
Westphal still has his bedpan.
The guy in the funny clothes Thursday mocked the torture chamber
known as the 98th U.S. Open, sidestepping the unforgiving rough and
striding jauntily through the eucalyptus and cyprus trees. He
didn't stop until climbing atop the first-round leaderboard with a
four-under-par 66.
That was good for a one-shot edge over Mark Carnevale. That was
reason enough for the USGA to consider testing only his equipment.
Stewart, 41 and in decline since winning a pair of majors, made
it look easy when things were meant to be flat-out miserable.
Player after player had declared Olympic's four-foot rough as
unfair as any ever encountered on the tour. Par golf was predicted.
With a shrug and a 2-iron, the carefree Stewart barely flinched
on a cool, overcast day in the Bay Area.
Stewart also was uncommonly good as he finished. He birdied the
last three holes on the course, something done only once before by Denis Watson at Olympic's 1987 U.S. Open. He birdied the par-4,
468-yard 17th a feat matched by only three others, Carnevale,
Jason Allen and Chris Tidland. He was one of nine players among the
156 to break par, and his 66 was the lowest first-round score in
four Olympic Opens.
And he seemed to greatly enjoy himself and his new-found
success. Meeting with reporters, Stewart feigned mock horror when
USGA official Les Unger pointed out that it had been a couple years
since he had been in the U.S. Open press tent.
Rightly so. He had finished well out of the running in the
previous four U.S. Opens, with 21st his best effort. He had won
only once on the tour over the past seven years, since claiming the
1991 U.S. Open in a playoff with Scott Simpson (his other major
victory was the 1989 PGA Championship). In his most recent outing,
The Memorial, he had shot an 83, taking a 10 on one hole.
Thursday, Stewart was a new man. He was dressed the same as
usual, wearing one of his trademark ensembles, a blue and plaid
look, complete with cap and knickers. But his game was sharper,
mixing pinpoint accuracy, great resilience and, admittedly, dumb
luck in piecing together a five-birdie, one-bogey effort.
