 By CARLTON THOMPSON c. 1998, Houston Chronicle SAN DIEGO Mike Hampton's command abandoned him on day when Andy
Ashby happened to be conducting a seminar on the subject.
In a nutshell, that summed up the Astros' 5-1 loss to the San
Diego Padres on Thursday at Qualcomm Stadium.
Ashby lectured the Astros' bats with an assortment of pitches
that ranked among the best they had seen all season. The
righthander sprinkled eight hits over nine innings to notch his
third consecutive complete game and his fourth of the season.
Moises Alou's homer leading off the ninth inning spoiled Ashby's
shutout bid, but that was about the only mistake the hot-handed
pitcher made all day.
For one of the few times this season, Hampton was at the other
end of the spectrum although he still managed to keep the Astros
close. Hampton held the Padres to five hits in 6 innings, but he
walked five batters.
Two of the walks led to runs, but they proved to be meaningless.
Ashby got all the run support he needed in the first inning when
Greg Vaughn hit a two-run homer to left.
The loss cut the Astros' National League Central Division lead
over the idle Chicago Cubs to one game and left them with a 3-3
record on the six-game road trip to Colorado and San Diego.
The Astros missed Padres ace Kevin Brown, but they couldn't
dodge the hottest pitcher in San Diego's rotation. Ashby, who had
eight strikeouts Thursday, is 2-1 with a 1.73 ERA in his last three
starts.
With the exception of Alou's 12th homer, the Astros didn't get a
runner into scoring position after the second inning.
The Astros got off to an inauspicious start when Quilvio Veras
led off first with what appeared to be a bloop single. Center
fielder Carl Everett charged the ball and nearly made the play, but
it got past him and Veras was credited with a double.
