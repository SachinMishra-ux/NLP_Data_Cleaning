At present, Chrein said, the basic package being offered by
CNYCSites allows members to choose from three predesigned templates
into which individual buildings can insert whatever information
they choose.
Generally, Chrein said, the first page the home page contains information about the building, pictures or illustrations,
and links to other Internet sites. The second page, he said,
usually contains a bulletin board for listings of meetings,
activities and events and for posting apartments for sale or
sublet.
Additional pages can be added so that other information including building bylaws, proprietary leases and rules and
regulations can be instantly accessed by clicking on a link to
the desired page.
For members of the Council of New York Cooperatives, he said,
the one-time charge for designing a two-page site is $400. In
addition, Chrein said, member sites can be updated monthly for an
annual fee of $175. Additional information may be obtained by
calling CNYCSites at (212) 787-3462.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. First of all, when you hear about 65-year-old
Lou Joline competing in 100-mile treks across the mountainous West,
or his goal, some two-thirds completed, of running in a marathon in
every state, do not become despondent.
But in the face of Joline's accomplishments, the danger is
you'll shake your head in despair, then slump back into your
recliner.
OK, so here's Joline's story. About 20 years ago he started
noticing an expanding paunch, so familiar to many in their 40s and
beyond. To be perfectly honest, he needed to drop 35 pounds.
Joline started running, and little by little he lost the extra
pounds. He's stayed a trim 130 ever since. About three years into
his exercise regimen, while in Lawrence for a 10-kilometer
(6.2-mile) race, he noticed the event also included a marathon. He
decided to give it a shot. He did quite well, considering he hadn't
planned to run 26 miles that day.
Now he's completed 61 marathons in 31 states. For a real
challenge he runs races up and down Pikes Peak or enters 100-mile
competitions that grind on for 20 hours or more, like the one
coming up in August at Leadville, Colo. There's something wonderful
about running and clambering through a mountain forest, Joline
said. Not to mention incredibly challenging.
But don't worry too much about Joline. In fact, at this point
you can forget his story entirely and listen to Kristine Clark.
She's director of sports nutrition at Pennsylvania State University
and one of the judges who pored over thousands of entries in the
Knox NutraJoint Senior Fitness Search.
