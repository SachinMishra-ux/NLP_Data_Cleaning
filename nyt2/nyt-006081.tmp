SALAMANDER-POEM AUSTIN U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin

and a personalized Bible, with the Red Sea miracle flagged by a
yellow Post-It note, and marches down the middle of West 33rd,
filling dealers and admirers alike with dread. (Trontz, Palm Beach
