At Agnes B., on Greene Street in Soho, a narrow-brim hat, $83,
has an old-fashioned shape, but made in black leather, it has a
sharp, rakish cool.
At the venerable milliner Worth Worth, on Madison Avenue at
43rd Street, summer hat styles range from a simple, smart cotton
driving cap, $30, to a panoply of Panama hats in varying weaves,
styles and prices. A Baku straw snap-brim is $145, while Panama
Montecristi hats can cost up to $1,000, depending on the fineness
of the weave and of the jipijapa, the straw from which Panamas are
made.
At Bergdorf Goodman, the finest Panama hat is $495 and can be
squashed in a suitcase, within reason, and still snap back into
shape. A cowboy-style Panama with a leather hatband is $195 and has
a novel charm.
For those who still cling to the Gilligan ideal but want to
upgrade, Paul Stuart, on Madison Avenue at 45th Street, has a
waterproof fishing hat in a sleek black oiled cotton, $27.50. And
Prada sells a fishing-style hat in black or brown nylon for $214 perfect for those who feel marooned without a designer label.
This is a car of surprises. At first glance, it reminds this
columnist of something British from the 1960s. It's from the other
end of the world.
It's slick, sleek, outfitted to the nines, and it exhibits very
fine road manners; it is a much better car than I would have
expected from a company called Daewoo. I had never seen a luxury
car from Daewoo nor do I remember a true luxury automobile from
any Korean manufacturer. At least, I had never driven one. Frankly,
I had expected a lot less than this Daewoo Laganza delivered.
The minimal expectations do not spring from any antipathy to
things Korean but from earlier experience with a Daewoo automobile a tinny little bucket dubbed Pontiac LeMans. Daewoo early on had
a partnership of sorts with General Motors, and it was a Daewoo of
small virtue that inherited the muscle car moniker during one of
GM's many product reshufflings. It was at best a very bad joke.
Daewoo has moved away from GM and looked toward a Porsche
executive, Ulrich Bez, for design expertise; Laganza, therefore, is
no joke but a fairly accurate Korean quotation of a European car.
There were a couple of other surprises, too. Although the price
of Laganza has not been set as of this writing, it may be a bargain
in today's market. The Americans in Daewoo want to price it around
$17,000; the Koreans see $20K as more reasonable an asking price.
Somewhere in the middle, would still be low for a nicely styled
five-passenger sedan with air conditioning, power everything, and
other amenities. The tested Laganza came with leather and a CD
player; perhaps those are meant to be options, perhaps not.
That brings us to the other surprise or disappointment: The
columnist is roadtesting a vehicle that isn't yet available. In
fact, the first New England dealership isn't open yet. The car is
expected to go on sale around Sept. 1.
