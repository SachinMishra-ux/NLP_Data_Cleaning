After a night to sleep on the result, Baffert still refused to
second-guess anything with Real Quiet, from his own training to the
ride of Kent Desormeaux. Baffert missed the Triple Crown last year
when Silver Charm ran second in the Belmont after taking the Derby
and Preakness. 
Real Quiet left Belmont at 6:30 a.m. Sunday and was flown to
Louisville, Ky., and Churchill Downs, where he will rest for a week
before rejoining Baffert's large stable in Southern California.
Victory Gallop is flying to Kentucky, where Walden is based. But
both will be headed East again soon.
Victory Gallop is likely to make his next start in the $1
million Haskell Invitational at a mile and one-eighth at New
Jersey's Monmouth Park on Aug. 9, then go to the Travers, Walden
said. Baffert said Real Quiet would definitely be at the Travers.
Also ticketed for a trip to the Haskell is the mercurial
Coronado's Quest, who returned to action on Saturday and won the
seven-furlong Riva Ridge Stakes on the Belmont undercard.
Coronado's Quest has had a spring filled with high drama. His
erratic behavior compromised his chances in races in Florida
earlier this year and led to a decision not to run him in the
Kentucky Derby. Then he was scratched from the Preakness because of
a bruised foot.
Coronado's Quest's victory on Saturday was efficient if
unspectacular, but his deportment before 80,162 fans was
exemplary in both the saddling paddock and post parade.
He said Coronado's Quest would run once before the Haskell, in
Belmont's $150,000 Dwyer Stakes, at a mile and one-sixteenth, on
July 12.
Favorite Trick also is expected to run in the Dwyer. The 1997
Horse of the Year, he has not raced since finishing eighth in the
Kentucky Derby.
Lil's Lad, who was disqualified from victory in the Florida
Derby earlier this year, will join the party last of all. He needed
minor ankle surgery after his second-place finish in the Blue Grass
Stakes, and only in the past week has he gone back to the track to
train. His trainer, Neil Howard, said Lil's Lad probably would not
be ready to race until late August or early September, near the end
of the Saratoga meeting.
The hubbub of chatter stopped. As Ausfahl strummed his guitar,
the roisterous kindergartners at Public School 114 in the Bronx
lifted their faces in delight. Accompanying him were Brian Grice on
the drums and Sue Terry on the flute. Between songs, they taught
the rudiments of their instruments.
Jeff Ausfahl has played the guitar professionally for 25 years.
He is what is known as a club date musician, who primarily performs
at single engagements like weddings and private parties. A highly
malleable guitarist, he can play everything from dance to rock to
classical to merengue to polkas. He plays songs of contagious cheer
and songs with a lot of ache in them, though he no longer gets to
perform anywhere as much as he would like to. Such is the sharply
altered shape of the musician's life in a world more in thrall to
canned music than live.
