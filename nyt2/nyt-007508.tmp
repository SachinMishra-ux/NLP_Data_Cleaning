The accident happened shortly after 4 a.m. on a mountainous,
rain-slicked part of the turnpike about 50 miles west of
Harrisburg, Pa. The bus, carrying 23 people from New York City to
Pittsburgh, crashed into the rear of a tractor-trailer parked on
the shoulder, near a tunnel. The accident injured 18 people,
including 2 who were asleep in the truck cab.
The names of the other victims, including Wisner's wife, who was
56, and his son, were not released. The authorities said some might
not be identified until Monday.
The injured included a 34-year-old man from Elmhurst, N.Y., who
was listed in critical condition at the Washington County Hospital,
in Hagerstown, Md. A hospital representative declined to reveal the
man's name. Another person was listed in stable condition at the
hospital and 16 were treated for minor injuries.
Late Saturday afternoon, the police were still investigating the
crash. Greyhound officials declined to speculate on a cause, but
dismissed a theory that the driver might have fallen sleep. The
officials said that the company followed strict federal highway
safety regulations that permit employees to drive only 10 hours in
a 24-hour period and 70 hours in an eight-day period.
A Greyhound spokesman, George Gravley, said Wisner's personnel
file had been sent to the National Transportation Safety Board,
which is investigating the accident along with a team from
Greyhound.
Wisner began his last run on Thursday night, when he drove from
Pittsburgh, his home base, to New York City. He arrived in New York
early Friday morning and spent 13 hours in the city before heading
out to Pittsburgh at 9 p.m. on Friday, Gravley said.
The tractor-trailer was parked on a wide shoulder, a mile west
of the Tuscarora Tunnel. The road was wet from rain earlier in the
morning. Lt. Richard Kovalik of the state police said it was common
practice, and legal, for trucks to pull off the road onto the
shoulder.
Scott Elarton's shot at winning his major-league debut got
caught up in a tangled mess created by the bullpen, but the elastic
Astros refused to break in their 22nd come-from-behind victory of
the season.
Hot-hitting Carl Everett's three-run double capped a four-run
eighth inning and sent the Astros on their way to a wacky 9-8
victory over the Cincinnati Reds Saturday afternoon at the
Astrodome. Billy Wagner surrendered two runs in the ninth but held
on for his 18th save of the season.
The Astros, who moved to 17 games over .500 for the first time
since 1994, have won 12 games in their last at-bat this season.
