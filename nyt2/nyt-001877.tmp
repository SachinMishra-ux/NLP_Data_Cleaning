Other Midwesterners invited by White House and congressional
organizers to participate include Missouri Sen. William Clay of St.
Louis; Sheryl Davenport, president of the St. Louis teachers union;
and Mike Fitzgerald, Iowa's treasurer.
They will map out an aggressive public awareness campaign to
warn U.S. workers that they will need personal savings as well as
Social Security and pension income to live comfortably in
retirement.
Summit participants also will be asked to explore ways that
businesses can reduce barriers that keep many workers from saving
more, the secretary said.
Officials particularly want suggestions to help small businesses
provide savings opportunities for their employees. An estimated 25
million workers, mostly in businesses with fewer than 25 employees,
are not covered by pension plans of any kind other than Social
Security.
Many of those workers could be covered by plans if their
employers knew more about low-cost pension programs that are
available, Herman said.
It's nothing personal. It's just that the 1997 event at TMS is
the scene of Sprague's worst weekend in his four seasons racing the
trucks.
Sprague seemingly won the pole for last year's race, but was
caught with an illegal part in his engine during NASCAR's
post-qualifying inspection. He had to start from the back of the
pack.
He put on an incredible charge during the race, working his way
back to third, but the backup engine blew.
It was an extremely rare deal. It is the only time in 77 starts
that Sprague failed to finish a race.
He has seven victories on tracks of one mile or longer, the most
in series history.
