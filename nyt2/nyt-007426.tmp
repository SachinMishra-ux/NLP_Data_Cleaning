In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies.
The president will take along his own car, too - an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet,
along with a pair of sport utility vehicles used by the U.S. Secret
Service agents who protect the president. He will also take his own
private telephone company - banks of switching and transmission
gear must be transported and set up days ahead of time for each
stop he'll make - so that the president can talk with international
leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere around the world without
worrying that someone else might be listening.
Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized corporation.
In addition to hundreds of presidential assistants, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger will be along with key
members of their staffs in tow.
Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
It isn't yet clear how large the presidential entourage to China
will be, but some 800 people went along with him to Africa last
spring, in addition to 200 journalists and media technicians.
The China entourage is expected to be somewhat smaller - though
the press contingent will be twice as large as it was in Africa -
largely because many of the American corporations that sent
executives on the Africa trip have representative offices in China.
Secret Service protection is, of course, secret, though agents
sometimes take very public steps aimed at deterring would-be
assailants by showing the presence of a large and comprehensive
security effort.
When President Clinton visited the crime-ridden city of Cape
Town in South Africa last March, for instance, local security
agents, working hand-in-glove with the U.S. Secret Service,
canvassed the city welding shut manhole covers along possible
routes of the presidential motorcade, closing off a possible avenue
of attack and also sending out the message that a tight security
net had been cast across the seaside city.
Secret Service agents typically inspect the sites of
presidential visits weeks in advance, often using a video camera to
record every place and path on the presidential journey. Then they
scrutinize the tape to make sure that every building air duct, door
or hallway has been secured against possible assassins or bombers.
