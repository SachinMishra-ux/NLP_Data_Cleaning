The price tag, based on the project's first detailed cost
rundown, is considerably higher than the corps' earlier estimates
of $3 billion to $5 billion. As a comparison, $7 billion is the
state's annual Medicaid budget to provide medical care for 1.3
million people.
If Congress approves the plan, corps officials expect the
federal government to pay half the bill during the next 20 to 50
years. The rest would come from some undetermined mix of state,
county, municipal and regional sources, which could include
property taxes or surcharges on water bills.
Environmentalists still are studying whether the proposal would
do all they hope. They say the region's future depends on the
plan's central concept, an overhaul of the 1,600-mile-long drainage
network that the corps built after World War II.
Corps ecosystem restoration chief Stuart Appelbaum(cq) said the
proposal would provide the tools for helping both humans and
nature. His agency and others will try in coming weeks to make it
even better for the Everglades and waterways such as the St. Lucie
River.
Further changes would come during the next 20 years as the corps
and the South Florida Water Management District start building and
operating the project.
The proposal would rely on a vast network of reservoirs, storage
wells and marshes. That labyrinth would occupy 286 square miles equivalent to 8 1/2 Manhattans while storing enough water to fill
Pro Player Stadium more than 1,300 times.
The extra water would help feed the faucets, toilets, swimming
pools and lawn sprinklers of a 16-county region where the
population is expected to more than double to 12 million by the
year 2050.
Engineers say the water also would allow the reflooding of
parched stretches of the Everglades when the park needs it. The
storage capacity would provide a place to put unneeded water during
gluts, rather than dumping them into the Everglades or Lake
Okeechobee and wreaking havoc on wildlife.
But scientists at Everglades National Park and the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission said the plan still would leave
large areas of marsh with too much or too little water. Park
scientists said the proposal also would rely too little on natural
flow and too much on pumps, canals and floodgates, and would give
the most reliable water sources to cities and suburbs.
But water district biologist John Ogden said the plan would aid
a wide variety of wildlife. For instance, it would add months to
the nesting season for wood storks and other wading birds, whose
numbers have declined by 90 percent in recent decades.
