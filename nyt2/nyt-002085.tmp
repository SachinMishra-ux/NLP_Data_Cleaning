These trucks look different, make no mistake about that. But
they still look like General Motors full-size pickups; they're just
a bit rounder and have some updated trim, such as new headlights,
grilles and bumpers.
Unlike the Ram and F-150, the big differences aren't in style,
they're in substance. These trucks are stronger, faster, bigger,
roomier, and more high-tech than before and they outclass the
competition in all of those areas.
Take the back seat in the extended-cab models. It's a real seat,
with enough leg and knee room even for big folks. And the third
door, which comes on the passenger side, is larger than before (and
larger than those in the Dodge and Ford), which makes it easier to
get in and out.
The new GM pickups' V-8 engines are more powerful than the
competitions', too, with no penalty in fuel economy. In fact, gas
mileage exceeds that of the Ram and matches or exceeds that of the
F-150 in almost all cases.
Braking is vastly improved over the past C/K model and the
competition. The GM trucks stop 30 to 50 feet sooner than the
current models from 80 mph, thanks to large, four-wheel disc brakes
and a standard, four-wheel antilock system an exclusive feature
for this vehicle class.
The body is stronger than before, cutting down significantly on
squeaks and rattles, and providing better occupant protection. The
frame is 23 percent stiffer than that of the current model,
creating a strong foundation, and the frame is welded together,
rather than riveted, to add to that strength.
Reliability should be dramatically improved, too. The electrical
wiring, for instance, has five splices down from 92 in the
current model. Ford's F-150 has 118 wiring splices places where
something can go wrong.
There are some other great features about the new Chevy and GMC
trucks, too. They come with a coolant-loss protection system that
allows them to be driven up to 50 miles at 55 miles per hour with
no coolant in the radiator.
Battery rundown protection is built in: It shuts down the
electrical accessories if any are inadvertently left on after the
engine has been turned off.
Even the windows have been enlarged for greater visibility.
Brighter headlights and backup lights add to the visibility, and
the lights come on automatically when needed.
