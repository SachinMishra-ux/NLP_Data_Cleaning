That set off a blast of protest on Capitol Hill, aimed at the
FCC and in particular at the commission's chairman, William
Kennard. Kennard had already angered many members of Congress by
pushing for free air time for political candidates.
Relations between the commission and Congress have been testy
for years. The two institutions have been battling over the proper
implementation of the Telecommunications Act, which was meant to
deregulate many elements of the communications market.
The fight over the schools and libraries program has become
perhaps the commission's most important battle. The program enjoys
the favor of Vice President Al Gore, who has taken particular
interest in the Internet and other forms of advanced technology.
Opponents of the program contend that the FCC illegally exceeded
its authority when it established a quasi-independent corporation
to disburse money to libraries and schools. On Friday the
commission agreed to merge the schools and libraries corporation
into the organization that administers subsidies to limit phone
rates in rural areas.
Nowhere is the expansion more evident than at the Electronic
Entertainment Exposition, a trade show also known as E3 that
features all the newest and latest game gear. This year, as last,
it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta the
last weekend in May. About 40,000 people attended during its
four-day run.
The exhibit filled more than 35 football fields of space. If the
show is any indication, it looks like the coming year will bring
more of the same in computer games, an increase of the CD-like
disks called DVD that holds more than CDs, and more talking toys
that are built around computer chips.
My Interactive Pooh from Mattel is one of them. Pooh joins
Barney and Barbie on the talk circuit. He sings more than two dozen
songs and plays about a dozen games. By linking him to the
computer, Pooh can be programmed to say the child's name, and other
features can be customized.
Mattel is also expanding on its Barbie line with Barbie's Photo
Designer Digital Color Camera. The digital camera stores only six
photos at a time, which can be connected to a computer so they can
be saved for future use. Once in the computer, the child can use
the photos in other projects or with Barbie programs to make
postcards.
Mindscape will also expand on the National Geographic magazine
theme this fall when it publishes National Geographic Maps, a
four-CD collection of every fold-out map published in National
Geographic. The company will also join the trip-planning arena in
the fall with the release of National Geographic Trip Planner
Deluxe for planning trips in the U.S. and Canada.
Well-known learning software titles for children and young
adults from Davidson Associates won't be sold under the Davidson
name any more. The products, which include the JumpStart Learning
System, the Blaster Learning System and Fisher-Price titles, will
be sold under the Knowledge Adventure brand.
