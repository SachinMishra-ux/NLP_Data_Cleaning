ATLANTA For the fifth June in a row, in company of the sailing
half of our family, we are headed for a week's sail and crab-cake
tour of the Chesapeake Bay. En route to Baltimore we enjoy a
traditional Delta breakfast -- two small cookies and coffee.
After a night in Annapolis, we enjoy breakfast at Chick and
Ruth's, where the Pledge of Allegiance tradition still holds, along
with New York bagels, fat cheese omelets, and Philadelphia
scrapple. At 8:30 in the morning everyone in Chick and Ruth's is
commanded to stop eating, stand up, place right hand over heart,
and recite the Pledge. They've been doing that for nearly a half
century, and people spend the night in Annapolis so they can
participate. With the Naval Academy just across the way and history
all around, you feel a tingle of patriotism in Chick and Ruth's.
The weather is cool and breezy, a sailor's delight. In good
weather, sailing is no more complicated than flying a kite and
operating a hay baler at the same time. Our boat is 35 feet long
with a 40-foot mast. Two large pieces of cloth are attached to the
mast. Raised up and down, set this way or that, they either pull,
or push, the boat along. I haven't figured out which. This is the
way Columbus discovered America.
A sailboat has about two dozen ropes. You have to know the
ropes, as the saying goes. Sailing a boat is a pleasurable
experience as long as the weather is good and you don't get run
down by a freighter hauling televisions from Japan. When the
weather turns, there is some question about why people at the end
of the 20th century are spending their vacation traveling like
Christopher Columbus when perfectly good diesel engines are being
manufactured, even in Detroit.
We stroll past Camden Yards and think about hanging around to
see the Braves but decide to sail on and catch the Braves back in
Atlanta. Wise decision. Braves lose.
After a night in Rock Hill on the Eastern Shore, we begin an
all-day sail down the bay to Oxford. Senior members of the crew go
ashore for a night at the Robert Morris Inn, built sometime before
1710. James Michener, who stayed there when he was researching his
Chesapeake book, said the Robert Morris serves the best crab cakes
on the bay. We find no reason to dispute the famous writer.
Leaving Oxford, it is D-Day, the Sixth of June, anniversary of
the stormy allied channel crossing to the Normandy beaches, and to
quote Lewis Grizzard, I'm not feeling so good myself. We are
bobbing around in the Choptank River, which is not at all a river
like the Flint or Chattahoochee. It's more the size of the Indian
Ocean, and 25-knot winds are kicking up 4- and 5-foot waves,
according to small craft warnings on the weather radio. We are in a
very small craft.
A sailboat in rough weather doesn't ride on an even keel. One
side is up in the air, the other deep into the water. This causes
the helmsman to sit at an approximately 45-degree angle. The
company that comes up with Velcro seats in helmsmen's breeches will
make a fortune.
Thanks to expert seamanship by the captain, a.k.a. our downtown
son, we arrive safely in St. Michael's, famous for gourmet food and
an antique boat museum. Winds abate, and we welcome a good night's
sleep after a hazardous day at sea.
Sailboat sleeping is complicated. If you're planning a sailing
trip and have a choice of roommates, I suggest a midget or an
acrobat. Our bedroom in the bow is pie-shaped. Our feet come
together while our bodies sprout out in opposite directions. To get
into bed, you wiggle in, sort of like slipping your hand into a
glove.
