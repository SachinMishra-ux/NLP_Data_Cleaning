Although IBM declined to discuss pricing for the new chips,
industry analysts estimated that it might sell for $10 and replace
a cluster of components now costing as much as $100.
Further in the future may lie more speculative but potentially
vast markets for applications like collision-avoidance radar for
automobiles. Such systems, long considered impractical because of
cost, may be within the reach of inexpensive
silicon-germanium-based devices.
The components of the IBM chip that are based on germanium
involve analog technology meaning that they convert sound, light
or physical motion into electrical patterns analogous to the
original source. Analog chips are required in digital devices like
cellular phones to convert the human voice into an electronic
signal that a digital chip can translate into the binary-code data
of ones and zeroes used in modern communications networks.
IBM executives say that as many as 50 other companies are
pursuing similar technology, but industry analysts agree that IBM
has taken a clear lead in silicon germanium chips.
Until now, gallium arsenide has been the most promising material
for extremely high-speed computing and communications applications.
But semiconductors based on it have been expensive and difficult to
manufacture, confining its use mainly to high-performance computing
and limited consumer applications.
Initial versions of IBM's silicon germanium technology were
developed in the early 1980s by Bernard Meyerson and other
scientists at the company's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who were seeking a way to speed the
performance of mainframe computers.
By the early '90s, though, IBM had altered the technology course
of its mainframes, basing them instead on an inexpensive chip
process known as CMOS, for complementary metal oxide semiconductor.
So Meyerson and his team redirected their silicon germanium work
toward a new class of chips that would combine all the functions of
analog communications equipment and digital computers.
Researchers had long known that by adding tiny amounts of
germanium to silicon, it would be possible to achieve notable
increases in the speed at which transistors direct, or switch,
electrons through a chip's circuitry. Because of differences in the
sizes of silicon and germanium atoms, however, semiconductors made
from composites of the two materials typically failed.
Meyerson's solution was to find a relatively low-temperature
technique for creating a thin film of germanium that could be
successfully bonded to silicon.
