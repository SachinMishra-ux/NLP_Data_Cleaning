On his second anniversary at the church, when the Gay Pride
parade came by St. Mark, Cordle, his wife and several members of
the church passed out 50,000 donated leaflets about the church,
along with cups of water, to participants.
The next Sunday, about half a dozen curious gays and lesbians
came to services. They told others about their experience, and more
people came.
The church began structuring ministries to meet the needs of its
new members: AIDS-related services, the Genesis group for men
struggling with their sexual orientation, the Rainbow Sunday School
Class.
And gay and lesbian members began to become integrated into
other groups and classes, to volunteer throughout the church's
program, and to bring more friends.
A few of the older members left, but many more new members
joined. Some were young heterosexuals who wanted their children to
be part of a diverse community.
In March, the church took in its 1,000th member. Its annual
budget is more than $500,000 five times as much as when Cordle
became minister. The congregation has paid off all but $17,000 of
the $1 million cost of renovating the elegant old sanctuary.
Attendance averages more than 800 each Sunday in two services.
A few openly gay and lesbian candidates for the ministry have
found churches willing to defy popular practice. Some were ordained
before they discovered their homosexuality. But for most gay
would-be clergy, the position of the churches leaves several
choices hide their sexuality, accept a lifetime of celibacy,
transfer to the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches or another gay-friendly body, or wait for a change in
denominational policy.
Here is a look at four gay metro Atlantans, two who long for
ordination and two who have succeeded.
Sitting at a wrought-iron table in the courtyard of Trinity
Presbyterian Church on a sunny February day, Chris Glaser looked
dejected. Glaser, who is openly gay, had just watched the
Presbytery of Greater Atlanta vote down a proposal that would have
brought him closer to what he believes is his lifelong calling the Christian ministry.
He moved to Atlanta in May 1993, when his partner, Mark King,
took a job at AID Atlanta. The two joined Ormewood Park
Presbyterian Church and had their relationship blessed in a
ceremony performed by the church's former minister. They remain
active church members, but Glaser said he identifies himself less
strongly as a Presbyterian than in the past.
