Experts say climbers on Denali are often assaulted by some of
the coldest, windiest weather in the world due to the mountain's
height and proximity to the Arctic Circle. Only about half the
1,100 climbers authorized every year to tackle Denali actually
reach the top, the others falling victim to frostbite or altitude
sickness.
Both expeditions, sponsored by the Breast Cancer Fund, a San
Francisco nonprofit organization founded in 1992, were intended as
metaphors depicting the battle against breast cancer. Aconcagua
raised $1.6 million distributed by the fund to various research
and advocacy programs.
Knoble, a consultant who recently retired from her job as a vice
president for Pacific Telesis, is herself still climbing a medical
mountain. First diagnosed with the cancer in 1993, she had a
recurrence last year and underwent double mastectomies.
On Thursday, three Bay Area members of the expedition departed
for Alaska from San Francisco Sandy Badillo, a tennis pro in Half
Moon Bay who was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago; Cathy
Ann Taylor, a Sausalito mountaineer who has worked as a guide in
Nepal and Tibet; and Marcy Ely, a teacher and family counselor who
lives in Napa.
A mountain climber since she was a girl, the 50-year-old Ely
trained arduously for two years for McKinley. She won't be making
the actual climb, however. Last month she learned that the cancer,
first diagnosed in 1991, had returned and spread to her liver and
lymph gland.

NIKE Retailers have tried many strategies to sell athletic
apparel. Stores have been decorated to look like locker rooms.
Photos of famous football and basketball stars have lined their
walls. Sporting events have been shown on in-store televisions. But
in many cases, women have received short shrift, despite the fact
that they are taking to the field, the pool and the track in
growing numbers. Footwear giant Nike Inc. has taken a step toward
changing this with its new Nike Women's Shops stores within a
store dedicated to women's shoes and apparel that were launched in
Maryland in April. The nation's fifth shop and its first in Texas will formally open in the month-old Finish Line Inc. athletic
superstore in Barton Creek Square mall today. (Austin
