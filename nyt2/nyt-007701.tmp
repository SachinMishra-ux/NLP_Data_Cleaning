KOSOVO-REBELS (Junik, Serbia) War has a choreography that only
its participants understand. Fighters, locked in an embrace, feel
out the daily beat and rhythm until the set is shattered by a surge
of anarchic violence. Such a dance is underway in Kosovo, where
armed peasant farmers, joined by hundreds of rebels that have
picked up weapons and uniforms over the border in northern Albania,
face down some 50,000 government soldiers and special police. By
Chris Hedges.
CHINA-CLINTON-ASSESS As Clinton prepares for his summit in
China, the central foreign policy drama in Washington is the
increasing congressional furor over the administration's engagement
policy, in particular the sense that Clinton is damaging national
security in his eagerness to boost relations with Beijing. By
Steven Erlanger.
CENTENARIANS (Phoenix) Centenarians aren't what they used to
be. There are so many between 30,000 and 50,000, according to
demographers, up from the 1980 estimate of 15,000 that it's hard
to get a televised 100th birthday greeting from Willard Scott, who
mentions 12 every week on the Today Show. Every week about 90 new
centenarians are disappointed. Centenarians are the country's
fastest growing age group, with projections that by the middle of
the next century more than 600,000 Americans will be over 100. By
Sara Rimer.
CLINTON-STARR Five months after investigators began exploring
allegations of a relationship between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
the former White House intern's new lawyers appear to have returned
to the same standoff with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
that her previous lawyers confronted. Details of the negotiations
between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's legal team, which appeared Sunday
in the Washington Post and were confirmed by people with knowledge
of the investigation, suggest that the two sides are still far from
an agreement that would lead to her testimony. By David E. Sanger.
CONGRESS-SPEND A curtain-raiser on the appropriations process,
which is finally under way in both houses, with floor votes to
start soon. These are the only bills Congress must pass, so here's
a look at what's in them, what are the likely collisions, House vs.
Senate and Congress vs. White House. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
INFLATION-PRICES (Undated) While inflation over all is at its
lowest rate since the 1960s, prices have been rising rather
noticeably in recent months for a variety of everyday items from
fast-food hamburgers to auto maintenance and dental care. The
increases have been sharp enough not only to catch people's
attention but to provoke their annoyance. By Louis Uchitelle.
IBM-CHIPS (Undated) Without fanfare but with potentially
far-reaching significance for the semiconductor industry, IBM has
begun the industry's first large-scale production of a type of chip
that may reduce prices and improve performance and portability for
cellular phones and other wireless communications devices. By John
Markoff.
VH1-MEDIA (Undated) In the four years since John Sykes took
over, cable channel VH1 has found a formula that has significantly
increased its ratings and driven up profits. Indeed, VH1 has the
highest concentration of advertisers' most desirable viewers, those
aged 18 to 49. As a result, advertisers from American Express to
Lexus have added VH1 to their buying plans. By Bill Carter.
SMART-CARDS-SECURITY (Undated) For the last year, Paul Kocher
has kept big credit-card companies and banks on edge by sharing
details of his discovery of a way to break into the newest version
of smart cards credit-card size devices that contain a tiny
computer chip and can be used for a variety of purposes including
storing so-called digital cash. By Peter Wayner.
