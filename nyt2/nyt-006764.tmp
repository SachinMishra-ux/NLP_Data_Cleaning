 Nineteen states have adopted stricter time limits on welfare
than the five-year limit set by the 1996 federal law. But most of
these states make exceptions in some cases.
In Connecticut, the General Accounting Office found that 2,667
families had reached the 21-month time limit by December 1997. In
this group, 1,666 families lost welfare benefits, but the other
1,001 families, representing more than one-third of the total, got
extensions allowing them to continue receiving cash assistance.
More than half of the people removed from the rolls 972 of the
1,666 families did not request an extension. Almost all the
people who unsuccessfully sought a continuation of their welfare
benefits had earnings or other household income.
Set in 1920s Rotterdam, director Mike van Diem's debut feature
manages an adroit mixture of passion and repression, destiny and
character study. It's not exactly a lighthearted romp, and it
leaves a strong impression as well as a sense of a filmmaker with
something more on his mind than merchandise tie-ins.
The picture opens with a tense confrontation between an
emotional young man named Jacob Willem Katadreuffe (Fedja van Huet)
and a powerful older man, Dreverhaven (Jan Decleir). What's
immediately clear is that there's bad blood between them.
Cut to the police station. Dreverhaven, a heartless and
much-feared bailiff who prides himself on his lack of compassion
for the poor, has been murdered. Katadreuffe is the prime suspect.
We soon learn, via flashbacks framed by the police
interrogation, that there was more than bad blood between the two:
There was shared blood. Katadreuffe is Dreverhaven's illegitimate
son, the issue of a near-rape committed against his stone-faced
housekeeper, Joba (Betty Schuurman).
What ensues, for the most part, are Katadreuffe's bitter
memories of the relentless war waged between father and son. At
every turn, the son seems somehow thwarted by his father. Are these
cruelties meant to be character-revealing (of the father) or
character-building (for the son)? Perhaps a bit of both.
Van Diem somewhat overdoes the Oedipal sturm und drang that
colors their bitter conflict. However, so much happens so quickly
that you barely have time to worry about it. Van Huet is determined
and sympathetic as the abandoned son driven to distraction (and
murder?) by his formidable father's notions of tough love. Decleir
is equally forceful in a more one-dimensional role.
That's the way creator Chris Carter likes it. His movie is more
of the same. It's a chimeric beast, fusing Nixon-era conspiracy
paranoia with a millennial dread of biological warfare, domestic
terrorism and little green men from outer space. Oh, and there's a
sexy lead couple to keep our eyes soothed when the plot gets too
shaggy.
