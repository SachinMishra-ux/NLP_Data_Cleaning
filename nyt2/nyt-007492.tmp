ATLANTA -- For most computer users, the burning issue concerning
Microsoft's Windows 98 isn't the one grabbing the headlines the
antitrust questions it raises for the Justice Department.
Instead, home computer users are wondering whether they should
be lining up at dawn on Thursday to buy the latest version of
Windows when it officially hits the shelves.
Predictably, Microsoft bills the newest Windows as a much
improved version: faster, less likely to cause your computer to
crash or freeze, and loaded with dozens of new features to make
computing easier and more fun.
Almost as predictably, given the contrary nature of writers and
analysts, the majority of those folks see Windows 98 as a
relatively minor upgrade. It's been called a stopgap release
designed to provide bug fixes and updates that are already
available free for the downloading to Web-savvy users at
Microsoft's site (http://www.microsoft.com).
This is the last in the consumer-grade series of Windows. The
way things stand now, it's unlikely there will be a Windows 2000 or
2003. Microsoft plans to standardize something the company is
famous for already on Windows NT in upcoming releases. In the
future, there probably will be several versions of NT, Microsoft's
industrial strength version of Windows, which up to now has
been mostly aimed at businesses and power users.
I've been using the beta version of Windows 98 for several
months and installed an advance copy of the final commercial
version that will be sold in stores for $109. The recommendations
aren't as easy to make as when Windows 95 was introduced. That
program was a clear technical knockout winner when compared to
Windows 3.1, which it replaced.
So you'll have to decide. To better help you make up your mind,
let's take a look at some of the things that set Windows 98 apart.
Most people will be delighted to know that the familiar Windows
desktop hasn't changed much. In fact, unless you watch the Windows
98 startup screen, you'd be hard-pressed to tell at a glance
whether the program is Windows 95 or 98. While those who put a lot
of stock in the way a program looks may be disappointed, most
people will be glad to know that they won't have to relearn
Windows. Unlike the shift between 3.1 and Windows 95, you won't
need the skimpy user's manual to know how to launch programs and
use most Windows features.
This is Microsoft's biggest selling point this Windows is the
most stable yet. While even a few months of everyday use isn't
enough to make any definitive judgments about stability, it does
seem less likely to crash or freeze. The chief complaint of some
analysts that this is a minor upgrade may actually work in
Windows' favor here. Since it is not a radical redesign, there was
plenty of time to fix problems discovered in Windows 95 and not
enough changes to introduce many new ones.
Most experienced users know this, but novice computer users will
be relieved to know the installation process is automatic and does
not remove any of the programs or data used under Windows 95. I've
installed Windows on six separate machines and with one exception the installations were flawless. The one exception was a PC
connected to a local area network. Apparently, some of the
specialized network software caused problems and when the
computer was restarted it reported that some of the files needed
for the LAN were missing. However, reinstalling that software and
then reinstalling Windows 98 solved the problem. Expect to spend
about 45 minutes to an hour installing Windows 98.
