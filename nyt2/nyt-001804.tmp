Last week foreign ministers from NATO's 16 members decided to
upgrade a military exercise in Macedonia and launch one in Albania.
The goal is sensible: to warn off Serbia and bolster the stability
of two governments that have so far steered clear of Kosovo's war.
Yet even these modest reassurances pull NATO into dangerous
territory. Two countries that serve as bases for attacks on
Yugoslavia, albeit not deliberately, now have an implicit security
guarantee. To protect them, NATO may have to go beyond the
hand-holding measures it has planned so far.
Nor, lastly, should NATO police Albania's chaotic northeast,
where an outlaw mini-state run by adherents of the ex-president,
Sali Berisha, terrorizes the locals and succors Kosovo's
guerrillas.
A NATO operation should have one mission: to deter organized
aggression and, if necessary, repel it by force.
NATO's strategists suggest 23,000 troops would be needed along
the 140-kilometer (90-mile) border between Kosovo and Albania. That
is too many, especially if the force is not to be expected to
intercept arms and guerrillas. NATO needs only enough troops to
back up its deterrent role: it can watch borders from the air and
send extra troops in case of attack.
Even if this were to succeed, NATO would have other worries.
Albanians are not angels. While Serb police mop up separatist
settlements, the Kosovo Liberation Army has driven some Kosovo
Serbs out of their villages; in a province that is nine-tenths
Albanian, the guerrillas look the likelier ethnic cleansers.
If NATO guards the borders behind which they hide, the Serbs
will accuse it of sheltering terrorists. Western governments, which
have used that term to describe Kosovo's guerrillas, will be forced
to agree. That would be bad. But inaction would be worse.
Whatever NATO does, things can always get nastier in the
Balkans. If Serbia's crackdown became wholesale slaughter, it would
have to consider direct intervention in Kosovo. And the West would
face some more hard choices if Montenegro opted for independence
and Milosevic chose to send in his army.
NATO's next Balkan operation may not be its last. (To publish this excellent 750-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

sound like a few of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's favorite things, but
they all wear big grins in a new picture book written and published
