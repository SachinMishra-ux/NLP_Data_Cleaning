Then it's off to Dallas, where FBI agents Mulder (David
Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson) trade affectionate
wisecracks atop a Dallas office building. The X-file investigation
into alien activity is now officially closed (as if!), so they have
been newly assigned to antiterrorist vigilance.
They spot the bomb, but it goes off anyway, shearing off half of
a government building. That allusion to Oklahoma City could have
been the film's most shameless or daring aspect, but proves to be
neither.
The film avoids real political conspiracies in favor of a
pie-in-the-sky thesis that the building was destroyed to hide
evidence of alien activity, and that aliens have subverted the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
So a number of series fixtures (like the trio called the Lone
Gunmen) make minor appearances, while Martin Landau, Blythe Danner
and Armin Mueller-Stahl establish new characters. (Mueller-Stahl's
German mastermind, advocating the strangest of appeasement
policies, is the most intriguing of these.)
But the touch of X-iness that will matter most to both diehards
and neophytes is the film's promise of heightened conspiratorial
activity between Scully and Mulder. And here's where it does the
most mischievous teasing, since the story's big Antarctic spectacle
still seems warmer than the not-quite-love-affair.
The film contrives a fairly strangled declaration of fondness
from Mulder, a near-clinch and a wild idea of how to get a heroine
out of her clothes. This last episode, unfolding in a huge set that
resembles a giant carburetor, doesn't actually glimpse Scully in
the nude or goad Mulder into anything more daring than a Sir Walter
Raleigh imitation. But as on-the-job rescue efforts go, it does
qualify as a fetishist's delight.
Though both stars are sometimes eclipsed when the film strains
for action episodes, Duchovny sustains enough cool, deadpan
intellect and suppressed passion to give the story a center. Ms.
Anderson has the harsher, more restrictive role, but she plays it
with familiar hardboiled glamour.

UNDATED: If Hollywood's current fascination with menacing
meteorites has you hunkered down waiting for the big one to hit, we
have news for you: We're already being bombarded. Every day. By
billions of meteorite fragments tiny enough to be invisible to the
naked eye but numerous enough to add something like 910 metric tons
each year to the weight of the Earth.
Nearly all of the meteoritic matter that hits Earth is
microscopic in size. But it's only a matter of time, of course,
before something big say, the size of your average dining-room
table survives its fiery journey through Earth's atmosphere and
crashes into our planet.
