True, it's not yet the All-Star break. Injuries have just
started to have their say note the recent pains to important
Yankees Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter. There's too much baseball
left to be played.
A few tickets remain for the two-game set in New York after
officials decided to release a few thousand tickets on Friday.
Yankee Stadium, with a capacity of 57,545, is expected to sell out
before gametime. Scalpers in New York are getting more than $300
for box seats close to the field. At Turner Field, which seats
50,062, the Braves will sell 186 skyline seats and probably 3,000
or so $5 standing-room-only tickets. The skyline seats, which cost
$1 each, go on sale about three hours before gametime, and then the
SRO tickets will go on sale. The series will give the Yankees a big
attendance lift. The club has averaged 32,982 a game, but
attendance has dropped below 28,000 during Monday and Tuesday
games. The Braves average 38,088 for the season, but that number
drops to 34,649 for games on Wednesday and Thursday.
Both press boxes will be overflowing. New York will use its two
auxiliary boxes to accommodate more than 250 media requests.
Atlanta's main box will fill up with double- and triple-staffing by
the New York papers. There have been more than 150 requests, well
above the normal weekly average of 30.
That was ESPN Magazine's headline recently for an article about
the significance and excitement surrounding the four games. The
magazine matched the teams for a seven-game series and predicted
the Yankees would win in seven.
ATLANTA -- When the four-game series between the Braves and
Yankees ends Thursday night, baseball fans will have a better idea
of how these teams match up. But the AJC didn't want to wait that
long, so we asked Diamond Mind Baseball, a computer baseball game,
to handle the simulation.
Diamond Mind fed into its computers a detailed set of ratings
for batting, pitching, fielding and other baseball skills. The
company simulated every pitch, even factoring in pitcher fatigue
based on the number of pitches thrown. The game includes a computer
manager who made all tactical decisions.
While both teams have injuries New York's Bernie Williams is
out, for example the AJC elected to play the computer games with
the teams at full strength. The pitching matchups for each game
were projected last Monday, but have changed. The lineups are based
on the players the teams typically use against right- and
left-handed pitchers. Players were rated by current and past
performances, with emphasis on how they are playing now.
And the results? The Yankees won three of four games. Atlanta's
bullpen failed to keep leads in two of the games. Each team scored
25 runs, although the Braves outhit the Yankees for average, .295
to .252. For the series, Scott Brosius led the Yankees offensively,
going 5-for-15 with two homers. Andres Galarraga hit three homers
and drove in eight runs for the Braves.
The Yankees scored two runs in the first and kept that lead
until the eighth, when Ryan Klesko homered off reliever Mike
Stanton, a former Brave. The Braves then took a two-run lead in the
12th on a homer by Andres Galarraga. But New York got to Mark
Wohlers in the bottom of the inning and tied the score on an
infield single by Derek Jeter. Dennis Martinez replaced Wohlers and
walked in the winning run.
The Yankees scored early, extending Tom Glavine's first-inning
problems, but he shut down New York through eight innings. Atlanta
built an 8-2 lead with Danny Bautista's two-run double and
Galarraga's two-run homer. Yankees starter Andy Pettitte gave up
six runs. But the Braves bullpen made it interesting again,
allowing the Yankees to score three runs in the bottom of the ninth
against Kerry Ligtenberg.
