And now, when her husband should be here sharing the proudest
moment of his son's academic life -- reveling with Brian in the six
medals he won individually and with his Fairmont Private School
teammates in the Orange County Academic Pentathlon -- Rick was
instead lying in a hospice, dying.
And a 12-year-old boy wasn't able to share a joyful hug with the
father who led him down this academic road to victory.Instead, the
boy was up in his room venting his anger and hurt -- writing a
letter to tobacco manufacturers.
It took Brian five minutes, his mother says -- five minutes in
front of the computer in his room to bang out this letter to the
people he felt were responsible for killing his father: the tobacco
manufacturers.
Debbie sat by her husband's bed in the hospice a couple of
nights before he died, holding the letter her son had written to
the tobacco manufacturers. She wanted Rick to hear it.
Nobody but Rick could say for sure what was going through his
mind at that moment, but most fathers could imagine.
He was too upset and angry at himself to listen to his son's
letter. He was leaving behind a wife and a son he loved very much
because of a bad habit. How tragically stupid he had been.
Debbie held her husband's hand and told him it was OK. She
understood. She said Brian had decided not to go ahead and mail the
letter to tobacco manufacturers because they probably would just
throw it in the trash can anyway.
Brian had come up with a better plan. With his rabbi's blessing,
he was using the letter as his act of good deed for his bar mitzvah
next year -- using it to gather signatures for a anti-smoking
petition to send to tobacco manufacturers and politicians.
A 12-year-old boy going out and spreading the word to anyone who
will listen about how it is to lose a father you love very much to
a bad habit that kills.
