As Washington's U.N. ambassador, Richardson compiled what
diplomats have viewed as an impressive list of achievements,
including persuading the new leader of Congo, formerly Zaire, to
allow an investigation of human rights abuses and as a principal
advocate of a tough U.S. policy towards Iraq.
He recently has been criticized by some diplomats for failing to
perceive, during a visit to New Delhi, India's intentions to engage
in nuclear testing.
In May, Richardson became the first U.S. Cabinet official to
visit Afghanistan in more than two decades and obtained an
agreement from the warring factions to begin peace talks, and he
was Clinton's choice to try to ease the dying leader of Zaire,
Mobutu Sese Seko, out of office.
Richardson was regarded warmly at the United Nations, especially
among the diplomats of the developing world who are often ignored
by U.S. officials, for his backslapping, informal nature and his
political skills. He made much of his part-Hispanic background and
liked socializing with delegates.
NEW YORK Just when it looked as if the proposed merger between
the American Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market had won the
dissidents over, another critic has popped up. And this one is
bringing the specter of antitrust into the merger.
The vote on the deal by American Stock Exchange seat-holders,
scheduled for next Thursday, appeared to be in the bag earlier this
week. That was when Paul Liang, one of the exchange's largest
seat-holders and biggest critics of the deal, sold his 18 seats to
a big specialist firm, Spear, Leeds Kellogg. A vote of no by
Liang could have jeopardized the two-thirds majority needed to
approve the deal.
But on Thursday, a new critic of the combination emerged.
Patrick Healy, president of the Issuer Network in Chevy Chase, Md.,
a consulting firm that advises public companies on where they
should list their company's shares for trading, had supported the
merger initially. But he withdrew his support after Nasdaq
officials refused to address corporate discontent over the stock
market's decision to increase listing fees by an average of 56
percent in January.
He now worries that a combination of the two exchanges may lead,
down the road, to unfairly high fees for companies that list their
shares for trading on either the Nasdaq or the American Stock
Exchange. He has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to review
the merger with this anti-competitive issue in mind.
How much a company pays each year to list and trade its stock on
an exchange has become more of an issue as the United States' stock
and option exchanges consolidate.
In addition to the pending American Stock Exchange and Nasdaq
merger, just last week the American Stock Exchange and the
Philadelphia Option Exchange agreed in principle to merge. With
fewer listing alternatives available to companies, the opportunity
to jack up issuer prices increases.
