No. Risk can be reduced but not eliminated. A devaluation of
China's yuan, for instance, would cause further real harm to the
region's other economies. The Hong Kong dollar's peg would probably
give way, too, leading to another round of competitive devaluations
across the region.
With luck, China will continue to resist devaluation: the recent
fall in China's exports is mainly due to weak regional demand, not
an overvalued currency. But China may devalue anyway, and that
would be scary.
Another risk is the delicate state of western stock markets,
especially Wall Street. If more bad news from Asia causes equity
prices in the United States and Europe to slide, the scene would be
set for a slowdown spreading far beyond Asia. This remains the
likeliest channel of contagion.
America's exports to Japan account for a tiny 1 percent of its
GDP. All its exports to the whole of Asia amount to a relatively
modest 2.4 percent of GDP. Even if its sales to the region fell by
25 percent, this would reduce growth only by half a point.
This is why the slump in Asia has so far had little effect in
the United States. Also, the faster-than-expected recovery in
continental Europe this year is helping to fill the hole in world
demand.
Were it not for the problems in Asia, the Fed would almost
certainly have raised America's interest rates by now. Indeed,
there is growing evidence that the American economy is overheating
despite the chilly breeze from across the Pacific: consumer
spending continues to boom, unemployment is at a 30-year low of 4.3
percent, and inflation is starting to creep up.
Asia notwithstanding, America needs to raise its interest rates but to do so would hurt Asian debtors and, by drawing more
capital out of Asian markets, worsen the region's difficulties.
Japan needs looser monetary policy, America needs tighter. Moves
in either case would act to weaken the yen which is a risk, but
on balance one that is worth taking.
Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
