To be fair to Starr, hunting the Clintons is a soul-destroying
business. The president has used every legal trick available to
slow the prosecutor's progress. He has invoked executive privilege
to shield his staff from subpoenas; he has invoked attorney-client
privilege when that failed.
For the past year, the president has assured voters that scandal
investigations will not distract him from the task of government;
but this week (not for the first time) his lawyers claimed the
opposite, in order to persuade a court to keep the investigators at
bay.
All these frustrations are taking their toll on the prosecutor.
In the end, it is to be hoped, Starr may indeed get to the truth;
if the truth does not get to him first. (To publish this insightful 1,050-word article, it must be

NEW YORK William Abrahams, a Harvard-bred poet who tried his
hand at novels before finding a lasting literary niche as a
distinguished book editor credited with almost single-handedly
preserving the short story as a viable genre, died Tuesday at his
home in Hillsborough, Calif. He was 79 and had presided over the
annual O. Henry short story awards for more than three decades.
For Abrahams, a Boston-born lawyer's son who found his world in
words, the literary life was a quest, first to find the true turn
of his own talent and later to seek out, celebrate, nurture and
hone the talent of others.
It was a measure of his success that he had not only maintained
his own imprint since the 1970s, first with Holt, Rinehart and
Winston, and since 1984 with Dutton, but that he had managed to
work with authors like Joyce Carol Oates, Pauline Kael, Lillian
Hellman, John Knowles, Shirley Hazzard and Jessica Mitford from a
West Coast base far from the Boston-New York publishing axis.
By the time he found his way into editing in 1963, when a friend
got him a part-time job reading manuscripts for Atlantic Monthly
Press, Abrahams had learned a thing or two about the publishing
process.
Some of his early poems had appeared in literary magazines and
been included in anthologies, and he had published four
well-received novels.
Chosen on the basis of his work for Atlantic, Abrahams, who
began as an assistant to the previous editor, Richard Poirier,
became the sole editor of the O. Henry Awards in 1965. Until his
retirement in 1996, he was a powerful and often lonely champion of
the oft-derided genre.
Sure the short story had declined since the glory days of The
Saturday Evening Post and other defunct magazines, but Abrahams
found enough worthy work in literary journals and other little
magazines to make the annual O. Henry collections a recognized
treasure.
