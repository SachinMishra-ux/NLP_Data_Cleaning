PARIS Western governments have been unanimous in demanding
that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto initiate sweeping
reforms designed to rescue his country's critically sagging economy
before it drags down the rest of the world.
But the problem is that Hashimoto, like most of his
predecessors, lacks both the authority and prestige even to
contemplate such a task.
Hashimoto is, in reality, a minor personage, chosen as a
figurehead leader precisely because his political clout is all but
nonexistent.
That is how most post-World War II Tokyo governments have
operated: The real power brokers behind the scenes nominate straw
men to head the government because they're expendable and offer
little prospect of interfering with the authentic policymakers, who
have usually been potent and unassailable bureaucrats, invisible to
the public.
For most of the past half-century, the Liberal Democratic Party
has officially monopolized power. However, the LDP is itself
divided into numerous factions, warring against one another and
each allied to a different group of bureaucrats. Hashimoto is a
junior member of one of these factions. His status stems from his
ranking within the party and not from the fact that he is the
current prime minister.
American and other worried Western officials have agreed for
some time that Japan's pressing need is to stimulate domestic
demand for goods and services. Japanese consumers have zipped up
their wallets and aren't buying partly because of their lack of
confidence in their rulers, exacerbated now by the sinking yen.
But increasing consumer demand would mean lowering taxes and
relaxing monopoly conditions, which have kept prices and profit
margins much higher than in many other countries. But clamping down
on monopolies is strongly opposed by powerful bureaucrats in the
finance ministry, the ministry of industry and elsewhere.
Anderson, of course, comes off pretty no-nonsense herself. If it
weren't a part of her personality, she couldn't pull off that
special panache brainy, skeptical, stone-facedly self-controlled that makes FBI agent Dana Scully one of television's most
fascinating and groundbreaking characters.
