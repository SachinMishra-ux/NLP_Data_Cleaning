DETROIT This city's auto executives have a strong herd
instinct, imitating one another's most popular car designs and
living in the same neighborhoods, but they could not be more
different in their approaches to labor relations as this month's
strike against General Motors has shown.
Stuck in its 16th strike in the last five years, GM has publicly
lashed out this week at the United Automobile Workers. By contrast,
Ford has not had a strike in 12 years and its executives play golf
with UAW leaders. Chrysler's approach to labor relations lies
somewhere in between, with prolonged periods of calm interrupted by
occasional strikes that are usually settled behind closed doors
with little public acrimony.
Each strategy has its defenders, and there has been no sign that
any of the automakers plans to change course. GM contends that
because it produces fewer cars per worker than its rivals, it must
insist that the union allow more flexible work practices and a
steady decline in employment through attrition. GM executives have
vehemently criticized the union even as the company tries to end a
crippling strike at two parts factories in Flint, Mich.
The union contends that their members work hard and that GM has
broken promises to invest more money in the parts factories. The
walkouts have forced the closing of 21 of GM's 28 North American
assembly plants, including the shutdown Thursday of a
midsized-sedan factory in Oklahoma City and a minivan factory in
Doraville, Ga. GM has temporarily laid off 88,800 workers.
Ford sees its labor harmony as a competitive advantage, allowing
it to improve quality and transfer workers more easily from ailing
car factories to ones that make more lucrative pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles. Chrysler works with the union most of the
time but has sometimes tried to punish local union officials who
lead wildcat strikes or take other steps that could hurt
productivity.
Foreign automakers building cars and trucks in the United States
have kept unions out of their factories, with the exception of
their joint ventures with the Big Three.
The Big Three's contrasting approaches to labor relations start
with the people who run them. Ford has entrusted the task since
1982 to Peter Pestillo, one of Ford's four executive vice
presidents, who is a regular golf partner and close friend of
Stephen Yokich, the president of the UAW. Chrysler has Dennis
Pawley, one of its six executive vice presidents, a rare top auto
executive who worked his way up from the factory floor and a
well-known figure among union leaders as a result. Pestillo and
Pawley both have subordinates who manage the day-to-day
relationship with the union, but they stay in touch with union
leaders.
GM's labor relations have been managed for the last several
years by Gerald Knechtel, one of its 49 vice presidents and a
target of union criticism. Union officials complain that promises
are made by many levels of GM officials with little coordination
and that bitterness results when some of these promises are not
kept.
Union leaders also complain that GM executives ignore them
except during strikes. Basil Hargrove, the president of the
Canadian Auto Workers union, said that while Knechtel's predecessor
had come to Canada twice a year to meet with union officials,
Knechtel had showed up only during the union's 1996 strike against
GM, which lasted three weeks and shut down almost all GM production
in Canada.
Knechtel declined to comment, following his practice during
labor disputes. But Hackworth said that GM's frictions with the UAW
were the inevitable result of GM's need for changes and not the
result of the company's management style. GM produces more of its
own parts than Ford or Chrysler and so has higher overall labor
costs, he said. Outside suppliers of parts tend not to be unionized
and pay much lower wages.
