.506, plus-166 Drafted in second round 1998 TENDEX Draft List This list includes TENDEX ratings of players eligible for the 1998
draft.
Players should have plus-100 ratings to be considered draftable
and they should be at least plus-200 to be considered lottery
material. 
College players should progress in their ratings each season.
Example: Ball State's Bonzi Wells had a .656-plus 266 as junior.
This year as a senior, he improved to .725-plus 335, an improvement
of 60 points. He's rated No. 10 on the TENDEX list.
There are no TENDEX ratings for the four high school players
expected to be selected in the first round of the draft because
high school teams do not keep detailed statistics.
The drive to clean up campaign finance dismissed as hopeless
by many a Beltway expert got a shot of adrenaline last week.
First, the House broke free of the Republican leadership, conducted
its first spirited debate on reform and blocked two attempts to
derail the Shays-Meehan bill. No less dramatic, nine former leaders
of the American Civil Liberties Union repudiated the organization's
wrongheaded view that the bill is unconstitutional. The reformers'
ranks are growing. It is likelier than ever that the bill can pass
in the House.
The constitutional issue was at the center of the week's crucial
developments. The ACLU has warned that Shays-Meehan would violate
the Supreme Court's regrettable Buckley vs. Valeo decision. That
1976 ruling threw out the campaign spending limits imposed by the
post-Watergate campaign reform laws on free-speech grounds. By
equating spending with speech, the court has hobbled subsequent
efforts to clean up campaign finance. We have argued that neither
the Shays-Meehan ban on unlimited donations to political parties
nor its curbs of fund-raising for campaign ads run by independent
groups violate Buckley because they would curb fund-raising, not
spending. There have been limits on fund-raising since the ban on
corporate giving to candidates in 1907.
Most lawmakers with strong records in civil liberties agree that
Shays-Meehan is constitutional. But many Republicans, eager to
preserve Congress' current system of influence-peddling, have cited
the constitutional concerns as a cover. Independent groups like the
National Right to Life Committee, which would have to limit
fund-raising for its attack ads, also cite First Amendment
concerns. By speaking out, the former ACLU leaders have blown away
that smokescreen.
Given its history, of course, the Supreme Court could reject
some Shays-Meehan provisions. That is why it was important last
week to defeat a devious amendment advanced by opponents of the
bill. It would have nullified the entire bill if any part of it was
found to be unconstitutional. Thanks to a strong effort by Richard
Gephardt and David Bonior, the Democrats' leader and whip, almost
all Democrats voted no. They were joined by 65 Republicans.
Like the House's rejection of an attempt to substitute a study
commission for the real reforms of Shays-Meehan, the vote on Friday
demonstrated that dozens of Republicans are rebelling against House
Speaker Newt Gingrich's plan to position their party as the enemy
of clean campaigns. If these reform-minded Republicans now join
with the Democrats, Shays-Meehan will win. Opponents are running
out of tricks, and Gingrich henchmen like Rep. Tom DeLay are losing
their ability to intimidate GOP members. With a vote promised
before the August recess, this is a summer when lawmakers need to
hear from voters who want a Congress that is not on the take.
Benjamin, though, might very well be the surprise of the draft
with a .713 TENDEX rating, 373 points higher than the average
rating for a college shooting guard (.340). The past two college
guards to have ratings comparable to Benjamin's were Penny Hardaway
and Michael Jordan.
