BEER-MSKUBE Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical
7-ounce glass with no ornamentation. (Skube, Atlanta

FOOD-RECIPESWAP Frances Bowie recently e-mailed Recipe Swap
looking for the Mix-Easy Two Egg Cake recipe from the cookbook and
manual that came with her Dormeyer mixer in 1948. Luckily, there
were a handful of pack rats out there who pulled out their Dormeyer
mixer manuals from around the same time and found the recipe. And
readers Dorothy Barr and Ruth Eunice, both of Atlanta, reported
their mixers were still working. (Recipe follows.) (Walker, Atlanta

GETAWAY-TUSCUMBIA Country star Ronnie Milsap will headline the

YBORFLA TAMPA I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago
when Ybor was a crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night
neighborhood. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
YBORFLA-WALKINGTOUR TAMPA Carmen Morales, who grew up in
Ybor City, can bring the past back with anecdotes that make a
1-mile walking tour a lively excursion. A volunteer guide, she'll
tell you about her history, which is Ybor's history, too.

SEASIDE SEASIDE, Fla. This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years the first house was built in 1981 counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE SEASIDE, Fla. So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf
of Mexico would be the main attraction. No, indeed. Houses are what
draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT SUWANNEE, Fla. I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
