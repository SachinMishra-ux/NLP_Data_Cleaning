In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing maybe cutting the throats of the 10 percent Serb minority.
