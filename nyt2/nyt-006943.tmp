The conflict has already prompted a withdrawal of NBA stars,
including Payton and Baker, from the team that will represent the
U.S. at the World Championships in Athens in August.
If they don't return, among the options USA Basketball is
considering is suing the individual players for breach of contract.
If that won't get Payton double ornery, nothing will.
Hard to know where the lockout, as well as the other variables,
will leave the Sonics by November. But if it gets really bad,
Westphal still has his bedpan.
DENVER Bill Russell went to bed at 5:30 Thursday morning, but
to say he slept would be a stretch.
There was the delayed flight from San Diego on top of a losing
streak on top of injuries and the fact that everyone back in L.A.
seems to be yelling for his head.
Coors Field did not seem like the place to get away from it all.
But less than 24 hours after the most demoralizing loss of the
season, Russell's Dodgers were the happiest they had been in weeks
with a 5-0 victory over the Colorado Rockies in front of a crowd of
48,029.
Dave Mlicki recorded just the eighth shutout in the four-year
history of Coors Field and Eric Karros drove in all five runs,
including a three-run homer that nicked off the left-field foul
pole.
For the record, the Dodgers (35-36) ended a four-game losing
streak and stayed within 11{ games of the National League
West-leading San Diego Padres, who rallied Thursday to win their
10th straight.
But as the rap music blared in the post-game clubhouse, the
numbers didn't seem to matter. As Chan Ho Park danced from the
shower to his locker, Russell smiled. He didn't care that the
once-formidable Rockies are a pitiful 11-21 at home. He has enough
to think about.
