The problem loans, which have swelled to more than $600 billion more than the size of the entire Chinese economy have been a
drag on the economy for years but now the government seems
increasingly determined to clean up the mess over the next three
years.
Some foreign investors are wary of new promises from the
government because they have been let down so many times. But other
analysts and economists say that while enormous uncertainties
remain, there are signs that the government may finally be ready to
implement the Total Plan, as it is being called here.
The changes would take time but they could result in a sounder
banking sector, a more vibrant real estate market and a healthier
economy overall.
But Yoshitomi argues that up until now, only the politicians
have broken from the pack to tackle the bad debt while the
regulators and the banks themselves have shown enormous reluctance.
The Total Plan is being hammered out by 34 high-level Liberal
Democrat politicians and bureaucrats, who will convene a major
session next Tuesday to review a draft. The chairman is Okiharu
Yasuoka, a Liberal Democrat member of the lower house.
The plan has been through many versions and is still changing,
and about $17 billion has been set aside for it in the government's
$123 billion stimulus package. As described by government
officials, economists and bankers, the Total Plan focuses on the
bad loans and on the properties Japanese banks are stuck with
because they were the collateral for the loans.
In the past banks have often set aside reserves for questionable
loans but they generally have not sold those properties or
liquidated the bad loans. One result has been a huge drag on the
property market and a continuing burden on the banks.
The Total Plan calls for measures to encourage the banks to sell
the properties and remove both the loans and the collateral from
their books. This may be a wrenching process, for the sale of so
much real estate could drive property prices lower, and the
obligation to face up to the problems could force weak banks out of
business. This could be another blow to confidence in the Japanese
economy.
But supporters say that the plan at least offers a way out of
the mess, even if it is a risky and laborious passage.
This would be the clearest break from the current system in
which all banks, strong and weak, are pulled along together by the
government.
