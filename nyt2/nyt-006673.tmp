If devotees of the television series come to the film with
enough baggage for a six-week safari, perhaps they can deepen the
experience of watching a middling, unfocused action-adventure with
brand-name appeal.
But there's a catch: this film isn't tailor-made for true
X-fanatics, because the material has been so broadened to
accommodate the uninitiated. Trust no one who dreams up an action
sequence in Antarctica for the big screen.
The movie teasingly offers the prospect of big developments in
the television X-plot, but all it really does is create a vague
omnibus format for future movie spinoffs.
Meanwhile, the movie may raise more questions than it meant to
when it offers glimpses of alien troublemakers. Reaching for
run-of-the-mill grisly horror, it winds up attributing
sophisticated global-domination plans to vicious, long-clawed
spacelings who are more prone to screams than schemes.
Without making much connection with the end-of-season television
cliffhanger, the film starts off in Ice Age Texas, where aliens
lurk in wait for Early Man. Thirty-seven thousand years later,
Texas has heated up, but the aliens' modus operandi hasn't much
changed.
A nicely diabolical early scene shows a little boy savaged by
the invasive virus nicknamed the black oil. Typically, as it works
to cover too many bases, the film mentions the virus again but
never follows through on one of its best special-effects tricks.
