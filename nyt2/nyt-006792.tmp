Texas Instruments in turn becomes Micron Technology's largest
shareholder, with about 12 percent of the company. Texas
Instruments will hold more than 16 percent if it exercises its
right to convert most of its loan into more shares.
Micron Technology also reported Thursday a third-quarter loss
that was bigger than expected. The company, which is based in
Boise, Idaho, posted a loss of $106.1 million, compared with
earnings of $96.8 million in the quarter a year earlier.
ARLINGTON, Texas Todd Van Poppel returned to the major leagues
yesterday, older than the first time and more prepared to pitch to
big-league hitters.
Van Poppel, the onetime phenom from Martin High School in
Arlington who made it to the majors with the Oakland Athletics as a
19-year-old, joined the Rangers from Triple-A Oklahoma. His
contract will be officially purchased before he starts tomorrow
night against the Angels in Anaheim.
Van Poppel likely has two chances to fill the spot on a
long-term basis. His second start will probably be Thursday in
Arizona, and Darren Oliver is due back from a stint on the disabled
list the next day. The Rangers would face a decision on whether Van
Poppel or Matt Perisho, Oliver's replacement, sticks in the
rotation.
If the Rangers decide Van Poppel isn't the answer in the
rotation, they will consider keeping him in the bullpen, and not
only because he is out of options and can't be sent back to the
minors without clearing waivers.
Van Poppel was 5-5 with a 3.72 earned-run average at Oklahoma,
and 3-0 with a 2.57 ERA in his past four starts.
Van Poppel was a first-round draft pick of the A's in 1990 after
a stellar career at Martin High. He made it to the majors in
September '91, and struck out five of the first six big-league
batters he faced.
But after 3 1/2 years in the majors, including stints with four
organizations and with a 20-33 record and 6.22 ERA, he was released
by the Kansas City Royals.
The Rangers signed him to a minor-league deal in June 1997, and
sent him to Class A to start again.
