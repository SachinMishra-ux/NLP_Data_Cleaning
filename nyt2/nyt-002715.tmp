 A few weeks ago, Charles Schwab Co. in San Francisco became
the first U.S. brokerage to create an Internet trading site in a
foreign language Chinese at www.schwab.com/chinese.
In the past, ethnic groups often were ignored by financial goods
and services companies because marketers focused on the general
market, said Kris Reed, vice president of Claritas' financial
services group.
Little information also was available about the purchasing
behavior of immigrants or low-income consumers, which often comes
from credit reports, she said.
A few companies, like Banco Popular and Freedom Inc., are
targeting immigrant and low-income consumers at the other end of
the spectrum who haven't yet established credit histories.
There can be a downside to these efforts, however. Banco Popular
may be trying to help Latinos establish credit, but it's also
offering discounts on money transfers from Western Union and
prescriptions from Kmart.
By offering such discounts, Banco Popular is tacitly sending a
message to Latino consumers that it's OK to pay for prescriptions
out-of-pocket instead of getting health insurance.
It's also encouraging the continued use of agencies like Western
Union, which provide expensive check cashing services and money
transfers.
The secured Freedom Card carries an interest rate of 12.5
percent to 18.5 percent. The unsecured Freedom Card has a 90-day
introductory interest rate of zero, which rises to between 15.5
percent and 18.5 percent. Both charge a $35 annual fee.
Cecilia Liu, director of Asian markets for John Hancock, said
it's important for companies to speak directly to ethnic markets by
providing materials in their native language and being culturally
sensitive to their needs.
The only way consumers can protect themselves is to become
educated about financial goods and services and make the effort to
shop around for products before they make a purchase, said Li of
Consumer Action.
