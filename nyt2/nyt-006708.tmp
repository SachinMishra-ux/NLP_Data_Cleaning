On Thursday, discussions dealt with such issues as how a
computer system will track gas sales, and the amount of information
marketing companies will get from Atlanta Gas Light Co. on
potential customers.
AGL has also aked for an $18.6 million rate increase, in part
to pay for the transition to competition. But the PSC staff is
expected to recommend a $30 million rate cut.
The commission and several marketing companies, however,
expressed concern Thursday that Atlanta Gas Light and its marketing
affiliate may have jumped the gun on the deregulation process.
At issue are about 500 letters sent by Atlanta Gas Light
Services, AGL's marketing affiliate, to prospective business
customers seeking authorization to access their accounts at the gas
company to help prepare sales proposals.
But Bobby Baker, chairman of the PSC, said the mailing appeared
premature and said all marketing companies should be granted equal
access to consumer information.
The PSC staff is expected to make a recommendation soon on
whether Atlanta Gas Light Services can proceed using the AGL name.
Jim Hurt, the state's consumer utility counsel, has recommended the
name be approved.
In another last-minute flareup, Atlanta Gas Light Co. and SCANA
are facing off at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the
federal agency that regulates interstate gas sales, over gas
supplies for the Georgia market.
Mark D. Caudill, vice president/rates and regulatory affairs at
AGL Resources Inc., the gas company's parent, said the company is
seeking authorization from FERC to pass along to consumers the
benefits of discounted rates for gas from an interstate pipeline.
But, he said, SCANA filed a protest that has delayed a decision
in an apparent bid for competitive advantage.
ATLANTA -- Credit card processor Nova Corp. agreed to acquire
Nashville-based rival PMT Services in a stock swap valued at about
$1.23 billion, based on Thursday's closing price of $33.93 3/4 for
Nova's shares, which fell $1.25.
