Sloatsburgers are willing to have change and growth to a
point, said Becky Kern, a leader of the Little Town Forum for the
Historic Preservation of Sloatsburg, a group formed to resist
Abate.
This view puts Mrs. Kern and her allies squarely in the
mainstream of a national reaction against high-density row house
developments like the one K. Hovnanian Enterprises, the biggest
town house developer in the country, hopes to build in Sloatsburg.
It is an opposition that seems a far cry from an early
acceptance of suburban town houses, when they first began appearing
in large numbers in the 1970s, as sensible, affordable and because they reduced sprawl environmentally friendly starter
homes for young couples, or as step-down homes for empty-nesters.
But as the number of town houses has increased, complaints have
grown that town houses clog roads, send more children into local
schools than had been promised, depress the value of single-family
houses and too frequently become rental units.
Consider: The Supervisors of Prince William County, Md.,
concerned about rapid growth, approved a zoning plan this spring
that reduces the number of future town houses that may be built by
10,000 units, or 40 percent. It did so by creating a zone excluding
town houses in the county's western reaches. Prince George's County
has already passed a law banning town houses in certain areas where
schools are overcrowded.
Two years ago, Brian Sheerin won a seat on the town board in the
suburban Pittsburgh town of Ben Avon on the strength of a
last-minute write-in vote from neighbors opposed to a small,
15-unit town house project on Dickson Avenue.
And in an early example that could have come from nearly
anywhere, the City Council of San Leandro, Calif., rejected a
36-unit row-house project in the northern part of town in 1992
despite a consensus from environmentalists that by filling vacant
space in a built-up area, the project was environmentally sensible.
At one site, K. Hovnanian Enterprises has already filed plans
for a 340-unit town house project on a tract that had been
intended for 66 single-family houses and it is holding out a
sweetener to the town: a sewage treatment plant that would handle
both the new housing and most of the Route 17 business district.
And after 18 years in office, Abate has learned how to make
things go his way. Over fierce opposition, he merged the police
forces of his village and the town of Ramapo and sold the village's
water supply system to a private water company. When asked what
would happen to Sloatsburg if he failed to get his way on the
floating zone, Abate was polite but firm.
Sloatsburg's single-family homes are cradled along the Route 17
corridor just north of the New Jersey line in Rockland County, and
in little valleys and hillsides in the Ramapo Mountains, which form
the village's western wall. A fair number of young families have
moved there from New Jersey and Westchester to find inexpensive
homes, average price still only $148,000, in an atmosphere that has
more of Vermont than a downstate New York commuter town, barely an
hour from Manhattan on the Short Line bus.
