Byrd was laid out in a black funeral home, eulogized in a black
church, and buried in the back part of the town cemetery, where
blacks have always been buried, out of view.
White supremacy may be marginalized, but it is still menacing.
The sheriff's claim that there are no Ku Klux Klansmen in Jasper
appears to be false. A local Klan leader insists that his group has
a strong presence there.
And already the town is bracing itself for a Klan march on June
27, with its potential for a bloody showdown between white bigots
and Black Panther hotheads.
The murder has also shed light on the fact that state prisons in
Texas and across the South have become purveyors of white
supremacy, recruiting susceptible men into violent gangs such as
the Aryan Brotherhood.
And what of Jasper? This is a community of mutual respect, but
it is still distinctly divided at all the levels that matter in
ordinary life.
What the boys on the basketball court cared about was not
whether white kids came and played ball with them. They cared about
good jobs, fair treatment and about the fact that Dennis Rodman,
the bad-boy star of the Chicago Bulls, had elected to pay for
Byrd's funeral. It sounded awfully like separate but equal. (To publish this compelling 1,025-word article, it must be

JERICHO Whether or not the Israelis do what they are supposed
to do under the Oslo agreements, they continue to prepare for a
final settlement with the Palestinians.
Some 35,000 Palestinians live or work on the West Bank side of
the Jordan Valley. Covering an area of 700,000 dunums (175,000
hectares), the valley is one of the West Bank's most fertile
regions, containing 60 percent of the Palestinians' horticultural
land.
After the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the
Palestinians hoped they might be able to add to the developed area.
But the restrictions and confiscations continue.
Jawad Salah cites the case of an agricultural research station
in the valley, which helped farmers with crop research and
technology; Israel has refused to transfer the station to the
Palestinian Authority by declaring its 300 dunums to be one of
those closed security zones.
