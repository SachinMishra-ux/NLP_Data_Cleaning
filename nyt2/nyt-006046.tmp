WASHINGTON Facing intense bipartisan criticism on Capitol
Hill, William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, offered Wednesday to scale back a plan to connect
schools and libraries to the Internet and said his agency would
make a final decision by Friday.
Appearing before the Senate communications subcommittee
considering his agency's budget, Kennard proposed stretching the
initial spending on the project to cover 18 months, instead of the
planned 12 months.
Roughly 30,000 schools and libraries across the nation have
applied for a total of $2 billion under the program. About $625
million has been collected this year, most of it from big
long-distance phone companies. The commission and lawmakers are
concerned that financing all the applications from schools and
libraries could lead to higher long-distance rates. Opponents of
the program want to limit spending to the $625 million already
raised.
People familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the
commission said that Kennard had started circulating a proposal to
give the program a maximum of $2.3 billion over 18 months, or about
$1.53 billion in 1998. Kennard was also weighing a plan to limit
the program to as little as $1.35 billion in 1998.
Senators at the hearing said the program as wasteful and
ill-suited to connecting students to cyberspace.
The program, which emerged from the Telecommunications Act of
1996, was originally limited by the commission to an annual budget
of $2.25 billion.
It has been clear since the winter that the program would not
receive the full amount. But until Wednesday, the commissioner had
not publicly discussed altering the timetable for distributing the
funds.
Powerful members of Congress, however, want to go much farther
to rein in the program. The chairmen and ranking minority members
of both the House and Senate commerce committees, which oversee the
FCC, said in a letter last week that the commission should suspend
the collection of money for the program.
Critics contend that the FCC exceeded its authority in
establishing a quasi-independent corporation to run the program and
say the commission ought to focus more closely on protecting the
subsidies that keep down phone rates in rural areas.
The letter was sent by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who is the
chairman of the House Commerce Committee; Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who is the ranking minority member on the committee; Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the ranking minority
member on the committee.
