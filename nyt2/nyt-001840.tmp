That all but assured Hampton (7-3) would have to face Vaughn,
one of the hottest hitters in the majors, with a runner in scoring
position. Vaughn's homer was his third in the series and his fifth
against the Astros in six games.
Hampton retired eight batters in a row after Vaughn's homer and
faced 13 batters before he allowed another hit. Veras broke through
with a single in the fifth to score Andy Sheets, who had drawn a
leadoff walk. The Padres added two runs in the seventh on a squeeze
bunt by Ashby (7-4) and a sacrifice fly by Veras.
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle ELMONT, N.Y. The nagging question Thursday no pun intended was this: If Real Quiet is in a class of his own, why are a dozen
colts so eager to challenge him in the Belmont Stakes?
The ultimate matchup, of course, was assured once this dark bay
emerged from the bargain basement to win the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. The bigger race is Real Quiet against the years, and
against the world.
When Affirmed held off Alydar to win the Triple Crown 20 years
ago, the last time it was done, only four colts bothered to run
against them in the Belmont. The size of Saturday's field speaks to
the history of this event and the delayed judgment on Real Quiet.
Arrayed against the Bob Baffert entry is Victory Gallop, the
best of the dirty dozen, and an outbreak of human nature. Of the 11
horses who made the sweep, six led from wire to wire, and their
names have the sound of trumpets. Secretariat and Count Fleet ran
virtually alone. The others who won from start to finish were War
Admiral, Seattle Slew and Affirmed.
This is a schizoid time for racing fans, who crave another
Triple Crown winner to uplift the sport, but worry the newest
contender might be unworthy of such elite company. The naysayers
rate Real Quiet as a good horse, getting better, in a less than
vintage year.
But the Belmont is often a cure for skepticism. This is where
champions come to get their tickets punched, and their names
immortalized. As Baffert points out, it isn't Real Quiet's fault so
many promising rivals met with misfortune, like characters in a
script by Agatha Christie.
The Belmont has a mystique all its own. To begin with, the
racetrack is an hour by train from the sidewalks of New York, which
means that if you can make it here you can make it anywhere. The
Long Island area drips with history. The nearby Roosevelt Field,
now a shopping center, is built on property that once included the
300-foot, dirt runway used by Amelia Earhart. She is referred to
locally as the last woman to leave Roosevelt Field without buying
anything.
Primarily, it is the unsparing physical demands of the Belmont
that offers Real Quiet his passport to greatness. At a mile and
half, the race is a throwback to another America, when the Pony
Express delivered the mail and the premium was on endurance, not
speed. You might conclude the postal priorities haven't changed
much, but this is certain: horses that win the Belmont are not
forgotten.
