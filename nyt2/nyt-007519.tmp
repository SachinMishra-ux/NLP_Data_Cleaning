On occasion, the Rev. Jack Spaulding of St. Thomas the Apostle
Church in Phoenix has delivered messages during prayer services in
a monotone voice, in the first person, as if Jesus or Mary were
speaking directly through him.
I confess, I didn't ask him. A man can't escape a boyhood spent
in parochial school, where he leaned the hard way not to be
flip with priests or nuns.
He also learned, however, that people make a church, not build
ings. And the nuns at St. Thomas are being forced out of their
convent for no good, and certainly no holy reason.
The church sits like a birthday cake at 24th Street and
Campbell, a monument to spiritual chic since Charlie Keating poured
$50,000 into the place to spruce it up for a family wedding.
Benedictine sisters began teach ing at the parish school 45
years ago. That's why the convent was built. Over the years, the
church and the school changed. There's only one Benedictine
teaching in the school, now. The convent houses 12 nuns, four of
them Benedictines and the rest from other orders. `CHOSE CONVENT LIFE' 
According to Ella Mae Bleier, a member of the parish council,
the growing church needs room to expand.
Plans originally had called for temporary buildings to be
installed for use next year by the school. In May, however, Father
Spaulding informed the nuns of a new idea. A house was available
for sale across the street and it was big enough, he said, to
accommodate the four Benedictine sisters. The convent would then be
converted to church use.
Since the other nuns aren't part of the order that first taught
at the school, parish officials say they have no obligation to
accommodate them.
Still, the pastor promised to help the other sisters. In the
meantime, the Benedictines decided not to live in the new house.
They also said no to having an upstairs portion of the parish
offices renovated specially for them. They did so partly because
the facilities didn't meet their needs and partly as a show of
solidarity.
In some Catholic dioceses, nuns being displaced are given a year
to make arrangements. Phoenix doesn't have such a policy, although
I'm told one is now being considered.
