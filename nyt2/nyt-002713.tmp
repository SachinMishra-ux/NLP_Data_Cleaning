The Florida-based firm will introduce a Spanish-language version
of its Web site, which provides news and free rate information
about mortgages, home equity loans, auto loans, credit cards and
savings and checking accounts.
As the only Web site that will provide extensive personal
finance information in Spanish, Bank Rate Monitor in Espanol hopes
to tap into the growing market of Spanish-speakers in the United
States as well as consumers in Latin America.
 Bank Rate Monitor in Espanol will be accessible only through
the company's main Web site at www.bankrate.com, probably by this
week. It will eventually have its own Internet address at
www.bankrate.com/esp.
Plasencia said the odds for success are good. The U.S. Hispanic
market is the fifth-largest Spanish-speaking market in the world,
with $273 billion in annual purchasing power, according to Strategy
Research Corp. in Coral Gables, Fla.
A recent study by Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., also
shows that middle- and lower-income Latinos are more likely than
whites to buy PCs.
For example, almost 32 percent of Hispanics with annual
household income under $35,000, 58 percent of Hispanics with annual
household income between $35,000 and $49,000, and 77 percent of
Hispanics with annual household income of $50,000 or more owned
computers, the study found.
By comparison, the study noted that 25.5 percent of whites with
annual household income under $35,000, 47.5 percent of whites with
annual household income between $35,000 and $49,000, and 74.6
percent of whites with annual household income of $50,000 or more
owned computers.
In addition, computers and the Internet have opened the door to
Latin American consumers, many of whom own homes or businesses in
the United States, or want to keep some of their money in U.S.
banks for security reasons, said Plasencia.
 The Spanish-language site will provide a direct translation of
about two-thirds of the 1,600 pages of information on Bank Rate
Monitor's main site, said Plasencia.
Bank Rate Monitor intends to launch a broader Web site in
November that Plasencia hopes will become the America Online for
the Spanish-language market.
