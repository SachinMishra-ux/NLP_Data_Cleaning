That's not all. He compared what they say (begin itals) now (end
itals) to what they said (begin itals) then, (end itals), in the
heady days when Mt. Monica erupted and the scandal-mongers among
the media pack went berserk. Is there a more apt term for the media
meltdown dissected so pitilessly by Brill?
And an ugly picture it is. From the malevolent Lucianne
Goldberg, book agent to the duplicitous Linda Tripp, betrayer of
Monica's crush and confidences, to the incredibly-plugged-in
Michael Isikoff of Newsweek.
The early line on Brill's 30,000-word autopsy of this D.C.
dustup was that Kenneth Starr, right-wing tobacco lawyer, impaled
himself again with his admission that he and his agents have
routinely leaked secret stuff to reporters in the scandal circuit.
But having read the first two-thirds of Brill's rehash (the rest
was lost in faxland, alas), I'd suggest the far more damaging stuff
is what comes out of the mouths of the players the Clinton-haters
like Goldberg and Tripp, their lawyers, agents, and handmaidens in
the prosecutorial corps, and the journalists themselves.
Newsweek, for decades a smouldering second fiddle to Time
magazine, made a commitment at the corporate level to play up the
scandal. Isikoff and Howard Fineman, a Newsweek political writer,
wangled themselves lucrative cash deals with television networks
who saw, in an age of deconstructing viewership, a way to slash
their way back to profitability. Just when the O.J. trial left the
cable network news people sucking wind, Monica pops up to do for
kneepads and dry cleaners what O.J. did for bloody gloves and Bruno
Magli shoes.
The question for Newsweek editors is: Was Isikoff ahead on this
story because he was part of the Get-Clinton conspiracy? Do
Newsweek's superiors countenance this kind of hanky-panky? Isikoff
was meeting regularly with Goldberg and Tripp, he was colluding
with prosecutor Starr on just how to time disclosures to exert
maximum pressure on witnesses Starr was trying to rubber-hose into
betraying Clinton. It smells like an Arkansas hog farm.
Where were the Newsweek editors? Why didn't some bosses at ABC
and NBC rein in their heavy-breathing, impeachment-predicting
yarn-spinners? Why did the once-proud Big 3 network news divisions
plunge so readily in the sheepdip? Are the cable news networks so
shabby that they'll hype their ratings so crudely? Yes! in the case
of CNBC, MSNBC, and Fox, at least. They lured viewers with
half-baked fantasies about oral sex in the Oval Office. What
happened to the standards? (begin itals) What standards? (end
itals) TV journalism no longer has any standards, networks
included. And Newsweek has a lot of explaining to do.
For readers who have long suspected that many media
personalities were hyping the various Clinton scandals for less
than pure reasons, Brill's article is a goldmine. Read it and weep
for the shoddy business that so much of Washington's celebrity
journalism has become.

WOODWARD-IMPACT (Boston) -- When the first reports appeared
about Matthew Eappen's death, the case against Louise Woodward was
similar to OJ Simpson's: It captivated two nations; exposed sharp
divides issues such as working mothers, child care and the flawed
judicial system; and it had enough real-life high drama to eclipse
most soap operas. By Peter Canellos (2 takes)
