Baden, 63, said the word that best encapsulates him in both his
job and his life is more descriptive than defining: interloper.
Because Baden is often called by the defense, some police
officers and prosecutors have tagged another label on him: Whore.
If you have Baden's fee of $2,500 a day plus expenses, you have
yourself a witness.
Baden, who testifies primarily for the prosecution in New York
state, said people don't know of the many cases in which he is
retained but not called to testify by the defense because his
conclusions don't help a client. But that doesn't stop the enmity
of police who view him as undermining their brethren elsewhere.
Born in the Bronx in 1934, Baden was what was then commonly
called a hellion one wild child.
There is a wildness to Baden that lingers today, from his
longish, hair to his shirttail that struggles to free itself to a
fondness for sloppy-but-casual attire. A hulking figure, he first
appears to be a younger man worn down too quickly, until you learn
his age. Then his dominant feature emerges a boundless energy
that has co-workers scrambling to ensure Baden is not scheduling
himself to be three places at once.
By the time Baden was released from reform school at age 9, the
family had moved to the Fort Green housing projects in Brooklyn,
where his dad worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Baden said he and
his brother were the only Jews in the complex.
Prompted by a mother who, reform school or not, envisioned her
son a doctor, Baden went on to City College, and then New York
University School of Medicine, before serving as an intern, then
resident at Bellevue Hospital.
Tucked in Bellevue was the New York City Medical Examiner's
Office. Baden was drawn there not just because of its proximity,
but also out of a desire to learn the human body from the inside
out.
From 1961-86, Baden worked in the New York City Medical
Examiner's Office, serving as chief medical examiner from 1978 to
1979 before a rift resulted in his demotion by Mayor Ed Koch.
Baden took a lot of heat from the State Police and elsewhere for
his testimony for the defense in the Simpson case. Baden's theory
is there was more than one assailant and the attack took more than
10 minutes, damaging prosecution claims.
