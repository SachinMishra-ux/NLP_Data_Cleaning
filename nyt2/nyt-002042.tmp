Video cameras roll, throwaway and sturdy Nikon cameras point
from one side to the other side of our open-air vehicle, here
called a lollie. Our guide and driver Clifford speaks in a clipped
African accent like the click, click, click of the cameras.
We are driving through the Harambe Wildlife Preserve. It's hot.
Desert hot. Perfect for a jungle safari. Clifford pushes the
accelerator of Simba One to the floor so that we can get through a
deep murky river that has spilled over from the waterfall in the
distance and out onto the road. We and the other 32 passengers
bounce up and down over rocky terrain. Every once in a while drum
and mbira a little figure piano play over small speakers
installed on the ceiling of the open-air vehicle. This occurs when
a mammoth giraffe appears off in the distance.
It isn't by chance, this perfect orchestration of sight and
sound. And although it is delivering the excitement of an African
adventure, we are actually on a Kilimanjaro Safari in Disney
World's newest theme park, Animal Kingdom. This Kingdom is 500
Central Florida acres reconfigured into deep green jungles, forests
and savanna and strikingly what one might expect to see at an
animal reserve in Africa.
The Kilimanjaro Safari is definitely the highlight of the park.
Include it at the beginning of your trip. It's the one with the
longest line. Our wait was short compared with other busy days. It
was a 30-minute wait for the 22-minute ride. And Disney has taken
long waits into consideration and orchestrated that here, too.
And a little later, under a thatched hut, rows of
close-captioned TVs show a video, produced by the Harambe Wildlife
Preserve, a primer on safari wildlife with a built-in plea to help
protect all wildlife.
There are no visible barriers between you and the animals as you
take your ride through the Harambe Preserve, but signs posted
throughout the park ask that you not feed the animals or drop trash
that might injure them.
Disney did, in fact, have a few animals die en route to Animal
Kingdom and some when they arrived. According to Time magazine,
among the casualties were four cheetah cubs, two hippos and two
rhinos. Two otters also died, one after gorging itself on seeds
from loquat trees. Disney uprooted the trees and removed them from
the Preserve. Two African crown cranes also died, one after darting
out in front of one of the Safari lollies. According to Time,
they've since moved the cranes to a walking trail and installed
more mirrors on the vehicles so drivers have better sight lines.
If you can tolerate standing in line again, experts say to take
the trip two or three times, since you never know which animals
will appear at any given time or what they'll be doing once you see
them. A good example of this occurred after our Kilimanjaro ride.
We followed, on foot, the path to the Gorilla Falls Exploration
Trail, where a mother and her 6-month-old baby were being viewed by
a huge group gathered behind glass.
