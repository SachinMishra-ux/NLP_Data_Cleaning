Coincidence or not: The Institute was co-founded by Morley

adviser to Gore.
 Bookmark it! CMP, the Long Island-based trade-press
publisher, soon will unveil a new Web site that makes it easier to
find electronics industry information.
CMP has taken the contents of dozens of its pubs among them EE
Times and Windows magazine and made it accessible from a single
page. It combines a search engine with a Yahoo-like set of
categories that point to sub-topics like semiconductors, PCs,
finance, etc.
Other Web sites, notably Cnet and ZDNet, put tons of great
tech-type info online. But I think CMP has a better way to let
people quickly zero in on just what they want.
The site won't be open to the public until Monday, but Chronicle
readers can get a peek today at www.cmpnet.com/search.
 Questionable taste? If it's such a boom time in Silicon
Valley, why did a recent survey of car dealers find that the
lowball Ford Taurus was the top-selling car in Santa Clara County
last year, while the Mercedes-Benz E-class was 15th on the list?
Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

ATLANTA Once upon a time, if you wanted to be techno-cool it
was enough to have an e-mail account and a fast computer.
Nowadays that won't get you into the club. So if the real geeks
and gurus edge away from you at work, I am here today to bring you
a message of hope. You, too, can be a geek, even if you think IRQ
once invaded Kuwait and the chips you are most familiar with come
in a bag.
Even better, I'll show you several free ways to join the digital
elite. Once you've followed these simple steps, Bill Gates still
may not send you a Christmas card, but you'll gain new respect from
all those who wear propellers on their hats.
