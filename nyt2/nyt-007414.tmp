Saturday's newspapers focused on that battle as well as the game
against the U.S., but it was clear that the soccer team is
identified with reform.
Iran is at a crossroads. Its 60 million people are testing the
limits of new personal freedoms and emerging from years of war and
world isolation.
So, when Sunday's game starts in Lyon, France, at 11:30 p.m.
Tehran time (mid-afternoon Eastern time), almost all Iranians will
be watching, but at home.
Community centers had planned to show the game on big screens,
but those plans were scrapped out of what many see as government
concern that a win or tie could spark highly un-religious street
celebrations in the early morning.
There is the usual soccer fanaticism a fan recently scoured
the downtown strip of sports stores buying up 1,000 Iranian jerseys
for friends in the United States. Some universities postponed exams
and people have delayed summer vacations until after the World Cup
Tournament.
But the love of Iranian soccer is better illustrated by impish
nine-year-old Samayeh Hemati. Under the required head scarf and
black cape, there's a soccer fan in blue jeans and sneakers.
She plays with the boys in the street and saves a picture of her
favorite Iranian forward.
Women might be the country's biggest fans, though they cannot
play on organized teams. When the team qualified for the tournament
in December, men and women danced side-by-side in the streets. The
ruling religious Mullahs were nervous, but did not dare try to stop
them.
It had been 20 years since Iran made it to the World Cup. Since
then, Iranians replaced a brutal, American-backed, dictator with a
popular, but stern, Islamic revolution. They stormed the U.S.
Embassy in 1979, holding 52 Americans captive for 444 days. Later,
the Iranians saw one of their airliners shot down by a U.S. Navy
missile.
Last year they surprised the world by electing President
Mohammad Khatami, who promised to loosen the strict religious codes
if he can hold off the more powerful religious conservatives.
