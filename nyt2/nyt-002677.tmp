Mailman Malone stands alone, unless he is communing with John
Stockton on the pick-and-roll. That has been his message, and he
has delivered his share of politically incorrect diatribes, on
subjects ranging from Magic Johnson's popular return in 1992 (he
thought it wasn't a good idea) to the league's formerly hailed drug
policy (he thought it wasn't getting the job done). But these last
two springs, finally making it to the finals and the league's
premier stage, Malone has found himself face-to-face with the
ultimate establishment icon. It has become immeasurably difficult
to have his say in the face of true greatness.
Malone, the man the Jazz must follow to win, tried on Sunday
night to make a statement, clearing his throat by hitting his first
six shots. He scored 12 first-quarter points, but when he looked up
at the scoreboard, the Jazz had 14 and were trailing by 3.
This raised another sobering issue: the Bulls' ability to
control Stockton's dribble penetration with their long-limbed
defenders. Stockton is not as quick as he used to be, and this
becomes much more noticeable against a tough-minded Eastern
Conference team with a big, physical presence like Ron Harper than
it does against those sprouts-and-tomato defenders out West. Elvis'
team contests the kings of pick-and-roll a bit better than the
Lakers did, and Malone pays the price on the back end.
Over the last six minutes of the second quarter, the Jazz's
offense devolved into the Knicks'. Malone became quiet after Dennis
Rodman relieved Luc Longley. In one embarrassing run of wasted
possessions, Malone ran over Scottie Pippen on the break, Bryon
Russell turned a simple and uncontested inbounds pass to Stockton
into a backcourt violation, Stockton lost the ball deep in the
lane, Malone traveled in the post, then he threw up an air ball off
a runner in the lane.
Get the picture? Jordan and Toni Kukoc did, immediately abusing
their men off the dribble, rocketing the lead to 18 by the half and
creating visions of another trophy ceremony by late Friday night.
When Kukoc penetrates the way he did on Sunday night, forget it,
Chicago's panting sportswriters may as well begin the campaign to
keep this group together another five years.
Stockton most ominously finished with more turnovers (5) than
points (2). There were uncontested Chicago dunks. Jordan and Pippen
rested on the bench with impish smiles that gave way to raucous
laughter. The Bulls were cruising, in control of the series, ahead
in the backstretch.
A major event had to be canceled the day before it was scheduled
to take place. Two fighters (Akinwande and Ray Mercer) tested
positive for hepatitis B. Maria Nieves-Garcia couldn't fight
because she's 21 months pregnant. And Roberto Duran had his purse
garnished in a child-support case.
One, why isn't medical testing done well in advance of major
fights to avoid last-minute cancellations? Didn't we learn anything
from the scheduled Tommy Morrison-Arthur Weathers fight in 1996,
which was canceled the day of the event when Morrison tested
positive for the virus that causes AIDS?
Holyfield and Akinwande (who were to make $10 million and $2.5
million, respectively), the promoters, Showtime, cable distributors
and many more stand to lose a fortune because of an ill-advised
policy on testing. (And that doesn't take into account fans who
made travel plans and purchased tickets, for which they presumably
will get refunds.)
New York, where the fight was scheduled to be held Saturday,
requires that test results be submitted a minimum of five days
before the fight. (California requires a test for hepatitis B 30
days before licensing but requires testing only once a year.)
