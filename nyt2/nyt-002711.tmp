The Giants the first-place San Francisco Giants had every
reason to fold it up Sunday afternoon. The flight out on Thursday
was bogged down with bad weather and airport delays. On Saturday,
they played a bullpen-draining 14-inning affair that ended after
midnight. And Sunday, they were down three runs to the Cardinals in
the seventh inning. It would have been perfectly acceptable to give
in and go home.
But that's not Dusty Baker's Giants. Sparked by a double by
pitcher Mark Gardner and a tie-breaking home run Jeff Kent, the
Giants turned this one around with a four-run seventh inning and
held on with some great pitching by closer Robb Nen for a 6-5 win
at Busch Stadium.
With the victory, the Giants completed their first three-game
sweep here in 14 years and extended their winning streak to a
season-best nine games.
It was the 20th comeback victory of the season for the Giants,
who were down 4-0 after the first inning when the Cardinals knocked
around starter Gardner. It's getting to be a trend for Gardner to
get whacked early he's given up two five-run first innings this
year to go along with Sunday's four-run start.
Gardner also knew he wouldn't be pulled anytime soon either. The
Giants' bullpen turned in 91/3 innings the night before and most of
the 'pen was unavailable.
Gardner did his job from there on, allowing just a run-scoring
double in the fifth inning by McGwire.
Given therapy between innings to get loose, Gardner's kinks
didn't seem to bother him at the plate. He lined a single in the
third inning, and in the sixth he had the key hit: When showing
bunt with a runner on first, he pulled the bat back and drilled a
double into the left-field corner off starter Kent Mercker.
With runners on second and third, Hamilton followed with a
two-run double to right that cut the Cardinals' lead to 5-4. It was
the second game in a row Hamilton has come up big. Saturday night,
Hamilton's two-run triple in the ninth inning sent the game into
extra innings.
Mercker, whose only blemishes before the sixth were a solo home
run by Brian Johnson and an RBI double by Kent, was losing it in
the seventh, but because the Cardinals' bullpen was in the same
terrible shape as the Giants', St. Louis manager Tony La Russa
stayed with his starter.
Mercker's inning only got worse when his wild pitch moved
Hamilton to third and Barry Bonds drove home the game-tying run
with deep sacrifice fly to center. Kent followed with the
tie-breaking home run into the right-center field stands. It was
his seventh homer of the season.
