Supporters of the measure contend that the legislation is needed
to put a cap on multimillion-dollar jury awards that are out of
control and inhibit manufacturers and add to consumer costs.
Opponents, like Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a
consumer group in Washington, argue that by limiting awards for
punitive damages, which are typically given to express anger at
reckless or outrageously negligent actions, there is little
incentive for manufacturers to stop making unsafe products.
In addition to battles over the merits of the argument, the
debate is being fought with millions of dollars in campaign
donations and lobbying fees. The trial lawyers are traditional
benefactors of the Democrats, while the manufacturers are among the
most generous sources of political donations for the Republicans.
It would for the first time set national standards for product
liability lawsuits, including preventing litigation against
retailers and wholesalers unless they had altered the product.
It would also prohibit lawsuits for damages caused by durable
goods like machine tools or tractors that were more than 18 years
old.
The bill's limits on punitive damages have been narrowed from
the original bill vetoed by Clinton, in which all companies would
have benefited. Under the current version, limits on punitive
damages would apply only to companies with fewer than 25 employees
or with annual revenues of less than $5 million. The limit on what
an injured person could collect would be $250,000 or twice the
actual damages a person suffers, that is, lost wages and medical
expenses.
The business community had been united in support of the
original bill. But when the punitive damages restriction was
limited to small businesses, the Civil Justice Reform Group,
composed of such companies as Du Pont, General Motors and Exxon,
recently wrote to Senator Lott saying it would not support the
legislation.
Rockefeller said that with the majority of the Senate's 55
Republicans supporting the bill along with about a dozen Democrats,
he is hopeful that there would be at least the 60 votes needed to
cut off any filibuster or extended debate.
SAN FRANCISCO It's the longest 468 yards in golf, a par 4 for
masochists. The fairway climbs to a slick green guarded by deep
bunkers and deep rough. As if its uphill length were not formidable
enough, it usually plays into a chill wind off the Pacific.
This is the 17th hole in Olympic's three-hole theater (of the
absurd?) where the 98th U.S. Open is very likely to be won and lost
Sunday. It begins with the 609-yard marathon 16th. It ends with the
18th's 347-yard tunnel of trouble.
