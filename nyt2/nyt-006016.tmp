The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
