One insider said the qualifying tournament for the 2000 Olympics
probably will be in March of that year, meaning NBA players would
be unable to participate because the season would be going on.
Without NBA players, the U.S. likely would not qualify for the
Olympics.
Stern, meanwhile, issued a strong declaration to the members of
the U.S. team that, should they decide not to honor their contracts
with USA Basketball, it would hurt them more than it would hurt the
NBA.
The U.S. roster for the World Championship must be submitted
this month to FIBA, Granik said. And so far, there are no changes,
in spite of pleas from NBA players union chief Patrick Ewing that
the players boycott the tournament.
Both geographically and culturally, California has always seemed
on the extreme edge of the United States. This is where the crazy
fashions start, from oat bran to surfing shorts to New Age
crystal-gazing.
It is where a black mayor can appear in Chinese robes on a
catwalk, and his rival can be photographed naked in the shower; it
is where anything goes, morally, spiritually or gastronomically,
except the lighting up of a cigarette in a bar.
Small wonder that many Americans have often dreamed of seeing
California, like some extravagant growth, painlessly removed from
the body politic.
There, a millionaire candidate, Al Checchi, who had spent around
$40 million on his campaign (a record, even for America) was
soundly beaten in the Democratic primary for the governorship; and
another millionaire, Darrell Issa, was beaten in the Republican
primary for the Senate.
Voters had more sense than to be swayed by these men's money,
which was a poor cover for the fact that they had no political
experience and the vaguest ideological convictions. Instead, they
opted for candidates whose careers commended them.
It was not a flawless choice: Gray Davis, the relatively
impoverished victor over Checchi, now owes a lot of money to the
special interests who helped him. But the result adds a hopeful
note to the endless debate about the proper role of money in
American elections.
Checchi's appearance on the scene was not, as some feared,
pernicious: he challenged the establishment at his own expense,
which was a good thing, but then found his millions did not sway
the voters, which was just as encouraging.
