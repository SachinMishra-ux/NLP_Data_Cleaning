Ever since his teen years, Harry Knox, 37, has wanted to be a
United Methodist minister. As a student at Emory University's
Candler School of Theology, he served as pastor of a tiny church
where two families had gay sons. Through the process of counseling
them, he says, he realized he could not be an effective minister
unless he came to terms with his own sexuality.
Copeland grew up in Snyder Memorial Baptist Church in
Fayetteville, N.C., and felt called to the ministry from age 16. By
his senior year at Wake Forest University, he was state president
of the Baptist Student Union, the Southern Baptist Convention's
college campus ministry. By that year he also knew he was gay.
He enrolled in Andover Newton Theological School in
Massachusetts, affiliated with the American Baptist Churches U.S.A.
and the United Church of Christ, but left because he felt compelled
to choose between being a minister and being gay.
After a year working in campus ministry, he entered the law and
theology program at Emory University(Ga.) intending to work in
social justice. In Atlanta, he joined Oakhurst Baptist Church, a
congregation affiliated with both the American Baptist Churches and
the Southern Baptist Convention. Two years later, he felt he could
no longer deny the call he felt to be a minister.
Kanour, 44, serves as assistant to the rector at St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in DeKalb County. In August 1997,
when she and her partner of three years were introduced, the
congregation gave them a standing ovation.
A native of Virginia, she was raised a Southern Baptist and
later became a Roman Catholic. She graduated from Oregon State
University, spent four years in the Marine Corps and then earned a
divinity degree from Yale University.
When her father died soon after she left the convent, she
returned home to Norfolk and found work as parish administrator at
Good Shepherd Episcopal Church. There, she decided she wanted to be
ordained a priest.
Since she was living in Atlanta three years later when she
completed preparation, Atlanta's Bishop Frank K. Allan ordained her
in 1991 on behalf of the bishop of southern Virginia.
Kanour spent a year in clinical pastoral education at Northside
Hospital, worked four years as a chaplain at Grady Memorial
Hospital's hospice, and became interim vicar at Emmaus House, a
south Atlanta
When Allan accepted her official transfer to the diocese last
year so that she could serve in a parish, Kanour became the first
openly gay person received for official clergy status in the
diocese.
