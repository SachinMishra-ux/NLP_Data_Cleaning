He added, though, that the number of Palm Beach County brush
fires so far this year is below normal because a wet winter delayed
the November start of the brush fire season by two months.
So far this month, less than one-half inch of rain has fallen in
Palm Beach County, according to the National Weather Service. The
norm by this time of month is about 4.9 inches.
Baker said he hopes that forecast comes through. If not, South
Florida risks drying up like North Florida, where weeklong brush
fires have threatened homes and led to evacuations, he said.
Elsewhere Sunday, wildfires closed a stretch of Interstate 95,
kept dozens of evacuated residents near Deland away from their
homes and consumed 10,000 acres of forest owned by paper and timber
companies in north-central Florida.
Firefighters battled blazes in at least 19 counties. Eighty-six
fires had been started in the past 24 hours, mostly by lighting
strikes, and 80 to 90 new fires were expected daily unless Florida
received some rainfall, officials said.
Since Memorial Day, fires have burned 72 homes and 41 other
structures in Florida. President Clinton has declared the entire
state a fire disaster area, and a statewide, outdoor, burning ban
remains in effect, indefinitely.
The U.S. Forest Service said that 80 percent of the state was at
a drought index level equivalent to a desert. A heat wave continued
to hover over most of the state.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. It was remorse, detectives say, that led
wealthy murder suspect Isaac Benarroch to fire a .40 caliber gun
into his own chest a year ago.
But his remorse wasn't over the death of Richardo La Bergere,
the suburban West Palm Beach man police suspect Benarroch ordered
killed. Nor, police say, was it over Zvika Yuz, a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. man who like La Bergere was shot to death after receiving
death threats from Benarroch.
Instead, detectives say, Benarroch, 64, a Venezuelan living in
North Miami, Fla., killed himself at an exclusive Georgia resort
because he'd squandered his vast inheritance and would otherwise
have little to leave his children.
