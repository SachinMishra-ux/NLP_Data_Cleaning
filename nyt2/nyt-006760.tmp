A: I don't know for sure. I see it going at least seven years
(next season will be No. 6), and anything on top of that will be
gravy. I'd like to see the TV series become a movie series. It all
depends on the success of this movie.
Q: What will those last episodes have to be like to satisfy the
hard-core fans?
A: I'm excited about the idea that I'll have a place to go. What
I'll end up getting to do is set up the next movie by what I do in
those TV shows.
Q: You've tried to keep everything secret, so what's with the
hidden track at the end of the CD? (At the end of the movie
soundtrack, Carter talks for a few minutes about the conspiracy.)
A: It really tells you what you've seen in the series. It
doesn't tell you anything that you see in the movie. I thought it
was an opportunity to give something a little special to people who
were paying attention.
A: Sometimes I wonder. The show has been a miracle in many ways.
So many things have gone right that could have gone wrong. I think
its timing was perfect. The advances in science we are conducting
right now make it possible. Imagine trying to do this show without
cell phones.
Q: Do you get a fiendish glee out of all the blind alleys that
fans pursue on the Internet?
A:Absolutely. It's so weird to me to have created something that
has spawned so much speculation, so much talk. It just blows my
mind when I go on the Internet and see people chatting.
A: It's best kept a secret. You write things down, they tend to
get stale, like bread. Ideas should be kept fresh in your head and
never let out until the point you're ready to use them. If you tell
too many people, it dissipates the energy. And no one can steal
them if they're in your head.
In a landmark sexual harassment case, a Massachusetts man has
won more than $800,000 from the Norton Company, where he claims he
was harassed on the job by another man for 3 1/2 years.
