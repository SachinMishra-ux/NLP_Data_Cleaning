Some legal experts believe that many of these cases will
disappear or fail because they were filed simply to be in a
position to cash in on a potential congressional settlement of
tobacco litigation. And officials of tobacco companies, which have
been largely unscathed in court, say they are confident they will
continue to prevail.
But the rapidly accelerating pace of lawsuits is also producing
a high-speed game of legal Russian roulette for those companies.
And every courtroom wound suffered by the industry, like a recent
$1 million verdict in Florida, is likely to bring still more
lawsuits, legal experts said.
Robert Rabin, a professor at Stanford University School of Law,
said he believed the industry had the resources to lose half of the
individual lawsuits brought against it as long as the number of
such cases annually ranged from 100 to 200 claims. But Rabin said
he foresees a litigation landslide if juries start giving out large
punitive-damage awards or if class-action claims like one set to
begin in Florida next month succeed.
In the Florida case, producers face the first class-action
lawsuit ever brought to trial on behalf on smokers throughout a
state claiming addiction or tobacco-related injuries. And in
September, the industry faces another legal test when the trial of
a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Washington state to
recover Medicaid expenses begins.
Joe Rice, a plaintiffs' lawyer from Charleston, S.C., who
represents 29 states, said that he was only aware of court efforts
to mediate state attorneys general lawsuits in Washington and New
York.
Tobacco-industry lawyers said that they are ready to take on all
comers. And they add the industry's decision to pay out some $35
billion over the past year to settle lawsuits brought by four
states Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota did not
reflect the weakness of their legal position, but rather the legal
quirks of those cases and the industry's eagerness not to upset
momentum for a national resolution.
Little and other industry lawyers point to a number of recent
victories in which tobacco companies managed to have thrown out
lawsuits brought by union health plans against them on procedural
grounds or have some of the damage claims in lawsuits brought by
state attorneys general thrown out.
But even some lawyers who have worked closely with the industry
said tobacco makers now faced a new host of legal challenges
because damaging industry documents had been recently disclosed as
part of those settlements and were already being put to use against
the industry.
Earlier this month, for example, a Florida jury, which reviewed
documents initially obtained by the state of Minnesota, ordered
Brown Williamson Tobacco Co. to pay $1 million, including
$500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a man whose death
from cancer was blamed on cigarettes. And lawyers handling the
Florida class-action claim are now battling in court to use the
Minnesota records in their case.
It was the desire to end legal uncertainty that led five major
tobacco companies to pursue last June's $368.5 billion settlement
proposal with state attorneys generals and class-action lawyers.
That plan, under which producers agreed to restrict tobacco
advertising and pay penalties if youth smoking did not fall,
settled state lawsuits and barred class-action lawsuits and the
awarding of punitive damages.
