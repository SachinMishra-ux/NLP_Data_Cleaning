Other analysts are less pessimistic, saying the economy is
likely to continue growing, albeit at a more moderate pace, through
the second half. And debate continues among economists about
whether Asia's effects alone will cool the domestic economy
sufficiently to avert the need for an inflation-fighting
interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve Board.
But the trade figures underscored the stake the United States
has in helping to bring Asia's downward economic spiral under
control.
Asia's troubles have so far brought as many benefits as
drawbacks to the United States, including lower interest rates that
have helped fuel a housing boom and allowed many homeowners to save
money by refinancing their mortgages. But in the long run,
economists said, the nation needs financial stability and economic
growth abroad to sustain the vibrant domestic expansion that began
in 1991.
Fearful that a long slide in the value of the Japanese currency
could exacerbate Asia's problems and infect the rest of the world,
the Clinton administration joined with the Japanese government on
Wednesday to buy yen, a move that administration officials
acknowledged was only a temporary measure.
The White House has been pushing Japan to do more to revive its
own economy and help the rest of Asia. And the administration has
been pressing Congress to provide more financing for the
International Monetary Fund in case the financial instability
spreads.
The trade deficit has grown steadily throughout this year as
Japan slipped into recession and the economies of Indonesia,
Thailand, South Korea and other big markets spiraled downward.
The growth in the deficit has been pushed along in recent months
by the steep decline in the yen's value, reflecting the deep-rooted
financial and economic problems bedeviling Japan at a time when the
United States has been enjoying steady growth and low inflation.
The rise in the dollar relative to the yen makes American
products more expensive in Japan and makes Japanese products less
expensive in the United States. Although the trade deficit with
Japan narrowed in April, to $5.4 billion from $5.8 billion in
March, economists said they expect the deficit to increase in
coming months, reflecting the sharp runup in the dollar relative to
the yen between April and this week's intervention in the currency
markets.
The deficit with China expanded to $4.3 billion in April from
$3.8 billion a month earlier. President Clinton leaves next week on
a trip to China, and he is expected to press China to lower trade
barriers to improve its chances of joining the World Trade
Organization and help defuse political tensions with the United
States.
The cumulative deficit with the Pacific Rim nations alone for
the first four months of this year was $46.7 billion, a 38 percent
increase over the same period last year.
