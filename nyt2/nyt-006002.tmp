JetHawks right-hander Brian Sweeney struck out the side
sandwiched between a walk in his one inning to earn the pitching
victory.
The Freeway Division started quickly when San Bernardino's Rich
Saitta hit the 1-2 pitch of San Jose's Jason Grote over the
right-center-field fence for a home run leading off the game.
Twice the Valley Division tied the score but fell behind a run,
the last time in the top of the fifth when JetHawks ace Patrick
Dunham allowed the go-ahead run on Luke Allen's RBI single.
This All-Star game meant as much to Visalia's Duane Filchner
than perhaps to any of the remaining 43 players. The 25-year-old,
in his fourth season with the Oakland A's organization, retired
following the game in favor of a position in the athletic
department at Radford University.
Filchner participated in the pregame home run contest and
thrilled the crowd by going deep 12 times in the opening round.
Filchner, who singled in three at-bats as the starting designated
hitter, reached the finals against Modesto's McKay. After each hit
one home run, McKay defeated his Oakland teammate with a homer over
the fence in right in a one-pitch tiebreaker. Combining the three
rounds, Filchner actually outhomered McKay 19-18.
Tuesday's 10-6 loss to the San Diego Padres at Qual Comm Stadium
dropped them 10{ games back in the National League West, the
largest deficit they have faced in almost five years.
Those kinds of numbers are numbing for a team that was
overhauled a month ago in hopes of bringing it back to life. So far
it hasn't happened. What is next? Firing Bill Russell? Benching
Bobby Bonilla?
They knew coming to San Diego they were facing the hottest team
in baseball. The Padres (45-25) now have eight consecutive
victories and reclaimed the National League West lead by sweeping
San Francisco over the weekend.
The Dodgers, who appeared to have passed the .500 mark for good
Friday, have dropped three in a row and are 34-35.
It is bad enough that Ramon Martinez could be facing
season-ending surgery after reinjuring his right shoulder on
Sunday. It didn't help that Chan Ho Park failed to step into
Martinez's role as the staff ace.
