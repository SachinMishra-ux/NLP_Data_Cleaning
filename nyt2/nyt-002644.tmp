Bob Baffert, the trainer of Silver Charm last year and Real
Quiet this year, both dramatic Triple Crown losers, defines the
product correctly. For all the glory of his Triple Crown classics,
he still hasn't won in eight starts on New York tracks. But he
insists that's the nature of the game.
Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, fractured his ankle
playing pick-up basketball last week and had to tend his horse on
crutches. He even enlisted a superstar trainer, Bill Mott, to
saddle Victory Gallop in the paddock for the Belmont, so give Mott
an assist. Walden doesn't miss the point, either.
But they had better hurry. In the last six months, racing has
lost two of its best tracks: Arlington Park in Chicago and Atlantic
City. Can slot machines be far behind?
Maybe you can't count on the enormous pull of the Belmont Stakes
to solve all your problems day by day. But how can you not start
with those 80,162 fans, the national television audience and those
two brave horses who carried the racing business into the minds and
wallets of America?
In the banking industry's latest megamerger, Norwest Corp. of
Minneapolis and Wells Fargo Co. of San Francisco plan to join
forces and may announce the $34 billion deal as early as Monday,
according to people close to both companies.
Although the transaction is structured as a so-called merger of
equals, Norwest's chief executive, Richard Kovacevich, will run the
combined company as chief executive while Wells' chief executive,
Paul Hazen, will relinquish that post.
The new bank will be based in San Francisco and retain the Wells
Fargo name. With combined assets of $185 billion, it will rank as
the sixth-largest bank in the United States if all other bank
mergers announced this year are completed.
The logic of the merger follows a now familiar pattern: Many
banks, stuck in an industry with little revenue growth and
heightened competition from brokerage firms, mutual funds and
credit-card companies, see size as a solution to their woes.
Bulking up, banks believe, will enable them to become more
profitable by dominating certain markets and enjoying greater
economies of scale.
It is the latest in a string of bank-related blockbusters this
year that have surprised Wall Street, including the mergers of
Citicorp and Travelers Group, BankAmerica Corp. and Nationsbank
Corp. and First Chicago NBD and Banc One Corp.
Kovacevich, considered to be one of the most disciplined and
talented executives in banking, said in a recent interview that he
felt no need to merge with another bank and that he found the
recent prices being paid for banks to be exorbitant.
