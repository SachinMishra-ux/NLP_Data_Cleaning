NEW YORK Detectives are searching for a 25-year-old man
accused of stabbing his former girlfriend in her family's home in
Middle Village, Queens, Sunday morning and then turning the knife
on the woman's parents, killing her mother, when they tried to
rescue her.
Deputy Inspector Martin Johnson of Queens detectives said police
were searching for Heather Grech's former boyfriend, Robert
Parsell, who they believe committed the crime after his attempt to
reconcile with Ms. Grech failed.
Detectives said that Parsell, a milk truck driver, apparently
was upset after Ms. Grech left him last week and moved, with their
1{-year-old son, back to her parents' home at 69-26 61st Rd.,
police said. He grew desperate Saturday, they said, when he heard
that she had been seen with another man.
At that point Ms. Grech's older brother, David, awoke to the
sound of screams, ran downstairs and chased Parsell out of the
house, police said.
The brutal crime stunned neighbors in Middle Village, a quiet
community of two-family homes. Anne Russo, 35, said she was walking
home from a diner with her boyfriend when she saw Tristan Grech run
out of his house, bleeding from his arms and shoulders.
Neighbors said Kathleen Grech worked as a bookkeeper in
Manhattan and that her husband worked as a limousine driver. They
worshiped regularly at Our Lady of Hope Roman Catholic Church. On
Sunday, a priest from the church went to the house to administer
last rites to Mrs. Grech.
Heather Grech and Robert Parsell had been dating since she was a
student at the Mary Louis Academy, neighbors said. Police said Ms.
Grech had tried to leave him before, but they added that they had
never received reports of domestic violence.
For the last two months they lived in a three-bedroom apartment
on the second floor of a house at 64-30 65th Place. Neighbors there
said they disliked Parsell, whom they described as antisocial, but
added that they were surprised to hear he was wanted for murder.
Because of its strong store sales and easy-to-understand
business, Restoration Hardware may have single-handedly restored a
modicum of faith in the withering initial offering market.
