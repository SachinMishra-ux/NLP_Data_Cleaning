There also will be more than 5,000 plainclothes members of the
French security force roaming venues and cities. On game days, the
French Interior Ministry will deploy up to 6,000 police officers to
stadium sites.
World Cup security officials hope that efforts such as last
month's pre-emptive strike against the Algerian Armed Islamic Group
will avert potential terrorism by sending a signal that terrorist
groups are being monitored.
Regarding the most common threat at international soccer
matches, fan violence, security leaders appear to be happy with
their strategy but unhappy with World Cup ticketing and other
policies.
In fact, the system for ticket sales might even encourage
rowdiness, some believe. Nearly 90 percent of all tickets for the
Cup were sold to the French. The idea was to simultaneously give
the home team an edge while limiting the number of tickets to
potential troublemakers from abroad.
Much of the world criticized France's ticketing policy from the
moment it was implemented. The exceptions were ticket brokers and
scalpers. Already, brokers reportedly have sold more than 20,000
tickets to English fans alone, at prices up to 40 times their face
value. Fans from Italy, Germany, The Netherlands and Spain are
scooping up scalped tickets at a record pace, too.
The result could be that instead of fans being grouped by
nationality at events, they will be mixed together, potentially an
explosive situation.
Security personnel also are lamenting the organizers' decision
to send each team to three different cities for first-round
matches. Usually, each team plays a pair of matches in one city and
a third elsewhere, which encourages fans to establish a home base
of sorts.
This summer, with fans from rival countries mixing daily at
train stations and airports, more dangerous clashes could occur.
Most every security decision at stadiums clearly was made with
the most notorious offenders in mind the English and Dutch. The
English federation is expected to bring a large group of British
police to every game, with each officer carrying portfolios on
ringleaders.
Some English and Dutch matches also will not be shown on giant
screens erected outside of stadiums, which will be the norm
elsewhere, in an effort to discourage ticketless thugs from showing
up in an area where there is sure to be stifling heat and cheap
wine in abundance.
