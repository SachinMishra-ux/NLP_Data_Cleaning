There were many famous brand names on the auction block,
including Rolex and Movado, but those made by Patek Philippe,
founded in Switzerland in 1839 and known for its sophisticated
workmanship, attracted the most attention.
The same German collector who bought the Ellington watch also
bought a Patek Philippe World Time wristwatch, in pink gold with
fancy hands and a revolving ring dial bearing the names of 41
cities, for $662,500. Total sales at the auction were $5.55
million.
