NEW YORK Bowing to pressure from federal prosecutors, the New
York City Police Department has agreed to overhaul its system for
investigating sexual harassment complaints and
gender-discrimination charges within the department.
The policy changes came as part of a settlement, announced
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, of a lawsuit the
government filed against the department. The department has also
agreed to strengthen its policy against displaying pornographic
materials in station houses, to increase the staffing of its Office
of Equal Opportunity Employment to 30 investigators, from 20, and
to start mandatory programs to teach all 38,000 officers and
commanders procedures for preventing and reporting sexual
harassment.
The U.S. attorney's office sought the stricter standards two
years ago, after a former police officer filed a lawsuit alleging
that her commanders at the 110th Precinct in Elmhurst, Queens, had
ignored complaints that male officers routinely watched
pornographic movies in the lounge of the station house and posted
photographs of naked women on the station's walls.
After reviewing the officer's charges, Mary Jo White, the U.S
attorney for the Southern District, also sued the department,
saying that tougher standards and more vigilant enforcement were
needed to protect female police employees.
The lawsuit was the first of its kind to be filed by the
government against a city police department, and Ms. White said
Thursday that the settlement, which allows the U.S. attorney to
review all of the department's harassment investigations, was an
encouraging sign that police commanders might improve their efforts
in the future.
Deborah Zoland, the police lawyer who negotiated the settlement,
said the lengthy court battle helped police commanders improve
their policies by viewing their anti-harassment measures from an
outside perspective. Ms. Zoland said the pact would ultimately make
the department more active in preventing workplace harassment.
Ms. Goff's complaint also charged that a supervisor once
humiliated her in front of other officers by suggesting she have a
bulletproof vest specially designed to accommodate her breasts. Ms.
Goff, who no longer works for the department, has an unlisted
telephone number and could not be reached for comment.
Police policy already forbids officers to display inappropriate
material in department buildings, but under the guidelines adopted
Thursday, the desk commanders in each precinct must now inspect
their buildings at the start of each shift and immediately
confiscate any pornography. Police officials also agreed to add new
sections to the department's patrol guide that strengthen the
requirements to report any harassment and to include a new section
in supervisors' performance evaluations that grades their
sensitivity to harassment complaints.
But neither federal officials nor police commanders would
discuss how the settlement would affect another recent sexual
harassment case in the Police Department. In that case, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir overruled the recommendation of his
commissioner for Equal Employment Opportunity that a high-level
commander be disciplined for failing to respond properly to a
female officer's harassment charges.
Richard Holbrooke is living proof that you do not have to win
friends to influence people. The most undiplomatic of diplomats, he
is nevertheless persuasive enough to be a good choice for the post
of Washington's representative to the United Nations. The man he
replaces, Bill Richardson, is his stylistic opposite, an
Olympic-class schmoozer. He, in turn, knows Washington and the
relevant issues well enough to make a solid energy secretary.
