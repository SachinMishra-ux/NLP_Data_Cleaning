 Some years ago, cartoonist Dan O'Neill incurred the wrath of
Disney with a drawing of Mickey Mouse in an un-family-rated
position. The cartoonist lost a legal battle that was fought all
the way to the Supreme Court.
Recently, however, posters heralding Janet Jackson 's
performances in Sweden featured a photograph showing her personal
homage to Mickey: an X-rated tattoo on her inner thigh, based on
O'Neill's drawing.
 Linda McCartney was working on vegetarian fish cakes when
she died, and a spokesman has announced that her vegetarian food
line will soon be expanded to include this delicacy. Sales of
vegetarian food in England are said to have soared in response to
her death.
Well, not really. But I am the 50-something guy you may have
seen in summertime Manhattan going about his business clad in coat
and tie, dressy loafers (no socks) and what used to be called
Bermuda shorts. I didn't set out to become an ensign of men's
style, but one I seem to have become, recognized uptown and down by
my . . . knees. From Park Avenue to Broadway, Columbus Circle to
Wall Street, customarily blase New Yorkers see me coming and step
aside, not quite sure whether to shun me as a trampler of the
proprieties or salute me as a breeze of sensibility.
The answer was, and is, Not before Memorial Day. There are
standards. And to be perfectly honest about it, when the shorts go
on, the pants go off for the duration, and Memorial Day has proved
a fairly safe cutoff date. There are no standards at the end of the
cycle, however. The pants come back when it seems foolish still to
be in shorts (last year, on Sept. 26).
Not everyone, however, is quite so mellow. A couple of years
ago, I was invited to lunch with friends at the Yale Club. I wore
an appropriately blue-and-white seersucker suit, truncated. We met
in the second-floor lounge for drinks before proceeding to the
21st-floor terrace. But I didn't get to proceed. When the waiter
came to take a second drink order, he suggested in a tone brooking
no dissent that I would be happier having another club soda and a
fillet of whatever elsewhere. A Member has complained, sir.
What I wanted to say to that hidebound Member was that shorts,
or something approximating them, have been with us longer than
trousers. That empires have been won, defended and lost in them.
And that in many civilized places Bermuda, naturally, which isn't
even tropical, as well as innumerable other hot-weather dens of
respectability short pants are de rigueur business attire. But I
didn't. I left, walking out as arrogantly as possible.
That I have become a symbol of sartorial liberation says less
about me than about what wimps corporate men have turned into as
they don their dry-cleaned dungarees, Missoni sweaters and $200
sneakers to proclaim their dressed-down sang-froid. Men on the go
wear shorts firemen, mailmen, deliverymen, to name a few so why
not men on the sit? Once in a while I do encounter a fellow
coat-and-tied shorts wearer, but he usually ends up being a
salesman in SoHo rather than a captain, or even a noncom, of
industry. When it comes to having the power of their convictions
about easygoing clothes, businessmen apparently have neither power
nor convictions.
(Fashionwise, which isn't really the point but certainly is a
point, I like pleated cotton shorts in solid colors, with a seven-
or eight-inch inseam. Since mine is a weather-driven conceit, I
don't wear socks. Knee socks may look great in Bermuda, but for my
glands, wrapping the lower legs in anything defeats the purpose.
And esthetically speaking, the sight of shorts anchored in dark
ankle-length socks is enough to make me think about putting long
pants back on.)
Now that I've been wearing shorts long enough to be cranky about
those who don't and won't, and long enough to have been evicted
from the Yale Club, consider this a call to knees, an invitation to
join me in casting aside the legs of convention.
