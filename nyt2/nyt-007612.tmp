The plan also called for the construction of various roads,
including a beltway in East Jerusalem, and for the investment of
money into the creation of high-tech industry.
One major government concern addressed by the expansion plan was
the fact that Jerusalem has been losing secular and prosperous
middle-class residents in recent years because of the rapid growth
of the relatively poor strictly Orthodox population in the city.
Another government concern is that the Palestinian population in
Jerusalem has been growing at a greater rate than the Jewish
population. A 1995 census put the city's total population at
591,400, with 417,000 Jews and 174,400 Arabs.
At a press conference Sunday, Netanyahu and the mayor of
Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, were relatively cautious in spelling out
the goals of the project.
In the same tone, Netanyahu vowed that construction would soon
begin on Har Homa, the site of a proposed Jewish neighborhood in
southeastern Jerusalem whose announcement 16 months ago was
fiercely condemned by the Palestinians.
Super Bowl MVP John Elway skipped a trip to the White House last

Cheerio, MJ: Kellogg had planned to issue a Corn Flakes box
featuring the NBA champion Chicago Bulls on the front, but the NBA
said the company couldn't because Michael Jordan is a spokesman for
General Mills, which makes Wheaties.
The NBA and Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg said earlier this
month they had an agreement for Kellogg to be the NBA's
breakfast-food sponsor. They planned to issue a commemorative
cereal box with the championship winner.
While inflation over all is at its lowest rate since the 1960s,
prices have been rising rather noticeably in recent months for a
variety of everyday items from fast-food hamburgers to auto
maintenance and dental care.
Consider the experience of John Gachelin, a 28-year-old
marketing executive, who moved with his wife to Dallas from
Chicago, in part to lower their living costs. Unlike Illinois,
Texas has no state income tax. And houses cost less. But in the
seven months since the move, the Gachelins have been hit with steep
price increases to rent videos, change the oil in their two cars,
buy cigarettes (he smokes), use a pay phone and buy hardcover
books.
What softens the blow for the Gachelins and many others are the
prices that are not rising. Most of the essentials food,
gasoline, cars, furniture, appliances, everyday apparel are
holding steady in price or becoming cheaper. That is why the
Consumer Price Index, which is an average of the prices of
thousands of goods and services, has risen by only 1.7 percent over
the last year.
