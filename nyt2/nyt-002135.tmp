Mickey Galloway gave me a shopping visit to his woods, where I
dug as many hemlocks and white pines as my car would haul (I need a
truck). The little trees promise to grow as big and fine as their
older siblings.
And the plantings continue. In some ways, they reflect our
effort to embrace and complement and extend nature's beauty, to
bring it right up to our own doors. To bring it home. And, yes, to
show ownership and exert control of our spaces, too.
Sometimes we do this with plants directly out of the verdant
landscape, sometimes with plants straight from the nursery (or
friends' gardens). Regardless, each plant integrates us with
nature. Each puts a green stamp on the plot that holds our home.
Ginnie Hart, a 52-year-old preacher's kid, former Bible
translator and ex-wife of an evangelical missionary, has spent much
of her life studying or teaching the Scriptures.
Today, as an openly lesbian United Methodist, Hart teaches Bible
classes, attended mostly by gays and lesbians, that focus on how
she believes the Bible has been misused against homosexuals.
Q: What is your position on the ordination of sexually active
homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions?
A: I do not believe there is any reason in Scripture, based on
homosexuality alone, to deny ordination. I would want to know
whether a person, gay or straight, is abusive or unfaithful. Those
are the larger questions.
And when people want to be committed to each other and make that
a public statement, I think the church ought to support them. I
believe one of the problems in the gay community is that we are not
able to make our commitments publicly or openly. It's real easy to
get out of a relationship few people know you're in.
A: It's the age-old problem of separating the body from the soul
or spirit. Historically, we've had that dichotomy in the church.
All this is a part of who I am. My sexuality, my spirituality,
everything about me is meant to be integrated. To say that it's OK
to be gay as long as you don't `do it' is like saying it's OK to be
hungry but don't eat. It's preposterous.
A: If we can't find a place in the church where we can find the
name and learn what it means to be homosexual that sexually,
emotionally and spiritually I am going to be bonded more closely to
women than to men where are we going to find it? Where are we
going to be nurtured and supported? If the church is not going to
be a place where we can learn to be soulful and holy and whole,
where are we going to learn that?
