The election of Andres Pastrana, the Conservative former mayor
of Bogota, over Horacio Serpa of the Liberal Party, Samper's
interior minister and most loyal advocate, opens a new chapter in
Colombia's relations with the United States, which have boiled over
with bitterness and suspicion during Samper's four years in power.
The unusually strong showing of Pastrana who won a higher
number of votes than any previously elected president and a high
turnout came in sharp contrast to public opinion surveys, all of
which had shown the two candidates virtually tied for the
presidency and had predicted a low voter turnout.
Rangel predicted that relations with the United States would
improve dramatically with Sunday's election of Pastrana, probably
entering a new era of closeness and cooperation between the two
countries.
Under Samper, who was acused of accepting $6 million from drug
dealers in his election campaign and who was stripped of his U.S.
visa two years ago, U.S. officials cultivated ties with other
individuals or agencies like the chief of police, Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano while largely avoiding direct encounters with the
president.
While Pastrana may enjoy strong electoral backing, the Congress
here remains heavily Liberal. Ingrid Betancur, a Liberal deputy who
has been supporting Pastrana's candidacy, said that Pastrana would
probably seek a public referendum to elect a new Congress as part
of an overall drive for political reform if he could not govern
with the current Congress.
As president elect, Pastrana's first order of business is
expected to be a direct meeting with the leader of the largest
rebel group that has been battling government security forces for
more than 30 years, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. He
pledges to hold such as meeting as early as next week if security
permits.
The two candidates' potential ability to negotiate an end to the
civil conflict that has claimed more than 30,000 lives in Colombia
was, along with the economy, a top issue in the campaign. With the
strong support of Colombia's business community and his
Conservative credentials unquestioned by the military, Pastrana
appears to have wide latitude for tackling the country's most
difficult problems.
In the final days of campaigning, Pastrana had pledged to meet
with Manuel Marulanda, the rebel leader, who had already met with
Pastrana's campaign chief the week before.
The rebel leader allowed the release of a photo of himself
talking with Pastrana's campaign manager, in what appeared to be a
silent endorsement of the Conservative candidate. That move struck
at the heart of Serpa's claim to be the candidate most capable of
negotiating peace talks, and it increased Pastrana's standing among
voters weary of the intractable civil conflict.
Pastrana has pledged to lead negotiations personally with the
leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and
with the smaller National Liberation Army and has agreed to a
guerrilla demand that government security forces evacuate five
municipalities during any peace negotiations. He has pledged
separate parallel talks with right-wing paramilitary leaders, who
have been demanding a say in any peace negotiations.
