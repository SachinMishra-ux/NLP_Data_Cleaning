Turning these quirks into true comedy demands a deep knowledge
and a sincere love of the form as well as a high level of
musicianship and vocal agility. One can only parody great
performers, after all, if one can approximate their strengths while
exaggerating their weaknesses. The Gran Scena Opera Company a
troupe of male singers who dress and act as divas, sing in falsetto
and perform under comic stage names (Gabriella
Tonnoziti-Casseruola, for example) has made a specialty of this
specialized brand of comedy since 1981.
The group performed at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday evening for
an audience that was enthusiastic enough to make an actual diva
jealous.
Centennials usually call for a lot of clanking celebration, a
period souvenir or two and perhaps some minor historical
revisionism. The 1898 observation, now under way in Spain, Cuba,
the Philippines and the United States, is a tough one. So much was
set in motion that it is difficult to contemplate how we got from
there to here.
Four months of fighting dispatched the remnants of a Spanish
empire dating to the landing of Columbus and gave rise to an
American empire and century, with entanglements, entitlements and
expectations yet to be fully sorted out.
The consensus of historians, whether second-guessers or those in
the academic mainstream, is that 1898 marked the death of one age
and the start of another.
Consider the United States at the start of that year. Geronimo
had surrendered, but his haunts of New Mexico and Arizona were
still territories and considered foreign land to many on the East
Coast. Americans commuted to work by bicycle. Though the shift from
rural to urban was well under way, the United States still thought
of itself as a nation of farmers and of Anglo-Saxons. Foreign wars
were for Europeans, the detested monarchs of the Old World.
The city strutted its new muscle. In 1898, by incorporating the
outer boroughs, New York City grew from 39 square miles to 320,
becoming the second biggest metropolis in the world, with a
population of 3.4 million. Only London was bigger.
At the same time, the United States had learned to shop, passing
Britain as the world's leading consumer society. With wealth,
unparalleled population growth, physical space and technology, all
it lacked was a place in the world.
That would be taken care of in part by the mysterious explosion
of the battleship Maine in Havana harbor on the evening of Feb. 15,
1898, which killed 266 American servicemen. The ship was in Cuba
ostensibly to protect American interests while rebels tried to
remove the hand of Spain from the island. These rebels had been
depicted at first as modern-day Jeffersons and Washingtons.
From 1875 to 1905, Britain added 5 million square miles to its
empire; France added 3 million. The United States stretched from
one ocean to the other, but it was for the first time without a
frontier. European expansion, long condemned, provided an excuse
for emulation. How the United States could go from condemning
European colonialism to trying to rule the 7,100 islands of the
distant Philippines is one of the driving questions.
