For three months after the accident, Shank couldn't see at all.
He spent the first two weeks on the couch deep in thought, but not
self-pity, even though he knew if he'd worn his glasses and not his
contacts, he would've been fine.
Shank never doubted he'd be able to see again. Looking at his
brown eyes, there's no way for an outsider to tell which one has
the implanted lens.
Shank, who got his first gun at age 6 and shot at GI Joes, golf
balls and pop cans, will report to Annapolis next month with a
medical waiver. He jokes that he won't be a fighter pilot, but
that's OK, because he's more interested in engineering and physics.
Shank has worked long hours with O'Connor this week to make up
for a month spent getting into shape for the academy.
He hopes to score 590 out of 600 during the 1 hour and 45
minutes he has to record 60 shots.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Leave it to Jack Nicklaus to put the U.S. Open
in perspective, while all about him there is much wailing, groaning
and gnashing of teeth. A pro from Ashtabula, who also owns cart
rights and runs weekend dog fights, snarls about the narrow
fairways. A reformed alcoholic, and assorted other tour types,
complain about pin placements.
Nicklaus had just come in Friday from sinking a putt from here
to Rhode Island, on the 18th green, damned and cursed by a chorus
of bellyachers, that kept him in town two more days. He'd made the
cut in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, playing with an honorary
exemption, assailed by Frank Hannigan, who left the USGA for TV, as
out of order. In this field of all the best, playing for the
championship of the nation, on a course that would bring a Marine
to his knees, the Old Man was going the distance.
What this did was send him out Saturday morning with a large
body, 230 pounds of vagabond pro from Illinois named Tom Sipula, a
qualifier who plays the Canadian Tour without distinction. Sipula
said he wasn't awed by the pairing, but he started out bogey,
bogey, double bogey and never recovered. Nicklaus beat him by
three. Nicklaus had squeaked in under the wire at 147. A pro from
Oklahoma, Rocky Walcher, had made a par putt on the treacherous
18th green for the same number, and that lopped off 15 other
players, including Tom Watson, Corey Pavin and Hale Irwin, all at
148. An even 60 players made the cut, the USGA standard.
Now a winner of the British Open, he has been knocking on the
door of this championship for four years, but nobody answered. He
began this round as hot as a Savannah summer. Chipped to three feet
on the first hole, to three feet on the second, and put his tee
shot 10 feet from the pin on the third. He missed the next three
fairways. Three birdies followed by three bogeys.
Gradually during the Pacific afternoon, red figures dropped from
the leaderboard. Matt Kuchar, the kid with the fetching smile,
disappeared completely in the jaws of a 76. Lehman and Bob Tway,
who formed his game at Atlanta Country Club, were left to chase
Payne Stewart, who has now been out front at each sundown.
