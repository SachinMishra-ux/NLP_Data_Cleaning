Righthander Bob Scanlan was ready to enter the game, but Dierker
opted for Magnante, who got a weak ground ball from Larkin and
struck out switch-hitting Dmitri Young to end the game.
With Wagner around, save opportunities are rare for other
members of the Astros' bullpen. Wagner has 18 of the team's 23
saves, and Magnante isn't ready to replace his good buddy as the
closer.
Albeit mild, Schourek was under pressure to perform in light of
Scott Elarton's solid debut. If Elarton continues to pitch well,
the Astros might want to find a spot in the rotation for him, and
Schourek has been the most inconsistent starter on the staff. In
his previous outing, a 9-4 loss to St. Louis, Schourek lasted just
three innings (six runs, five hits and a career-high seven walks).
Although Schourek pitched for the Reds the past four seasons, he
said he took no special pleasure in beating his former teammates.
Sunday's game was a battle of Pistol Petes Houston's Schourek
and Cincinnati's Harnisch, who also was working against his former
team.
Harnisch shot himself in the foot in the third inning when he
hit Craig Biggio and put himself in position to face the heart of
the Astros' order with one out. Biggio moved to second on a single
by Bill Spiers and scored on Jeff Bagwell's base hit to left.
Schourek, who threw a season-high 116 pitches, retired 12 of the
first 20 batters he faced before the Reds got something going in
the sixth inning. Young doubled and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Sean Casey.
That proved to be the only run for the Reds, who left 12 men on
base and never collected more than one hit in any inning.
Things began to fall apart in the sixth for Harnisch, who
allowed the first three batters to reach base. Bagwell and Moises
Alou singled, and Carl Everett drew a walk to load the bases for
Tony Eusebio.
Harnisch got Eusebio to hit into a double play, but Bagwell was
able to score for a 2-1 lead. Ricky Gutierrez singled home Alou.
