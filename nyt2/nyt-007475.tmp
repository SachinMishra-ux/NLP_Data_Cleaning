Consider how it will fit into the rest of your wardrobe. And
don't be afraid to be adventurous. You can't go too far wrong.
When the pool at Hampton Commons in Hampton Township, N.J.,
opened last month, residents of the 300-unit condominium
association were reminded that only unit owners whose maintenance
charges were current would be admitted. Bathers in arrears, the
board noted, could be fined $25.
Hampton Commons appears to be on the leading edge of a trend in
community relations providing residents with information and
interaction over the Internet as a supplement to the more
traditional ways of communicating with them.
Increasingly, boards are discovering that what the Community
Associations Institute Web site does for its members, individual
buildings can do on a smaller scale for their unit owners.
Hampton Commons, for example, posts on its Web site the minutes
of every board meeting, reports prepared by committees and notices
that range from who may use the pool to when shrubs displaced by
sewer line work will be replaced.
In addition, the board also posts bylaws, rules and regulations
and other information relating to the finances of the association.
And, like most Web sites, the Hampton Commons site also provides
links to other Web sites like local schools, governmental agencies
and, of course, the Community Associations Institute which, in
turn, provides links to hundreds of other related sites.
While establishing a presence on the Internet is neither
technically difficult nor excessively costly, there are at least
two issues that must be addressed by any co-op or condominium board
contemplating such a project.
At Hampton Commons, for example, a computer-savvy resident,
Bonnie Venable, volunteered her time and expertise to construct the
association's site and keep it current.
And for co-ops and condominiums in New York, the Council of New
York Cooperatives recently began providing member buildings with
the ability to establish a professionally designed site at minimal
cost.
Lloyd Chrein, president of Chrein.com, the company that designed
the council's Internet site, said that buildings that sign up for
CNYCSites will have a site designed for them that will be linked
directly with the council's existing site.
