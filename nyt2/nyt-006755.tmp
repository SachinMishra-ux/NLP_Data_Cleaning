Joe Carter was standing behind home plate at Baltimore's Camden
Yards last month, sermonizing about his bat. Carter, nearly
reverential, told how it was more durable, how it allowed him to
whip through the strike zone faster and how other major-leaguers
will ultimately want one.
Carter, bat evangelist as well as a member of the Orioles, at
last persuaded Pat Borders of the Cleveland Indians formerly his
teammate in Toronto to take a swing. Borders swung the bat once,
twice, three times and then nodded his acceptance. Carter cackled
with knowing approval, then shared his wisdom.
What is the secret? Why does Carter, a potential Hall of Famer
who has knocked in at least 100 runs in 11 of his 16 seasons, adore
a bat that he did not begin using until last season while with the
Blue Jays, a bat he sneaked into at least one game in 1997 before
it was officially approved by major-league baseball?
Carter is the most vocal of the two dozen major-league clients
of Sam Holman, a waggish 53-year-old from Ottawa who responded to a
bar challenge from a baseball scout two years ago by carving a bat
from rock maple wood, not the northern ash wood from which
virtually all bats are made.
So Holman formed Original Maple Bat Corp. and has devoted the
last two years to making maple bats and trying to gain a slice of a
market dominated by Hillerich Bradsby, a 115-year-old Louisville,
Ky., company that provides Louisville Sluggers to almost 70 percent
of major-league players. Trying to break into a sport steeped in
tradition and superstition, Holman has a daunting task.
Still, Holman tells players that maple bats, denser and
stronger, can last a full month. Ash bats last from a day to a
week, rarely survive a month and must be discarded anyway because
the barrels become dented. The maple bats are sleeker because they
have tighter grains, a smoother finish and a thinner barrel,
usually measuring 2\ inches instead of 2{.
Although thinner barrels can frighten hitters less bat surface
with which to make contact Holman stressed that bat speed will
increase. Holman, who calls his products Sam Bats, said that they
traveled through the strike zone faster because they were lighter,
and that contact with a ball was made on a harder surface.
Holman is one of about 20 smaller manufacturers who provide bats
for players, but he is the only one using maple. Bill Williams, a
spokesman for HB, said the company has experimented with all types
of wood and even made some maple bats for Little Leaguers in the
early 1990s, but has no plans to switch from ash. Ash, he said, is
the best for duplicating the thin handles and thick barrels most
major-leaguers became accustomed to through years of using aluminum
bats in Little League, high school and college.
Nonetheless, why did it take decades for someone to consistently
use maple to make bats? It is not Kryptonite, after all.
Carter, who was batting .266 with nine home runs and 26 runs
batted in going into last night's game, is Holman's most loyal
client on a gradually growing list that includes Toronto's Jose
Canseco, Baltimore's Mike Bordick and Houston's Brad Ausmus. Holman
has filled orders for Colorado's Larry Walker and Houston's Craig
Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, and dozens of other players have sampled
the maple bats but have been hesitant to switch.
