NEW YORK Sometime in 1993 memories are hazy and nothing was
written down for the public the North American Air Defense
Command in Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., conducted a test to see what
would happen to all their computers the ones that warn of a
nuclear attack on New Year's Day of the Year 2000.
The Y2K problem is now a well-known bug the one demon in the
bag of popular millennial nightmares that is based not on
Nostradamus or other mythic apocrypha, but on hard science.
Every federal agency, bank, and major corporation has teams
devoting thousands of manhours to solving the problem in the next
18 months, before the deadline inexorably strikes.
But the military may be the hardest hit, because the
consequences could affect not just paychecks and power grids, but
war and peace.
Pentagon officials are hopeful that they will fix at least all
the critical systems in time, but they admit it will be a close
call, at best.
According to the Pentagon, only four countries the United
States, Britain, Canada, and Australia are doing anything to
prepare their military computers for 2000.
Hamre said the situation is so grim that the Pentagon is
developing a program to share data from US early-warning satellites
with other countries, including Russia and China. Otherwise, come
2000, such nations may find themselves in the dark, uncertain
whether an attack is coming or not which, in a crisis, could
provoke great anxiety.
Blair, who has interviewed several Russian nuclear officers,
said Russia faces particularly dire straits. Since its army has
collapsed, it is relying far more on its nuclear weapons for
security. And, because of shortages in manpower and money, its
nuclear weapons are becoming increasingly vulnerable and its
early-warning network more riddled with gaps.
That meeting resulted in a directive, sent to every relevant
office in the Defense Department, to address Y2K as a top priority.
By the end of next year, $1.9 billion will have been shifted from
various weapons programs to prepare for 2000.
First, the commercial computer industry might not be able to
supply the large quantity of hardware the communications hubs,
routers, and servers needed to make the fixes.
