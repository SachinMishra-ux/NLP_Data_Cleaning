In addition to making a final run with the International Race of
Champions all-stars in late July, Kendall will drive Team SABCO's
No. 46 First Union Chevy Monte Carlo on NASCAR Winston Cup road
courses at Sears Point (June 28) and Watkins Glen, N.Y. (Aug. 9).
Kendall, long one of the stars of American road racing, gets a
call almost every year from one Winston Cup team or another looking
for a driver for the tour's two road-course stops.
When not racing, Kendall can be found doing commentary at
various races. He will be in Portland, Ore., this weekend, decked
out with a microphone and headset for ESPN's coverage of the FedEx
Championship Series Budweiser-G.I. Joe 200.
Nuts and bolts: Wally Dallenbach will take over behind the wheel
of the No. 50 Budweiser Winston Cup car for Sunday's Pocono 500.
Dallenbach, fired earlier this year by Team SABCO, takes over
relief duty for Ricky Craven, who is recuperating from
post-concussion syndrome. . . . Mojave Desert Racing, Inc. will
hold the third of its five race weekends today, Saturday and
Sunday. The event's being called the Kar Tek Off Road California
200, in Lucerne Valley. Information: (626) 442-9320. 
Yet there was Payne Stewart, basket full and face awash in an
impish grin, trying to calculate the odds against repeating the
birdie-birdie-birdie finish that propelled him into the first-round
lead at the U.S. Open.
By closing with three consecutive birdies, Stewart finished with
a 4-under-par 66 and took a one-stroke lead over Mark Carnevale on
a day with the par-70 layout played to an average score of 75.
Well-tucked pins, firm fairways, tiny greens and thick rough
tinged with a heavy morning dew helped make scoring conditions
difficult for the 156 starters. Stewart was among nine players who
finished yesterday with under-par scores.
Others included Tom Lehman, Bob Tway and Jose Maria Olazabal,
all at 68. Joe Durant, John Daly, Jesper Parnevik and Jeff Maggert,
a Houston resident and Texas AM graduate, are at 69.
Several notables struggled, however. Past major-championship
winners Ben Crenshaw (82), Hale Irwin (80), Davis Love III (78),
Nick Faldo (77), Curtis Strange (77) and Corey Pavin (76) all find
themselves at least 10 strokes in back of Stewart.
But the well-hidden pins could not stop Stewart, who collected
five birdies and one bogey. He also drained two par putts from
beyond 12 feet in matching his best career start at the Open. In
1991, when Stewart won the title, he opened with a 67.
