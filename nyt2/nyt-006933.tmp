About 6,000 of the Palestinians who work on the farms in the
valley are seasonal laborers who live in villages near Nablus.
These are in Area B under Oslo's classification, meaning that they
come under Palestinian civilian jurisdiction.
The effect of these measures is the steady migration of
Palestinians westwards from the valley to urban areas such as East
Jerusalem and Nablus.
It is precisely this eventuality that Netanyahu is preparing
against. (To publish this 625-word article, it must be purchased the rate

 By DALE ROBERTSON c. 1998, Houston Chronicle HOUSTON Unfortunately, Mark McGwire doesn't care for the
attention. He'd prefer to hit his home runs surrounded by peace and
quiet. He'd swap the batter's box for a vacuum chamber any day.
Not an option, though, is it? The world is fast becoming his
fish bowl. The press corps' full-court press is only now starting,
and as the McDinger count mounts, which seems as inevitable as a
new record for times being intentionally walked, the questions will
increase at the same pace. And they'll probably get even dumber
than he already thinks they are.
Each night this week, McGwire's pre-game blasts have traveled
farther and farther. One among many Thursday landed three rows
beneath the upper-deck scoreboard in the Astrodome. Impressive
stuff that, the kind of stuff you're going to tell your
grandchildren about someday.
But more impressive was what he did for real. His 33rd home run
in his 63rd game, coming in the fifth inning at the expense of an
already beaten-down Shane Reynolds, traveled almost that far 449
feet, according to the boys in the computer room. It also lowered
his 1998 ratio of homers to at-bats to one of the former for every
6.6 of the latter.
How good is that? His career ratio is already the best ever,
1-to-11.54, ahead of Babe Ruth's 1-to-11.76. Were he to continue at
such a preposterous pace, which would be flat-out impossible except
for the fact that he already has kept it going deep into June,
he'll hit 80 home runs by the end of the season.
What McGwire himself will talk about in the interim remains to
be seen, but it's likely to have a surly, argumentative tone. If
he's feeling good as he goes about trying to destroy sport's most
famous record, he's not showing it during his post-game rap
sessions with his friends in the media.
He claims to see no reason for the fuss, that it's way too early
to get breathless, never mind that he already has set the
major-league record for the most homers by the end of June, with 11
June dates left for the Cardinals.
