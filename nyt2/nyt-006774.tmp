City officials said Giuliani has been a driving force behind New
York's heightened preparations. The officials said the city's
planned $15 million crisis control center was described by these
officials as a part of the city's emerging defenses.
The city plans to have the ventilation system of the crisis
management center near the World Trade Center adopt a defensive
strategy known as positive pressure, experts say. This precaution
keeps a gentle breeze blowing outward whenever a door or window is
opened, automatically helping to keep out dangerous germs or
chemicals.
The city's defenses are being organized by the Office of
Emergency Management. Hauer is also a member of a small group of
scientists and public health officials who have been advising
President Clinton on germ warfare and civil defense.
Until now, Hauer and other local officials have declined to be
specific about the city's preparations. Some of the steps being
taken and their motivation were outlined Tuesday by William Nagle,
a deputy director of the Office of Emergency Planning, at a
conference in Washington, which was sponsored by the Potomac
Institute for Policy Studies.
The 4,000 members of the city's police and fire units who have
undergone military instruction of a day or more in how to deal with
germ and chemical attacks, he said, have been taught to fight their
instincts in such an emergency.
Hauer, the office's director, said the city had spent more than
$1 million to buy two mobile emergency trailers filled with
containment vessels of different sizes that can isolate dangerous
germs or chemicals, as well as equipment to respond to an attack.
It has bought several hundred portable detectors to help
identify the exact nature of an infectious strike within as little
as 10 minutes. One type is as small as a matchbook; the other,
known as an immunoassay, is a boxy gadget that uses an antibody to
detect the presence of a dangerous germ. New York is the first city
to acquire the latter, Hauer said.
The federal government is sponsoring five meetings in which New
York and other officials play out what would happen if the city
were attacked with biological weapons. From these exercises,
federal officials plan to glean lessons which are meant to be
applied nationwide, making New York a model.
In the first of these meetings last April, more than 50
scientists, government officials and state and local emergency
preparedness teams met in secret on the outskirts of Washington
D.C.
They were confronted with a chilling scenario: More than a
thousand people in a 15-story office building in mid-town Manhattan
were attacked by a germ disseminated through the unfiltered air
ducts.
