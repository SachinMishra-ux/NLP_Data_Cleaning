The AP's closing has led some elderly White Plains residents to
urge city officials to lure another supermarket to buy the space.
The AP has put its building up for sale, though store officials
declined to reveal the asking price. George Gretsas, the executive
officer of White Plains, said that the asking price was $4 million,
far more than the $1.5 million that the city's assessors had
estimated the building was worth and too inflated a price for
another supermarket.
Before the AP closed, a CVS drug store, a Woolworth's, a bank
and a couple of delicatessens, all within four blocks of one
another, had closed during the past year. Macy's led off the
downtown's decline two years ago, when it shut its Main Street
store after 47 years and moved into the nearby Galleria Mall.
Some of the stores closed to make way for a 24-screen movie
theater and retail complex that is supposed to be the centerpiece
of a plan to revitalize downtown White Plains. That complex does
not include a supermarket, however.
Politicians and store owners have scrambled to insure that no
one is left without access to food. The AP began a free shuttle
bus from its closed store to the Food Emporium, which it also owns,
twice a week from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., said Andrew Carrano, AP's
vice president for marketing and corporate affairs.
In addition, Stop and Shop, another supermarket, is running a
shuttle twice a week along North Broadway, White Plains' leafy
version of the Grand Concourse. It takes customers to the store in
North White Plains, where the bus will wait for an hour before the
return trip, Mayor Joseph Delfino said in a letter he sent to 3,500
residents of the downtown neighborhood.
NEW YORK Larry Douglas, if that really was his name, had been
a fixture in local politics for years. But at his funeral last
week, only about two dozen people showed up to pay their respects.
And some of them joked that they went just to make sure he was
really dead.
Not out of malice, but because Douglas had a penchant for
telling tall tales, especially of the political sort. While he had
developed a reputation as a brilliant political consultant in the
1980s, he also became widely known as someone who had a lot of
trouble sticking to the truth.
He had been involved in mayoral and presidential elections and
was described by friends as an eloquent and well-connected
political analyst. But he also had a habit of disappearing for
years at a time once, his friends said, he fled to Israel to
avoid federal tax-evasion charges.
When he died on June 12 at Coney Island Hospital, he had been
living under an assumed name, Zachary Phillips, in a tiny apartment
in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, for nearly two years. Most of the
people he had clinked glasses with at political gatherings and
plotted campaign strategies with did not even know he was in the
city.
