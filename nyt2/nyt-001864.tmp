The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.
Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrinos constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere and they have calculated that the
ratio between muon neutrinos and other flavors must have a certain
value. But over the years detectors found only about half the muon
neutrino predicted by theory.
The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos come from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector a relatively short distance the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to oscillate, probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
A related problem has to do with neutrinos produced by the
fusion process in the sun. This process, which merges the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and energy, produces
neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand the mechanism in
complete detail.
The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
Scientists believe the anomaly can be explained by the
oscillation of detectable solar neutrinos into types that cannot be
detected by existing instruments. But no one has proven this
explanation.
The leader of the collaboration's University of Hawaii Group,
for example, Dr. John Learned, has also worked on an underwater
detection system in the Pacific Ocean off the Hawaiian coast (which
ran out of money before completion) and a project at the South Pole
where a neutrino detector had been buried under thousands of feet
of ice.
Another approach to penetrating the neutrino secrets involves
the use of particle accelerators capable of producing intense beams
of neutrinos. In two experiments currently being prepared, one in
Japan and the other at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in
Illinois, beams of neutrinos will be directed through the Earth
toward detectors several hundred miles away. The goal will be to
observe changes the neutrinos undergo in transit, both in numbers
and types. Physicists expect the experiment to confirm the
existence of neutrino oscillations like those seen in the
Super-Kamiokande detector.
Although the neutrinos are now known to have some mass, most
physicists agree that the mass must be very small. The
Super-Kamiokande experiments suggest that the difference between
the masses of muon neutrinos and other types of neutrinos is only
about 0.07 electron volts (a measure of particle mass). This does
not yield a value of the masses themselves, only of the difference
between those of muon neutrinos and other types.
