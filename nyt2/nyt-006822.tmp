The city is buying germ detectors, working out deals with
regional hospitals for emergency care, striking unusual accords
with drug companies to make medicines quickly in an emergency and
taking steps to stockpile medications, officials say.
Although no specific threat of a germ or chemical attack has
been detected recently, the city has undertaken an extensive
training program since September, instructing about 4,000 city
police officers and firefighters in how to handle such an
emergency. Next week, about 1,500 doctors and nurses in New York
are to be trained by outside medical experts.
Emergency planners face bewildering problems in preparing to
deal with germ attacks, the foremost being how to tell if sudden
outbreaks of illness are natural or purposeful. Malicious strikes
are hard to detect rapidly since deadly microbes might incubate in
human bodies for hours, days, weeks or even months before causing
widespread havoc.
Dealing with waves of sick or dying victims is a planner's
nightmare, as is cleaning up contaminated areas and buildings. The
spores of anthrax, one of the most common biological warfare
agents, can live for centuries.
Two months ago, city officials began monitoring patterns of
emergency hospitalization so that they can more swiftly determine
if unconventional weapons are used to attack New York. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, officials say, has asked to be personally
informed of any suspicious patterns of illness.
Experts agree that skillful terrorists in theory could injure or
kill thousands, if not millions, of people, but disagree on the
exact dimensions of the threat. Too little is known of that shadowy
underworld, they say.
Federal and local officials have become increasingly worried in
recent years about the possibility of germ and chemical attacks.
Nationally, the worries stem from American intelligence reports
about terrorists planning attacks and such incidents as a religious
cult's assaults on Tokyo with nerve gas and germs.
Locally, the danger from terrorists was driven home in 1993,
when a terrorist bomb planted by Islamic militants exploded under
the World Trade Center, killing six people and injuring 1,000.
Congress has provided about $100 million to support the training
of local officials nationwide to cope with unconventional terrorist
attacks. But the Pentagon said only 27 of the 120 cities in that
program had received assistance so far. And many have yet to
receive equipment.
