The tobacco contributions in Florida have become an issue in the
coming gubernatorial contest between the likely Democratic
candidate, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, and the likely Republican
candidate, Jeb Bush. Bush's campaign has called MacKay a hypocrite
for portraying himself as an anti-tobacco crusader who eschews
tobacco donations, while the state's Democratic Party took in
$25,000 in 1998 from tobacco interests. Republicans received
$42,000 from tobacco interests.
While the state lawsuits have been an important concern, there
are other issues at the state level that are critical to tobacco,
including excise taxes and local anti-smoking ordinances. But some
recipients of tobacco industry money said the contributions were
not tied to particular issues.
Some industries contribute to the state parties because their
donations are sometimes controversial and state-level donations are
less noticed than federal contributions. Gambling and alcohol
interests also contributed heavily to the state parties. In 1996,
the Democratic National Committee directed several tobacco and
gaming companies to make their donations to state Democratic
parties instead of to the Democratic National Committee.
Also, with prospects clouded for federal legislation to enact
the historic settlement reached last year between the cigarette
makers and the states, the pro-tobacco forces may need their allies
at the state level more than ever.
CHICAGO As the Chicago Bulls play the Utah Jazz in the NBA
Finals, a series that some speculate may be Michael Jordan's Last
Games, Last Dance, Last Stand (would one of Jordan's last meals
then be the Last Repast?), it would be helpful to consider the
circumstances surrounding the possible grounding of His Airness.
To many, the Bulls' coach, Phil Jackson, is the key to Jordan's
basketball-playing future. And by extension, the Bulls' management
has been perceived as that which holds the hand that holds the key.
The 35-year-old Jordan has said, and then seemingly hedged, that
he would not return to the Bulls the only team he said he would
consider playing for if Jackson was not the coach. Jackson was
the bench leader behind all the Bulls' five championships.
Jordan has coyly left the impression that he may not go
voluntarily into that good night, and that the Bulls' management,
like the proprietor of a vaudeville stage, might just be applying a
hook, although circumspectly. That is, no Jackson, no Jordan.
Jordan is not alone in this intimation. Phil Jackson has indirectly
also allowed the idea to spread.
Jackson has repeatedly stated publicly that this would be his
last season. And why would this be Jackson's last season? Because,
it is generally believed, Bulls management wants it that way, and
is pushing Jackson out.
Last summer, Jackson indeed signed a one-year contract but he
had been offered a five-year contract, then a two-year contract,
and turned them down for the one-year deal.
