In this dizzying paganistic ode to Eros, where the camera almost
never stops moving, the angel sharks have been replaced by the
bodies of restless, hot-blooded adolescents diving and treading
water and nipping on each other in the shadowy depths. The
comparison is made explicit in a scene in which a pubescent swimmer
with an angelic halo of blond hair is shot and the water slowly
turns deep red.
At the center of the film whose cast largely consists of
nonactors gleaned from French stadiums, beaches, Gypsy camps and
housing projects is a brooding, sensual 15-year-old girl named
Marie (Vahina Giocante) who runs wild one summer. Marie snubs the
impoverished local boys in favor of a group of arrogant American
sailors who take her to nightclubs and hotels. Then having had
their way with her, they discard her with brutal contempt, calling
her a Gypsy whore. Marie ends up sharing a brief idyll with Orso
(Frederic Malgras), a rootless, pug-faced petty criminal who robs
houses and hangs around with the local youth gangs.
These scenes give you the feeling that gang rape and gang war
are almost the same thing and that given the right circumstances
they are inevitable eruptions of male aggression.
After a while, the images of water, rocks and half-naked bodies
merge into a vision of the film's characters as untamed forces of
nature who are the fauna of the environment in which they cavort.
Viewed this way, you begin to stop thinking of them as civilized
humans bound to any social or moral order, even when they commit
crimes.

For some years, the policy has been no secret to the dictators
or those Americans who bother to pay attention. The results have
been productive, no denying that. 
For China it produced U.S. satellite technology to sharpen the
aim of its missiles, for North Korea a growing trade in the export
of missiles and for Iraq a free hand to slaughter all Iraqis who
oppose Saddam Hussein and a plan to end sanctions and start again
to rebuild its military power. For America it also produced
something: a trash can full of broken promises. 
But Wednesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright added a
high shine to Clintonian appeasement policy by including under its
sheltering arms the government of Iran. Yes, indeed, the Iran that
executed thousands of its own citizens, held 53 Americans hostage
for 444 days in the U.S. Embassy, the same Iran that boasts of its
infiltration of Bosnia, that killed Jews in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, and almost daily sends to Damascus a planeload of
weapons and funds for terrorists around the world. 
The Clintonian rationalization will be that the choreographed
overture to Iran is support for Iranians who voted for Khatami. In
truth, it will strengthen their tormentors, make it more difficult
to overthrow them. 
By pretending that the Iranian regime that lives by terrorism
might end it, by absolving countries pouring money into the
government and therefore its killers and floggers, the U.S.
announces it will not try to punish or even hamper the regime, and
despite the past, would help it.
