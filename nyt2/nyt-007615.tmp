Norwood is referring to what would happen to the bill if he took
it to the House floor and won. The bill would have to pass the
Senate. If it passed the Senate, the next step would be for it to
go to a committee conference , where he predicted that the
Republican leaders would massage it and change it to their liking.
And all of that is subject to the co-sponsors keeping their
names on the list of co-sponsors. With the Republican leaders
standing in firm opposition to the bill, several Republicans said
they would hesitate to continue their support of the measure.
Still, Norwood is confident that he will prevail on important
parts of his bill. And he has support from groups representing
patients and healthcare providers, which have long argued that
Congress should intervene to iron out managed care problems.
Republicans on the task force said that bill that emerges would
most likely include the following:
 Gag Rule: a provision in the bill giving doctors in managed
care plans the authority to outline all of the options available to
patients, despite the cost.
 Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has
been the most controversial element in the debate over whether to
impose federal regulations on managed care companies. Norwood
argues that the ERISA law unfairly offers employers liability
protection from the consequences of the healthcare decisions they
make that cause death or injury. Under ERISA, employees can sue
their health insurer if they believe that they have made a wrong
decision, but they are barred from obtaining punitive and
compensatory damages.
About 125 million workers, dependents and retirees are covered
by plans subject to ERISA, according to the Labor Department.
Norwood argues that removing the bar on punitive and compensatory
damages in ERISA would force health plans to be accountable for the
decisions they make, thus improving the overall quality of
healthcare.
PHOENIX Lynn Adler, an advocate for the aging who enjoys the
company of people who have made it to their 100th birthdays, gave a
party recently for her centenarian friends. Nine of them showed up.
Obviously, only a small number of people will live to be 100 one in 10,000 Americans and among those who do reach the century
mark, the rate of disability is high. The nine centenarians at Lynn
Adler's party, the ones who get on television and are held up as
role models, are the exceptions.
But centenarians are proportionately the United States'
fastest-growing age group, with projections that by the middle of
the next century, more than 800,000 Americans will be over 100. And
so many are making it to 100 in relatively good health, as life
expectancies in general shoot up, that centenarians, once
sentimentalized rarities, have become a symbol of the country's age
boom and a metaphor for the dramatic shift in attitude about what
old means.
