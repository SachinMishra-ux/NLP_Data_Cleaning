YBORFLA TAMPA I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago
when Ybor was a crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night
neighborhood. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
YBORFLA-WALKINGTOUR TAMPA Carmen Morales, who grew up in
Ybor City, can bring the past back with anecdotes that make a
1-mile walking tour a lively excursion. A volunteer guide, she'll
tell you about her history, which is Ybor's history, too.

SEASIDE SEASIDE, Fla. This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years the first house was built in 1981 counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE SEASIDE, Fla. So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf
of Mexico would be the main attraction. No, indeed. Houses are what
draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT SUWANNEE, Fla. I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

MODERNDESIGNS HIGH POINT, N.C. Modern designs, with clean,
simple lines, lighter woods and streamlined shapes, are headed to
furniture showrooms this fall. Among the designers leading the way
is Larry Laslo, one of the country's top creators of contemporary
furnishings, who introduced The Moderne Collection a
French-influenced Deco/Cubist/Modernist line for Bexley Heath
Ltd. at the spring High Point show. (Flanders, Atlanta

the National Black Arts Festival (July 10-19) has become one of the
foremost events of its kind. An event this large has substantial
volunteer needs, from ushers and office help to people to greet
artists at the airport and help them around Atlanta. (Henry,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)ETA 8 p.m. ET.
