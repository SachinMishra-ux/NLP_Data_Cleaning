It wasn't so long ago that Hingis was just a 14-year-old
Wimbledon wannabe who took one horrified look at the identity of
her first-round opponent in 1995, the top-ranked Graf, and decided
that maybe she didn't really want to go to Wimbledon after all.
Back then, Graf practically held the mortgage on Wimbledon and
every other Grand Slam. Not anymore. Hingis, a first-round victim
to the Graf in 1995, grew up and grew bold.
And now nobody is intimidated by anybody and everybody is using
vengeance as a motivator. The old ones want to teach the young ones
a lesson, and the young ones want to vanquish the old ones. Every
player wants what Hingis has: the self-esteem that accompanies this
Wimbledon trophy. 
SHANGHAI, China Rebuffing international pressure to
compromise, Chinese authorities instead chose to escalate their
dispute with the director of a classic Chinese opera that is
scheduled to open in New York City next month as the centerpiece of
the Lincoln Center Festival.
The authorities, insisting that the world see a version that
Chinese officials are used to, have required extensive revisions to
the opera's script. Last week, they blocked shipment of the
production's sets, props and costumes, now all stuck at Shanghai
International Airport. They defended that move by saying the items
will be needed as the opera is revised.
Raymond Burghardt, U.S. consul general in Shanghai, said he had
urged the Shanghai authorities to allow the production's shipment
to proceed to New York on Sunday, and expressed the hope that the
dispute could be resolved in time for the opening on July 7.
Chen, saying he was distressed by the thought that the
production might be foiled, stressed that he was willing to make
minor adjustments to his production in order to compromise with the
authorities. But he is not willing to completely restage the show,
as the officials are now demanding.
In principle, the Shanghai Bureau of Culture might have little
say over a production to be staged in the United States, and funded
by the Lincoln Center Festival.
In practice, Communist Party bureaucrats have wielded decisive
control over artistic matters for years and are reluctant to give
it up. Many movie directors, authors and actors in China know about
interference by officials at the Ministry of Culture, still a
redoubt of ultraconservative officials.
Chen, a native of China who moved to the United States in 1987,
said he was warned by friends that the typical method of staging a
show in China includes inviting political leaders to a rehearsal
and making whatever changes they ask for, large or small, even if
the politicians understand nothing of opera.
