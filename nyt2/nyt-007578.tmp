TAX-REFORM (Topeka, Kan.) The new way that taxes are collected
in this Midwest state capital may offer taxpayers everywhere a
glimpse of what the future may be like in dealing with the Internal
Revenue Service. By David Cay Johnston.
WASHINGTON By setting aside tobacco legislation that would
have increased costs for smokers, the Senate cleared the way last
week to consider a bill that will raise the ante for people whose
debts are driving them into bankruptcy.
Unlike the tobacco debate, which barely touched on smokers'
responsibility for their habits, the debate over tightening
bankruptcy rules is likely to focus on consumers' responsibility
for paying their bills.
Gramm and other reform-minded lawmakers are reacting to
bankruptcy filings that have hit highs not seen since the collapse
of the real estate market and savings loans in the last half of
the 1980s. With no similar economic crisis to explain the current
spike in bankruptcy filings, some lawmakers are pointing their
fingers at the debtors.
Consumer advocates, in turn, are pointing fingers at banks and
retailers that are marketing credit cards at unprecedented rates.
University of Texas law professor Jay Westbrook, a bankruptcy law
specialist, prepared for a recent speech in Austin by collecting
eight days' worth of credit offers that he and his wife received in
the mail. The total hit $600,000.
Despite the professors' concern, Congress has moved at
uncharacteristic speed to change the rules governing the levels of
relief available to people with crushing debts. The House approved
its package of changes June 10 in a 306-118 vote.
The Senate is expected to take up its version of bankruptcy
reform in mid-July, after a 2 1/2 week recess for the July 4
holiday.
The main goal of both the House and Senate bills is to restrict
debtors' use of a section of the U.S. bankruptcy code known as
Chapter 7, under which individuals and married couples declare an
inability to pay debts and effectively have most of them canceled,
or discharged.
Some personal debts such as income taxes, child support,
alimony, student loans and court judgments for fraud or injury to
another person are considered priority debts and must be paid in
full under both Chapter 7 and its alternative, Chapter 13.
Under Chapter 13, individuals and couples reorganize their debts
and repay part of them under a plan approved by the bankruptcy
court. Chapter 13 is the personal version of Chapter 11, which is
used by corporations to reorganize debt.
