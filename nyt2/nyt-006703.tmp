Although Kivrikoglu has kept a low public profile and declines
requests for interviews, officers who know him and commentators who
monitor the army believe that he will seek to curb the military's
political role. Some speculate that he will transfer senior
officers who have directed the anti-fundamentalist campaign and
will abolish the West Working Group, a military intelligence unit
that closely monitors Islamic trends in society.
The final decision about changes in the military command will be
made at the end of August by the Supreme Military Council, a panel
composed of top military and civilian leaders and headed by Yilmaz.
Military commanders have become impatient with Yilmaz for his
failure to press harder against fundamentalism, a policy he has
adopted partly because he does not want to alienate
Islamic-oriented voters. Kivrikoglu is considered not only less
insistently anti-fundamentalist but also more positive toward
Yilmaz.
The accord this week calling for national elections in April
reflected the weakness of the Yilmaz government, which does not
have a majority in Parliament and must therefore cater to a variety
of factional leaders.
The government is so divided that its second-ranking figure,
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, said he had not signed the
accord and was not certain there would actually be elections in
April.
As bickering among civilian leaders continued this week, the
military-directed campaign against fundamentalism continued. On
Monday, police officers used tear gas and batons to break up a
demonstration of about 1,000 Muslims who were protesting a new ban
on the wearing of head scarves by female university students. The
banned students and their supporters held more protests later in
the week.
It is now back at the Lamb's, in the main theater, with a cast
whose members fill the auditorium not only with song but also with
the sounds of piano, bass, fiddle, guitar, banjo, harp, accordion,
harmonica, cymbals, bells, washboards, wooden spoons and slats, and
even a half-filled soda bottle (great train whistle), most of them
moving from one instrument to another without missing a beat.
The story is a deceptively simple comedy about a service in a
Baptist church in rural white North Carolina 60 years ago, a place
and time beautifully evoked by Peter Harrison's set. The minister
(Robert Olsen) struggles to keep control of the proceedings, but
the choir takes over. The choir is the singing Sanders family: the
quiet operator of a general store and gas station (Bobby Taylor);
his bright and slightly dotty wife (Constance Barron); his brother
(John Griffith), who is sullen but softhearted, and three children:
an awkward but very smart daughter who is the only songless Sanders
(Jonah Marsh) and younger twins (Dionne McGuire Gardner and Sean
Dooley) who give the impression that if their leashes were cut they
would steal the whole show.
For all their sly, Bible-quoting efforts to manipulate one
another, these characters share a deep affection, and the actors so
clearly relish inhabiting the characters that the performance
becomes a delightfully engaging revelation of the rich complexity,
and downright orneriness, of simple people whose faith is powerful
but far from unquestioning. The cast is a fine ensemble. They feel
like a warm old-fashioned family, and they know how to make the
audience feel right at home. All that clapping and singing along
seems as natural as breathing.
