To be sure, although Americans would like more, some repairs are
still crucial. One that Japanese officials are focusing on would be
for the banking system, and particularly the bad loans that
overwhelm it.
All this raises puzzling questions about the Japanese political
process. In most industrialized countries there is a built-in
corrective mechanism when an economy veers off course. Disgruntled
voters evict the old team and choose new leaders who promise to do
things differently. Yet despite eight years of economic stagnation
the Japanese political system has not responded in that way.
Certainly Japan does not have the feel of a country in a severe
downturn. There are very few homeless people, soup kitchens,
bankruptcies or vacant buildings. Although there are some
differences in measurements, the record unemployment rate in Japan
is still 4.1 percent, less than the 4.3 rate in the United States.
An old saying defines a recession as when your neighbor is laid
off. When you are laid off it is a depression. By those
definitions, for the great majority of Japanese this is still not a
recession.
The sliding yen had been a visible and humiliating signal of
Japanese economic weakness. But for now the joint U.S.-Japanese
intervention may have arrested the slide. In early Asian trading on
Friday, the yen was quoted at 137.30 to the dollar, compared to 146
before the intervention. The gulf in perceptions inside and outside
Japanese on the seriousness of the economic situation here is
difficult to exaggerate.
To Americans and many Asians these days it sometimes seems that
Japan's economy is burning and is threatening to ignite all of Asia
and, perhaps, the United States and Europe, as well. For those
fearing a global economic conflagration, nothing is more
infuriating than the sight of Hashimoto as he passively watches the
flames and seeming to do little more than blithely insisting that
the fire will eventually subside.
In a similar situation Nero fiddled, but not for eight years that is the kind of grumbling one hears from U.S. officials these
days.
To Japanese officials the foreign carping seems foolish and
petulant. Some say the U.S. government is simply nervous about its
own bubble economy and is looking for a scapegoat to blame when
stock prices inevitably collapse. And most Japanese say the risks
are exaggerated.
Moreover, many Japanese insist that their country is seriously
addressing the recession and the Asian crisis. They note that the
Japanese government has put in place a huge stimulus package, the
biggest in the nation's history, and that the government has
contributed far more to Asian bailouts than the United States.
In any case, for all the bewilderment and anger at Japan's
reluctance to do more to stimulate its economy, in Japan
Hashimoto's behavior makes some sense and appears in keeping with
the public mood. After all, he just celebrated the Liberal
Democratic Party's latest victory, on Sunday in a parliamentary
by-election.
