At the time, Benarroch was living in a condominium at the
Cricket Club in North Miami where the maintenance fees alone cost
$1,000 a month.
Detectives said Benarroch saw no point in paying a premium that
would cover a period after his death: June 20, 1997, the day he
killed himself, was two days before the next premium was due.
Although he wouldn't invest in the death plot, Wyllner told
police he agreed to try to recruit a handful of tennis
acquaintances to listen to Benarroch's offer. But it never came
together with the people they knew at their Fort Lauderdale tennis
club, Wyllner told investigators.
People who heard the sketchy sales pitch assumed it was based on
Benarroch having a fatal disease and concluded it was a scam since
Benarroch seemed too strong on the tennis court to be dying,
Wyllner told police.
Although detectives in Georgia, Palm Beach County and Fort
Lauderdale say they're certain Benarroch found the investors he
needed, no one admitted being one. Two of Benarroch's friends said
Benarroch told them that a man in Venezuela had invested $100,000
in the plan.
Det. Zealous said at least three of the insurance companies paid
the beneficiaries in the months following Benarroch's death.
Because the suicide clauses had expired, the companies had to pay
unless they had another reason to withhold payment, detectives
said.
American General and Prudential confirmed paying a total of $11
million to Benarroch's beneficiaries, but the other companies would
not comment. Zealous said one company contested the validity of the
contract because a premium was either late or unpaid.
Benarroch left $100,000 each to a girlfriend and to a close
female friend he had once dated, and left the rest to his children,
said Fort Lauderdale Det. John King. Benarroch's daughter, Alice
Benarroch, 36, of North Miami, was executor of the will, and her
brother, Alan Benarroch, 34, of Venezuela, was to get money under
the condition that he divorce his wife whom his father disliked,
the detectives said. Neither sibling could be reached for comment
last week.
But before the children could collect, the money went to
Casablanca Investment Corp., a company in Grand Cayman, which their
father organized to handle the estate, King said. Detectives said
they feel certain the children knew nothing of the plan.
Wyllner told investigators Benarroch feared that if he killed La
Bergere himself, he would be arrested and unable to pay his
premiums. After La Bergere died, Benarroch gloated, but never
directly said he killed him or ordered a hit, Wyllner told Wingate.
