Members of the committee openly acknowledge that they do not
meet or vote and that they have no room assigned for their
nonexistent deliberations.
They also make no secret of where the work of the committee is
really being done, or who is doing it. They jokingly refer to the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, as Mr. Rules. And the committee,
they like to say, meets between his ears.
This year there has been a lot of talk here about a new era of
openness, about the democratization of the Capitol, about an
unparalleled shift of power from the legislative leaders to
rank-and-file members. After all, ordinary Joe Six-Pack legislators
were actually allowed to discuss the budget in conference
committees this spring and to offer their suggestions. This,
lawmakers all agreed, was a big improvement over last year, when
they were not even told what was in the budget until negotiations
were safely concluded.
So tight is their control over their respective houses that
practically no vote is taken in either the Assembly or the Senate
in which the outcome has not been determined in advance. On
occasion, a lawmaker may vote against his party, but it is expected
that he will first get permission to do so.
As this session heads toward recess, there are few signs these
habits are changing. Lawmakers say they expect the session, like
those before it, to end in an all-night marathon. They expect bills
that they have never had a chance to read to suddenly pop out of
the Rules Committee. And they fully expect to approve them.
It is a sign of how well established this political culture is
that even members of the Rules Committee largely accept its odd
ontological status as a matter of course, a subject more fit for
humor than outrage or embarrassment.
Winner recalled that a few years ago, there was a push to change
the Assembly rules and force the Rules Committee to meet. Not
surprisingly, the change, sponsored by the minority, was, at the
request of the leadership, smothered by the majority.
NEW YORK The constitutionality of New York State's untested
1995 capital punishment law and what the defense considers a
judge's flawed conduct of the murder trial of Darrel Harris will be
the focus of the condemned man's historic appeal, his chief trial
lawyer and other legal experts said on Sunday.
A day after a jury in Brooklyn sentenced the 40-year-old former
jail guard to die by lethal injection for killing three people in a
botched 1996 robbery at an illegal social club, lawyers for Harris
were already mapping strategy for an appeal to the state's highest
tribunal, the Court of Appeals.
The appeal is likely to take years, experts said, and is
expected to be the crucial test of the state's three-year-old death
penalty law: not only deciding whether it is lawful under the
federal and New York State Constitutions, but also setting a host
of legal standards, from the way judges conduct capital trials to
the propriety of using injections in executions.
