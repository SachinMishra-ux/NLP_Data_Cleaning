On the short but tricky 288-yard seventh, he nearly holed out,
leaving a wedge shot three inches from the cup. Tap-in birdie. On
the 609-yard 16th, he left an iron shot eight inches from the hole.
Another tap-in birdie.
On the 17th, a converted par-5 and Olympic's toughest hole,
Stewart launched a 2-iron out of the rough and onto the green. He
rammed in a 45-foot putt for birdie and wiggled his body in
celebration. On the 347-yard 18th, he curled in a 12-footer for
birdie, again escaping the rough off the tee. Playing
conservatively, he used his driver just three times.
His closest pursuer was another unlikely Open contender,
Carnevale, who shot a bogey-free 67. The stocky 38-year-old golfer
had struggled mightily this season, missing the cut in 10 of 15
events and finishing no higher than 41st at the Phoenix Open.
But he hung with Stewart. Even when the inevitable happened when he realized how much uncharted territory he had covered. He
has one tour victory to his name, the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. Not
exactly a major.
Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA Championship and 1995 British Open,
has forsaken his driver this week, a courageous move for a man
longer off the tee than anyone. He has turned to his 3-wood,
leaving him some 35 to 40 yards shorter than the norm and conceding
long drive stats and bonus money. He's not happy, but he's in
contention.
HONOLULU As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
