As a result, manufacturers have started to reign in headcounts.
Factory payrolls, which grew by more than more than 300,000 in past
two years, shrank for the second month in a row by 26,000.
Indeed, all of the hiring 332,000 jobs last month was by the
dominant service sector which includes everything from Wall Street
and shopping malls to trucking and management consulting firms.
What's fueling the demand for workers, including, increasingly,
the young, inexperienced, and least educated, isn't much of a
mystery: American businesses and households are on a spending spree
that shows few signs of abating and promises to keep the job market
tight for the foreseeable future. Consumers are spending more
freely than ever, as jammed parking lots at the nation's malls and
the latest reports from merchants confirm.
Just this week, Detroit automakers reported May was their best
sales month in a dozen years. On Thursday, big retailers reported a
7.1 percent in May sales following a 10.2 percent gain in April,
the best monthly increase in 10 years.
Americans are also buying houses. April home sales were the
strongest in history. And furniture, hardware, and other items for
the family home are moving briskly. The 9,000-job drop in
construction in May likely reflects the past few months of unusual
weather patterns and comes after builders hired 204,000 workers
between October and April.
There's no sign that households are tapped out. Partly because
of that hot job market, household income is swelling at a rate
that's highly unusual by historical standards, nearly 5 percent a
year. With inflation running close to 1 percent, if that, `a dollar
is worth a dollar' these days.
The other spur to spending is coming from the stock market,
which has quadrupled in value over the last eight years. Half of
all Americans have some stake in the market, and they're the ones
with most of the disposable income. An economic rule of thumb holds
that consumers spend approximately 3 percent of their wealth gains.
That rule seems to be holding now. The personal savings rate has
declined from 6.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the past five years;
that's an indirect measure of the wealth effect $200-plus billion
in extra spending.
Businesses are also spending like there's no tomorrow. Spending
on new equipment and structures has been booming almost since the
beginning of the expansion and shows no signs of slowing.
One reason for all the investment is that high stock prices and
low interest rates make it more affordable.. Equipment orders
suggest that investment spending, while it may have slowed a tad
from its 27 percent annual rate in the first quarter, is still
rising at a double digit rate.
But while there's no evidence yet that domestic demand is
slowing, some drags on growth are already visible. The trade
deficit which shaved 1.5 percentage points off the economic
growth rate in the first quarter is expected to widen from the
after effects of the Asia crisis, which has diminished demand for
American products in Asia and increased the amount of Asian-made
goods bound for the United States.
