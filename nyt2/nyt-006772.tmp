get the home PC ready for the new product. How much more RAM do you

At the same time, his wife, Teresa, was recovering from
open-heart surgery. The bills began mounting, and still are. Harry,
69, has lost his voice and has to scribble what he wants to say on
a notepad.
That chance comes from Habitat for Humanity, which is building
low-cost homes for the Russells and 99 other families this week.
About 6,000 volunteers have been working on the Jimmy Carter Work
Project, which is supposed to wrap things up Friday.
Thursday was the fourth day of construction on the sites in
Houston's Second and Fifth Wards, and several volunteers were
excited at the progress being made.
Another problem encountered by volunteers was loss of work time
Monday due to excessive morning heat and evening thunderstorms.
Shirl said approximately four hours per house, or 400 hours, of
work was lost.
All 100 homes are expected to be completed Friday, after
plumbers and electricians complete their work and volunteers
landscape the lots and finish hanging doors. Starting Saturday and
continuing into next week, volunteers and Habitat staff members
will inspect the houses to make sure all is ready for move-in day,
June 27.
For most of those involved, Friday will be the last day of work
on the project. Houses will be dedicated, and homeowners will get a
peek at what will be their new place to live.
NEW YORK Long viewed as one of the world's most attractive
targets for terrorists, New York City has quietly undertaken an
ambitious effort to counter attacks carried out with deadly
chemicals or germs, according to city officials.
The city is buying germ detectors, working out deals with
regional hospitals for emergency care, striking unusual accords
with drug companies to make medicines quickly in an emergency and
taking steps to stockpile medications, officials say.
Since September, about 4,000 city police officers and
firefighters have undergone training in reacting to germ or
chemical attacks. And next week, about 1,000 doctors in New York
are to be trained by federal experts.
