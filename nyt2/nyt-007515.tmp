When Moore returned from his meeting with Smith on Wednesday
afternoon, a top-level meeting was convened with him, Storin,
Donovan, Mulvoy and Managing Editor/Administration Louisa Williams.
At that point, the decision was made to seek Smith's resignation,
address the staff, and publish a story explaining what had
happened.
But questions about whether Barnicle embellishes his column have
percolated over the years, with matters really heating up in the
early '90s. A primary catalyst was Dershowitz's charge that
Barnicle had manufactured a sexist and boorish quote about him in
1990. When the Harvard law professor went on television at that
time to invite anyone else who'd been similarly treated to step
forward, it unearthed the story of a Dorchester gas station
proprietor who sued for libel over a 1973 column, claiming that
he'd never made a racist statement Barnicle attributed to him. The
case had ended with the Globe paying the plaintiff a total of about
$40,000.
(In the wake of a Globe review of all of Barnicle's columns
since 1996, Storin Saturday expressed confidence in Barnicle's
integrity. (See accompanying story, Page A28)).
But it seems clear that Storin who left the Globe in 1985,
returned in 1992 and became editor in 1993 was concerned about
Barnicle's reputation when questions about Smith's 1995 columns
first came to his attention.
When Assistant Managing Editor Walter V. Robinson, who initially
flagged the possible 1995 Smith fabrications, identified new
concerns earlier this year, it triggered the chain of events that
ended with Smith's stunning departure.
There was also one nagging item from Smith's past when she was
an editorial assistant at the Chicago Sun-Times. According to Globe
Arts Editor Scott Powers, who was then assistant managing editor
for features at the Sun-Times, errors in a Smith review and the
fact that she did not pick up her press tickets generated
suspicions that she did not attend an Elton John concert she wrote
about in 1986. According to Powers, Smith insisted she had attended
the concert, decided to use lawn tickets purchased by a friend, and
produced notes from the event. There was never any proof or finding
that she missed the concert. But the Sun-Times published a
correction about song titles and John's attire and Smith was barred
from writing for several months.
LYON, France Iran's soccer coach carries a green card from the
Great Satan. Jalal Talebi's family has lived in California for
nearly two decades. His youngest son just graduated from Palo Alto
High and is bound for UCLA. His wife has a skin care business and a
vegetarian restaurant near Stanford. Talebi used to coach at a
local junior college. He likes America and Americans.
But all week long, people have been bringing up 1979 to him.
America Held Hostage. Iran, the outlaw state. Revolution, war,
terrorism, embargos, fractured relations between Washington and
Tehran. It all comes back because somebody pulled two balls out of
a bowl last December and matched the US and Iran in a World Cup
soccer match here Sunday.
And yet, for many of Talebi's countrymen back home, it is much
more. Though the two governments have been edging closer to
normalcy, nudged last week by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Uncle Sam is still widely regarded with hatred and
mistrust in Iran.
So an Iranian victory in the Stade Gerland Sunday (it's a night
game here in France) would all but knock the US out of the world's
most important sporting event and be a coup of enormous symbolic
and emotional significance.
