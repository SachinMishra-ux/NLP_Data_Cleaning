Even the 60 percent of people who say the Justice Department
should continue to investigate Microsoft are not necessarily
convinced that the government was justified in bringing a major
antitrust case against the company last month.
The Justice Department has contended that Microsoft has used
unfair practices to defend its monopoly in the market for
personal-computer operating-system software, the program that
controls the basic operations of a computer, and to try to gain an
edge in the new markets of Internet software and commerce.
Public opinion, to be sure, plays no direct role in antitrust
policy. Yet it is inevitably a consideration when bringing a major
case like the suit against Microsoft. Congress controls the Justice
Department's budget, and a big case that is seen as too far out of
step with public opinion could bring pressure from Congress.
So when the Microsoft suit was announced in Washington on May
18, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before a battery of
television cameras.
Public opinion, he added, also sets the limits of government
action. The Justice Department, for example, has not moved to break
up the big software company, as was done with the Bell System in
1984 and as some industry analysts have advocated in the Microsoft
case.
People are split almost evenly on whether the government did the
right thing in filing suit against Microsoft, with 35 percent
saying it was right and 27 percent saying it was a mistake. The
remaining 38 percent were undecided or were not aware of the case.
People who said the investigation should continue but thought
the Justice Department was mistaken in filing the antitrust suit
tended to view the appropriate role for government as more a
referee than a prosecutor. They also regarded some of what they had
heard of Microsoft's aggressive business practices as part of the
rough-and-tumble of capitalism.
The Times/CBS poll does illustrate the high regard that most
Americans have for Microsoft and for Gates. Nearly five times as
many people have a favorable opinion of Gates as have an
unfavorable opinion 39 percent to 8 percent, with the rest
undecided or unfamiliar with Gates. The favorable-unfavorable split
for President Clinton in the same poll is much more evenly divided:
at 45 percent favorable, 37 percent unfavorable and the rest
undecided.
In the case of Microsoft, familiarity breeds respect or at
least familiarity with its products does. On almost every Microsoft
question asked in the poll, the more that people used computers,
the more pro-Microsoft their answers were. For example, among
people who not only use computers but have installed software on
their own, 78 percent had a favorable opinion of Microsoft compared
with 55 percent of all those questioned for the poll.
Most Americans are technological optimists, according to the
Times/CBS poll, with 59 percent saying that computers solve more
problems than they create, while 29 percent say they create more
problems than they solve. Among computer users, 71 percent see the
machines as solving more problems than they create. And two-thirds
of Americans now use a computer either at home or at work,
according to the survey.
