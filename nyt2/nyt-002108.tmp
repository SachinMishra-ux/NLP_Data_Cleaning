The viewing appetite for a new league also seems limited, at
least based on history. Did anybody really watch the USFL, the WFL
or, now, NFL Europe?
Years ago, you could excuse Donald Trump and other millionaires
for financing franchises in startup football leagues. Besides their
considerable egos, they were fueled by the memories of that great
success, the American Football League.
The AFL wrestled the brawnier NFL to the mat, sure, but that was
30 years ago when the sports and television landscape was quite
different.
The NFL had far fewer teams then, so there were far more
talented football players looking for work in the pro game. The NFL
had become rather conservative in its play calling, too, creating
demand for the AFL's wide-open style of play. Further, lots of
growing, attractive markets craved pro sports franchises back then,
and the American TV viewing audience was just in its infancy.
Not only is there plenty of pro football, there is college game
after college game every Saturday afternoon and evening in the
fall. There is a possibility that the new league would play in the
summer, but you remember how well that idea has worked in the past.
The NFL, stodgy as it is, could use a good shaking up or two.
Just listening to the incessant thumb-sucking debate over something
like instant replay makes you want to head butt your Motorola.
BERKELEY, Calif. As the dust settles from the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, we Californians should congratulate
ourselves on finally learning not to be duped by television
candidates.
For years we were mesmerized, even intoxicated, by expensive,
glowing television commercials with vivid graphics, flowing music
and easy-to-swallow sound bites.
But Californians are getting smarter. After two generations of
television politics, we're finally remembering that real
politicians like Davis get to know their constituents over the
years through face-to-face, extended conversations. Fundamentally,
real politics is about building trust over the long haul.
The point was this: Politics was hard. Politicians had to learn
to sweat, to take hard knocks in front of tough crowds. The lesson?
It takes courage to gain voters' respect.
