UNITED NATIONS It has become an article of faith among those
who oppose abortion in the United States that promoting abortion
anywhere else, particularly in the world's poorest countries, is
tantamount to an attack on the cultures of those countries. It is a
new argument from the conservative right, but it echoes charges
that the radical left used to make, to the effect that family
planning programs targeted at the Third World were a kind of
neo-imperialistic genocide.
A statistical look around the world shows that if cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. But other statistics
demonstrate that the pattern of legality does not reflect how women
in those societies choose to act.
In the global south, where abortion laws are the most
restrictive, abortion rates are still quite high; deaths from
abortion are much higher there than elsewhere, because the
abortions tend to be unsafe. The industrial countries of the global
north are almost universally less restrictive in their abortion
laws. They also have the lowest rates of abortion-related deaths.
Of about 20 million unsafe sometimes legal, but more often
illegal abortions estimated to take place each year worldwide, 90
percent occur in developing countries, according to the World
Health Organization. Of the 80,000 deaths that result, 95 percent
are in poor nations. That number does not include women who die of
miscarriages due to health problems or poor prenatal care; such
data do not exist.
The anti-colonial case has been made forcefully by Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., who has blocked U.S. payments to the
United Nations with an amendment denying money to any organization
that lobbies for liberalized abortion laws in any country. Smith, a
supporter of international child survival programs, says helping
poor children, not preventing them from being born, should be the
priority of foreign aid.
His legislation, which President Clinton has vowed to veto when
it reaches his desk, has created alarm among family planning and
women's health organizations, who see its bar to advocating
abortion as a challenge to free speech and a chilling factor that
would reduce the amount of money going to all types of population
work, including contraception, in the poorest countries, where they
think it is needed most.
Family planning organizations and women's health groups do not
argue that abortion should be encouraged as a method of birth
control. But they do argue for less restrictive laws in many
countries on the ground that such laws would cut deaths. They also
say family planning and community health groups in Africa, Asia and
Latin America have to deal with the results of botched and
life-threatening abortions, sometimes by completing the process of
clearing the womb a procedure that would put them on the wrong
side of U.S. law if Smith's proposal were adopted.
Because family planning services are not available to millions
of women who want them more than 350 million in the developing
world, according to surveys they turn to abortion, even where
illegal, and will continue to do so as a last resort, experts say.
Of course, the Pentagon still hands out plenty of Purple Hearts
and Bronze Stars. But the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest
honor, has been awarded only twice for valorous action since the
Vietnam War: to two Army sergeants killed in Somalia in 1993 as
they tried to help wounded comrades.
Eight World War II veterans, including seven who were denied the
medal because they were black, have also received the medal in the
past two years.
