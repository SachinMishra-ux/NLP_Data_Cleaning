But in our world, security must be an overriding concern.
France, the most visited country on the planet on a per-capita
basis (tourists to residents), will be overrun by an extra 2.5
million soccer-crazy partisans in the weeks ahead, and some of them
will be from places where fomentation is the national pastime.
Iran, the U.S. team's opponent in Lyon on June 21, comes quickly
to mind. But the Iranians who have tickets should be a docile
bunch. The vast majority of them are government functionaries who
had a well-placed brother-in-law or cousin, and they are mad only
about their soccer lads.
At Iran's tourist office on the Champs Elyses, a giant
photograph of the country's superstar, Ali Daei, has been pasted
above the door. The Great Satan became a back-burner concern the
moment the Iranians qualified last in the field of 32 with a
final-minute goal in their final match.
Because few soccer fans will wind up on Alpine peaks or in
backwoods hostelries, the potential for chaos in the nine cities
hosting competition (two Paris-area stadiums are being used) is
huge. Nothing ruins the global-village, hands-across-the-water
ideal quicker than a bomb in a trash container or, almost as bad, a
sudden rail strike.
France's transportation-sector employees were made to sign blood
oaths to be kind to tourists, but the contract didn't include a
no-walkout promise. So Paris Metro workers and those of the RER
(regional) and SNCF (national) railways have staged halfhearted but ominous work stoppages in support of their proletarian
brothers, the striking Air France pilots.
If there is carnage during the World Cup, chances are it won't
have political overtones. The worst riots will be caused by
hysterical fans who have been told the soccer express to
Saint-Etienne or Toulouse has been canceled and they're going to
miss their nation's game.
NEW YORK Relief in the late innings is standard operating
procedure for the post-operative David Cone, and predictably, the
phone rang in the New York Yankees' bullpen in the sixth inning
Sunday. Graeme Lloyd got up after Cone hit one batter and walked
another, but when Cone retired Florida's Mark Kotsay, Lloyd sat
down without throwing a pitch.
Yankees relievers kept popping up in the bullpen over the next
three innings, like in a carnival game, but they would sit back
down when Cone continued to get outs, including the last. Cone
allowed two hits, struck out 14 batters and pitched his first
complete game since May 2, 1996, in beating the Florida Marlins 4-1
before 47,731 at Yankee Stadium.
The Yankees and Marlins are inhabiting opposite ends of baseball
at the moment. The Yankees have won seven straight games and 43 of
their last 52, and they are 44-13 over all; at this rate, they
would finish 125-37. The Marlins, the champions of baseball last
season, have lost 11 straight, and at this rate they would win 45
and lose 117. The Marlins began play Sunday 25 games behind the
Atlanta Braves in the NL East; according to the Elias Sports
Bureau, the last team to be that far behind after 60 games was the
1962 New York Mets, arguably the worst team ever.
But Cone, who has won all eight of his decisions since losing
his first on April 4, would have been highly effective against any
team. Fresh from eight days of rest, he threw hard, he had good
control improvement, Yankees manager Joe Torre said, that had
been evident in his last start, before his mother's Jack Russell
terrier bit him on the right index finger.
