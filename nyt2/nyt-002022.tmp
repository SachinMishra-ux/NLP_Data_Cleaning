The space shuttle Discovery recently carried the AMS into orbit,
and for a few more days the AMS is supposed to hang around the
shuttle's payload bay, trying to detect any antimatter particles
that may dance by. 
An international team of scientists from 37 research
institutions collaborated on the AMS, led by Samuel C.C. Ting, a
physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
(Paul A.M. Dirac, Samuel C.C. Ting. There's some kind of strange
double middle initial thing going on with antimatter scientists.
Perhaps some linguists and scientists will obtain a huge government
grant to study the phenomenon. I so-so hope.) 
One of the problems in trying to study antimatter is that it
doesn't seem to exist for very long. Anytime it gets close to
matter, both the matter and the antimatter annihilate themselves
and, in turn, produce huge amounts of energy. It's a process that
reminds me of some celebrity marriages. 
You have been quite patient until now not to demand to know
whether antimatter is the same as dark matter, which is what
scientists call all the unseen (so far) mass in the universe. Well,
no. They are not the same thing. 
But if dark matter has the symmetry to consist of both matter
and antimatter, as it may, scientists hope the AMS will help them
understand dark matter better. And speaking of the exquisite
balance of symmetry, please notice that I began this column with
the Depression and ended it with dark matter. Am I good or what? 
The new version (Windows; about $35-$40) goes beyond being just
another program that picks the route and spits out maps. It has
some interesting features not found in other programs.
For those with 3Com's popular PalmPilot handheld computer, the
program allows users to send directions from the software directly
to the PalmPilot. It also allows users to place photographs on a
map a handy feature if you want to indicate landmarks for turning
points.

On balance, I'd have to say that the fads of today aren't nearly
as annoying as the fads of years past.
