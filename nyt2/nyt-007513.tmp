Bagwell, the former NL MVP, hit only .247 in April and .234 in
May and was hitting less than .200 with runners in scoring position
until the past two weeks. Bell hit .398 in April but dropped off to
hit only .208 during May. Now both appear to be on the verge of
getting going.
When Bagwell returned from the disabled list, Astros manager
Larry Dierker inserted Bill Spiers in the second spot in the order,
and dropped Bell to third, Bagwell to cleanup and Moises Alou
(.325) to fifth.
What happened?: When Cincinnati's Brett Tomko defeated the
Dodgers late last season and again during the first weekend in
April, he looked like a budding star. His manager, Jack McKeon,
said Tomko had the stuff to win 20 this year, just his second in
the majors.
That, however, hasn't happened. After giving up six runs in 21/3
innings Monday in a 13-2 loss to Houston, Tomko entered his
Saturday start against the Astros 5-6 with a 5.03 ERA. A little
more than a month ago, he was 5-1 with a 2.98 ERA.
Tomko also has given up 10 home runs in his last nine starts. He
allowed only one in his first five. In his last six outings, which
includes five losses and a no-decision, Tomko has given up 32 runs
(30 earned) in 301/3 innings an 8.90 ERA. He hasn't won since May
13.
Tomko has worked to improve his shaken confidence by reading a
book on the mental art of pitching, but it hasn't been easy.
For his part, McKeon maintains his belief in the pitcher the
Reds believe will eventually mature into a real ace.
Robin could fly: Robin Ventura could be entering the final six
weeks of his White Sox career. But if the Sox plan to trade the
potential free-agent third baseman, general manager Ron Schueler
isn't saying.
Despite Schueler's position, the White Sox have made no attempt
to re-sign Ventura. His agent, Johnny Boggs, said he has not had
any contact with owner Jerry Reinsdorf or the Sox since an
unproductive meeting in spring training. Ventura is believed to be
seeking a four-year deal for $32 million.
Lehman, who frittered away the 54-hole lead at the past three
U.S. Opens, finds himself in position at the Olympic Club to win
again. With a five-birdie, three-bogey 68 that matched the lowest
score in yesterday's third round, Lehman will play in the final
twosome at the Open for a fourth consecutive year.
