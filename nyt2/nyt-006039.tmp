It also borrows from other programs, such as MetaTools' Fractal
Design Painter. It has nozzles that let you paint with specific
objects. For example, you can lay down a row of dice, cars,
airplanes, stars or any one of several dozen icons just by clicking
and dragging with your mouse. You can add others, too.
Version 5.0 is not a radical departure over 4.0. Instead,
developers have concentrated on making Photoshop which has a
notoriously steep learning curve easier to use. Many common
tasks, such as the aforementioned shadow creation, have finally
been automated.
Adobe has tweaked some of the commonly used tools in Photoshop
to make them friendlier. For example, artists who wanted to
indicate the edge of an object in an image had to painstakingly
draw around those edges. Now, the pencil and lasso tools are
magnetic the program itself senses where the edges are and clings
to them.
 Pablo, $99, KidBoard: When it comes time to draw something,
nothing beats a pen and paper. But most computer users who aren't
professional artists still struggle with a mouse, a distinctly
clunky drawing device.
Computer drawing tablets have been on the market for years, but
generally they've been priced out of reach of many consumers. Pablo
is the first quality drawing tablet aimed squarely at the home
market.
Its drawing area is decently sized, at about 8 inches by 6
inches. An attached overlay of plastic lets you put images
underneath for tracing.
The stylus can be attached by a cord on either side of the
table, making it comfortable for either right- or left-handers.
Using Pablo is simple. Just press a button on the stylus to
activate it. With art programs designed to work with a tablet and
all the titles mentioned here will the effects are similar to
using a real pen, brush or marker. The longer and harder you press
down, the darker and more pronounced the image will be on the
screen.
If you are used to drawing with a mouse, it may take a while to
get the hang of drawing on a tablet and getting the results you
want. But once you master Pablo, it will be difficult to go back.
