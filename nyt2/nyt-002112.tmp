There are many other examples: the coverage of the relationship
of Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado and Donna Rice; the arrest of Paul
Reubens, the actor who played Pee Wee Herman, on charges of
indecent exposure; the case of Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off her
husband's penis, and the trial of Marv Albert, the sportscaster, on
sexual assault charges.
Then in January, the charges that Clinton had an affair with a
White House intern, Ms. Lewinsky, catapulted oral sex onto the
front page, trailing behind it unsubstantiated rumors of such
things as a semen-stained dress and rumpled tissues retrieved from
the trash. Two months later, the Food and Drug Administration's
approval of Viagra put impotence at the top of the news.
Letitia Baldrige, the authority on manners, tosses a Viagra joke
into lectures. Robert Knight, the director of cultural studies for
the conservative Family Research Council, recalls parents chatting
about Albert's sexual proclivities on the sidelines of a Little
League game in suburban Virginia.
Debra Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States, also volunteers as a Sunday
school teacher in Westport, Conn., and recently found herself faced
with an eighth-grade class's questions about why Ms. Lewinsky might
have saved a semen-stained dress.
Dr. Tom Lee, the medical director for Partners Community Health
Care, a network of doctors and hospitals in Boston, recalls the
discussion that ensued at a meeting at his office when it was
announced that one health insurance company would cover the cost of
12 Viagra pills a month.
One colleague told Lee that she did not believe the estimates of
the average number of times couples have intercourse in a month.
She suggested that men running health maintenance organizations
were authorizing more pills than necessary, in a kind of sexual
swaggering.
Neil Lewis, a 55-year-old management psychologist in Atlanta,
was eating lunch with the chief executive of a company that had
hired him as a consultant on organization effectiveness, when he
was startled to be solicited for advice on whether the man should
try Viagra, the pill to treat impotence.
Patricia Marx, a writer and one of a half-dozen women who took
part in a round-table discussion of the sexual allegations against
Clinton, the transcript of which appeared in The New York Observer,
said it seemed as if new, usable words have been added to the
dictionary.
Again and again, news media coverage has legitimized language
and topics once considered taboo. Stories with sexual elements are
reported on the evening news, dissected on talk shows and picked up
by late-night comedians, whose jokes resurface the next day at the
proverbial water cooler.
Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs in Washington, said Jay Leno, David Letterman, Conan
O'Brien, and Bill Maher told 729 jokes about Clinton's sex life in
their monologues in the first five months of 1998 (compared with
about 250 in all 12 months of 1997).
