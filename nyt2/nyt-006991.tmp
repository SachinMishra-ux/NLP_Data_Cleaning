Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
