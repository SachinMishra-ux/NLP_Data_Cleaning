Now, as her presence fades and a collection of her ball gowns
goes on paid exhibition at the new Ronald Reagan Building in
Washington, Prince Charles is beginning to enjoy a different kind
of reputation. With his enduring lover, Camilla Parker Bowles,
somewhere out of sight, and the prince more often in view in the
company of his sons, there seems to be a welling public regard for
him.
He is seen as a protective father, an innovative manager of his
estates, a thoughtful man, a modest, candid future king. In the
warmth of this summer, as his 50th birthday nears this fall, it
seems the prince and his country are starting to graft. After such
a long period of growing apart, it is a startling sight.
SAN FRANCISCO Payne Stewart thought the man in his own twosome
would be the one to worry about Sunday at The Olympic Club. So did
the gallery. So did most of the media. So did Melissa Lehman, who
often could not see over the fans to note the pain and frustration
on his husband's face.
Again, the gods made their decision and Tom Lehman faded on a
U.S. Open Sunday, the victim of a cruel putter and possibly of
history, too.
Lee Janzen had foiled Stewart before, by two shots in the 1993
U.S Open with a record-tying score of 272 at Baltusrol. On Sunday
he did it again, coming from as many as seven shots off the lead to
win the 98th U.S Open.
For all the complaining Stewart had done about landing in a
divot filled with sand on the 12th hole or the USGA warning he
received for slow play, all that really mattered in the end was the
20-foot putt he stood over on the 18th hole. For a second or two it
looked headed for the cup, but just broke off, securing the win and
ending Stewart's chance to force a playoff.
While history might think otherwise, suggesting that the man
with the four-shot lead with a round to play indeed blew the U.S.
Open, Stewart lobbied hard to note the quality of Janzen's
2-under-68. When the champion finishes at even par, all seemed to
agree, the venue emerged as the real winner.
Lehman, who has come up short for four straight U.S Opens,
seemed the real victim. When be bogeyed the 14th hole to drop to
4-over, he knew his day was over. The double-bogey at 17th was just
added pain.
Janzen, who had not won a PGA Tour event in three years and blew
his opportunity to win a second Players Championship in March with
a Sunday 79, was filled with emotion after the win. That it came on
Father's Day, with his dad Larry in the crowd and son Connor
present, made for, well, an Olympic moment.
Reggie Jackson was a player who knew how to stir up a laugh with
his one-liners as well as he could shake up a game with his bat. He
once demonstrated that agility with one quip after a game in which
he struck out four consecutive times, but won it with a grand slam
in his final at-bat.
