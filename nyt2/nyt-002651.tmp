Harris, a 40-year-old former correction officer, received a
citation from the city in 1987 for saving the life of a fellow
guard during a riot at a Brooklyn jail. On May 19, he was convicted
of first-degree murder in the deaths of three people at Club
Happiness, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, in December 1996.
Attorneys for Harris, describing him as a man with severe
psychological problems and an addiction to alcohol and cocaine, had
pressed jurors to spare his life.
The lawyers have already filed a motion challenging the
constitutionality of death by lethal injection, and an appeal of
the sentence is expected soon. The death penalty was reinstated in
New York in 1995.
Perhaps it will never be known exactly what led the panel to
send Harris to the death chamber. Certainly, Sunday, few on the
12-member panel wanted to repeat or reflect on what went on inside
the jury room.
Whatever their precise reasons, the sentence they rendered
appeared to have been laced with ambivalence. They deliberated for
22 hours over four days. On Friday, a court officer informed Acting
Justice Anne Feldman of flared tempers inside the jury room. On
Saturday afternoon, as the jury forewoman read the verdict, one
woman on the panel began sobbing so uncontrollably that she nearly
collapsed. Two of the jurors noted in their verdict report that
Harris had suffered from some emotional distress, though that did
not, in their minds, sufficiently mitigate the crimes for which he
was convicted.
Nor did the cool reticence that Harris maintained through the
end help his cause. When a witness who managed to escape his
rampage took the stand, Harris smiled, showing no remorse, recalled
the juror who spoke on condition of anonymity. And although his
mother testified in his behalf and his brother, an ordained
minister, asked the jury to spare his life, Harris chose not to
testify even in the sentencing phase of his trial.
Harris' lawyer, Russell Neufeld, said Sunday that he and his
client decided against testifying because the judge had ruled that
the prosecution would have the final say in stark contrast to
noncapital crimes cases, in which the defendant is allowed to
testify last.
Defense lawyers had conceded that Harris was responsible for the
murders, but not because he wanted to eliminate witnesses, as the
prosecution had argued.
Rather, the defense had argued, Harris suffered from serious
psychological problems, including those that stemmed from having
been severely beaten as a child by his mother, as well as addiction
to alcohol and cocaine. The jail riot had traumatic effects, the
defense had contended, and the city Correction Department forced
Harris to resign in 1991.
The verdict drew polar responses. Gov. George Pataki, whose 1994
campaign was based partly on support for the death penalty, and who
signed into law the measure reinstating the penalty soon after
taking office, said the sentence would send a powerful message to
criminals.
