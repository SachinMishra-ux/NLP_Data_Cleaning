HDTV-FCC (Undated) With the rollout of digital television too
much in flux for the liking of federal regulators, the FCC has set
up a get-tough task force headed by one of its commissioners, Susan
Ness. Among the imponderables: the first digital TV sets to hit the
market this fall will probably not be compatible with digital cable
television signals. By Joel Brinkley.
DOMAIN-NAMES-ASSESS (Undated) The government has decided to
turn the management of Internet domain names and thus the
management of the Internet itself over to an as-yet-unformed
private corporation, representing various Internet interests. By
Peter H. Lewis.
CISCO-COMPETE (Undated) For most of the past decade, Cisco
Systems Inc. has been steamrolling competitors in data networking.
Its routers and switches dominate the Internet and corporate
networks that try to get disparate sorts of computers to talk to
each other. But lately, Cisco is on a collision course with a set
of new, much bigger competitors. A look at how Lucent and Nortel
are angling for Cisco's network equipment business.
PRISON-HEALTHCARE (Undated) With the ranks of prisoners rising
an average of 8 percent every year, prison health care is an
expensive proposition. To control costs and enhance security, a
handful of states are trying out telemedicine -- healthcare via
telecommunications. With government agencies, managed care
providers, and legislators watching, these programs are serving as
proving grounds for bringing telemedicine to the broader
population.
TV-CNN-MEDIA (Undated) It is hard to know what came first the idea of partnerships between Time-Warner's weekly magazines and
Turner Broadcasting's all-news network CNN, or the idea of changing
CNN's humdrum reputation. But when Time Warner Inc. and Turner
merged in the fall of 1996, both ideas began to percolate. A look
at what's behind the big facelift at CNN. By Lawrie Mifflin.
TV-NEWSVIEWERS-MEDIA (Undated) Following a pattern seen in
entertainment viewing, Americans now watch news programs on cable
television networks about as regularly as those on broadcast
networks, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press. The researchers also found that the number of
people who get their news from the Internet is rising rapidly, and
estimated that almost as many people use the Internet on a typical
weekday as spend time reading a magazine. By Lawrie Mifflin.
Victory Gallop has a more important and prominent nose than
Cyrano de Bergerac or Pinocchio. His narrow margin of victory in
Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park not only prevented
Real Quiet from capturing the Triple Crown and a $5 million bonus but it also reopened the race for championship honors among this
year's talented crop of 3-year-olds. 
Had Real Quiet won, he would have been assured an Eclipse Award
as the champion 3-year-old. Now, a number of colts including
Victory Gallop, Coronado's Quest, Indian Charlie and even Lil's Lad
and Favorite Trick are back in the running, and their presence
offers promise of dramatic matches in a series of important races
for 3-year-olds in the second half of the year.
Real Quiet and Victory Gallop emerged as the best of their
generation through a thrilling series of races in the Triple Crown.
They were one-two in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and
Belmont, with Real Quiet winning two of the three, and their
rivalry should continue this summer. Their trainers said the
$750,000 Travers Stakes at the Derby distance of a mile and
one-quarter on Aug. 29 at Saratoga is their next major objective.
Elliott Walden, who trains Victory Gallop, and Real Quiet's
trainer, Bob Baffert, said Sunday morning at Belmont that their
colts emerged from Saturday's thrilling race tired but in good
health. Walden felt a sense of accomplishment for having stayed the
course on the Triple Crown trail.
