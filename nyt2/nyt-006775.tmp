According to the script, the spray contained tularemia, a highly
infectious germ that causes chills, fever, muscle aches, fatigue,
pneumonia-like symptoms and can be fatal. The germs spread quickly
throughout the building, whose windows were sealed, as they are in
so many modern buildings. Within 15 minutes, virtually the entire
building was infected.
In the war game, officials said, by the time doctors diagnosed
the mysterious illness as tularemia and began prescribing proper
antibiotics, the epidemic had run its course. Because the
hypothetical terrorist had chosen a germ that causes a disease with
a 35 percent mortality rate, only a third of the 1,080 people who
fell ill died.
WASHINGTON Ten days after the Food and Drug Administration
took the heart medication, Posicor, off the market, a new warning
has been issued about the drug: A team of doctors in Oregon has
reported that four patients who stopped taking Posicor went into
shock after switching to other drugs, and one of them has died as a
result.
Each of the four cases occurred before Posicor's withdrawal, and
the drug's manufacturer, Roche Laboratories of Nutley, N.J., did
not learn of them until last week. The company has since cautioned
doctors to wait seven days before giving certain drugs calcium
channel blockers and beta-blockers to patients who have
discontinued Posicor.
Posicor, which treats high blood pressure and the chest pains
known as angina, was pulled off pharmacy shelves in 38 countries on
June 8 because it causes toxic and, in some cases, lethal
interactions with 26 other drugs. It was being taken by 400,000
people around the world, 200,000 of them in the United States.
At the time it was withdrawn, the drug agency and Roche
instructed patients not to stop taking Posicor, but to consult
their doctors about alternative therapies.
In an interview Thursday, however, Horowitz said Posicor remains
in the bloodstream for so long that it can cause toxic drug
interactions even in patients who have stopped taking it.
The four patients Horowitz identified ranged in age from 55 to
79. In each case, their doctors had stopped prescribing Posicor
because the drug was not working well. Each patient suffered shock,
in which the blood pressure drops to dangerous levels, or other
serious side effects within 12 hours of taking the new drugs. Three
survived after intensive treatment in hospital emergency rooms and
intensive care units; the 79-year-old, a woman, died.
Horowitz notified the FDA and had submitted an article to the
Journal of the American Medical Association when Posicor was
withdrawn from the market. Four days later, on June 12, Roche
mailed a warning to doctors.

can outflank and outflatter, outbluff and outbully all the other
players in the room.
