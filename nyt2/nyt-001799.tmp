But hey, this is California; too much good sense all at once may
be hazardous to your health. (To publish this excellent 750-word article, it must be purchased the rate is not prohibitive from New York Times Syndicate sales

Both geographically and culturally, California has always seemed
on the extreme edge of the United States. This is where the crazy
fashions start, from oat bran to surfing shorts to New Age
crystal-gazing.
It is where a black mayor can appear in Chinese robes on a
catwalk, and his rival can be photographed naked in the shower; it
is where anything goes, morally, spiritually or gastronomically,
except the lighting up of a cigarette in a bar.
Small wonder that many Americans have often dreamed of seeing
California, like some extravagant growth, painlessly removed from
the body politic.
There, a millionaire candidate, Al Checchi, who had spent around
$40 million on his campaign (a record, even for America) was
soundly beaten in the Democratic primary for the governorship; and
another millionaire, Darrell Issa, was beaten in the Republican
primary for the Senate.
Voters had more sense than to be swayed by these men's money,
which was a poor cover for the fact that they had no political
experience and the vaguest ideological convictions. Instead, they
opted for candidates whose careers commended them.
It was not a flawless choice: Gray Davis, the relatively
impoverished victor over Checchi, now owes a lot of money to the
special interests who helped him. But the result adds a hopeful
note to the endless debate about the proper role of money in
American elections.
Checchi's appearance on the scene was not, as some feared,
pernicious: he challenged the establishment at his own expense,
which was a good thing, but then found his millions did not sway
the voters, which was just as encouraging.
Checchi's ads swamped the airwaves but did not work, suggesting
there may be a natural limit to the usefulness of spending money on
commercials (the tactic which most inflates the cost of political
campaigning in America).
Above all, California has shown that voters can usually be
trusted: in all the agonizing over campaign-finance reform, perhaps
the only vital rule is that they should know where a candidate's
money comes from.
