In a clear voice tinged with an American accent, Woodward
proclaimed her innocence in the death of Matthew Eappen, blamed a
flawed US justice system for her fate and insisted she has not sold
her story to the British press.
Woodward was asked if she had a message for the child's parents,
Sunil and Deborah Eappen, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against her earlier this week.
It was the first time the 20-year-old au pair has spoken
publicly since she was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of
Matthew, the 8-month-old infant who died in her care in February
1997.
On Tuesday, the SJC upheld her manslaughter conviction but
refused to order a new sentence, freeing Woodward to leave Boston
for England. The next day, she caught a first-class seat on a
British Airways overnight flight.
Though several reporters accompanied Woodward on the plane to
London's Heathrow Airport, bodyguards including a Massachusetts
state trooper in full uniform paid by the airline barred anyone
from getting close to her or her father.
The first-class tickets, worth $4,200 each, were donated by a
benefactor who wished to remain anonymous, according to Andrew
Miller, the local Member of Parliament for Woodward's home district
of Cheshire. Miller, who organized the press conference at the
Manchester airport, maintained the tickets were not paid for by a
media organization.
When the Woodwards arrived in London, a pack of British and
American reporters and cameramen trampled each other to get as
close as possible to the somber-looking father and daughter.
Though they were to fly from London to Manchester in a smaller
jet, British Airways told Woodward and her father that they could
not guarantee security from reporters on the plane. As a result,
Miller drove the Woodwards 200 miles north to Manchester Airport
for the press conference.
Reached by phone in Chicago, Deborah Eappen's brother, Paul
Spellman, critized Woodward for failing to acknowlege his sister
and brother-in-law during the press conference, and said the family
is offended that she still won't acknowlege her responsibility.
Back in Elton, Woodward was escorted by local police to her
front door. She bounded out of a chauffered minibus and hugged her
sister Vicky. Cassie, the family's German shepherd, joined in the
celebration.
