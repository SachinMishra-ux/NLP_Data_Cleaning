The federation intends to have up to 120 youth players in its
professional development program by 2009, according to Remedi.
How far the project will succeed remains to be seen, and the
future of soccer as a spectator sport is anyone's guess.
But John Williams, a sociologist at the University of Leicester,
doubts that soccer will ever become a major sport in the United
States.
Duncan Sisson, 18, from New York, who watched the U.S. national
team beaten by Germany 2-0 on June 15 at the Paris stadium, said he
prefers soccer to other games like baseball and basketball.
The quintet that saw its first-half champion finish just two
games over .500 refused to bow down to a Valley Division that
claimed four of five teams completing the halfway mark with at
least a .500 record, including first-place San Jose's 46-24 mark.
The Freeway took a major detour in the fifth inning, however,
and the favored Valley Division took command, scoring five times to
win the game 9-4.
With his team leading 3-2, Freeway Division pitcher Brent Iddon
of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes was the victim of both timely Valley
hitting and shoddy defense by his teammates.
The carnage began with singles by Michael Byas and Jeff DaVanon.
With Byas at third, right fielder Luke Allen misjudged Josh
Klimek's fly ball for a three-base error and the go-ahead runs.
Iddon recorded one out but yielded a smash off the
right-center-field fence by Modesto's Cody McKay for a triple. When
Allen bobbled the ball for his second error of the inning, the A's
catcher chugged around third and scored to make it 6-3.
The circus atmosphere didn't stop there after Rod Barajas
doubled and moved to third on a groundout. With Visalia's Mike
Holmes in for Iddon, JetHawk Adonis Harrison's grounder to the
right side was booted by second baseman Dionys Cesar of Visalia.
San Jose's Juan Dilone, a 25-year-old veteran of seven
minor-league seasons, was the unanimous choice as the game's most
valuable player after going for 3 for 4 with a home run and three
RBI.
