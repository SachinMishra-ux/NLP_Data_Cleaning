Yes, the idea of a global pan-Islamic community with a common
divine mission on earth has been trumpeted in Islamic oratory over
the years. But so far national interests have prevailed. Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini learned that lesson after he tried and failed to export his Islamic revolution.
Granted, Pakistan got some help from Muslim countries like Libya
and Saudi Arabia years ago for its nuclear program. But much more
important support came from other places: blueprints, enriched
uranium, tritium and scientific know-how from China; technology
(stolen) from the Netherlands. And the United States gave its tacit
consent all during the years that Pakistan's help was needed in the
Afghan conflict.
Now that Pakistan, which desperately needs financial aid, has
offended the United States by staging its nuclear tests, it would
seem to be in Pakistan's interest to keep its technology from
spreading something that would only offend the United States
more. Even if Pakistan decided to export its technology at a future
point, the reasons would most likely have nothing to do with
religion.
One reason is the utterances of Muslims themselves, who over the
years have publicly declared the need for an Islamic bomb.
Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who ousted Bhutto and had him hanged,
condemned the rest of the world in 1986 for branding Pakistan's
bomb Islamic but in the same breath promoted the notion.
Another reason the notion persists is that Israel and its
supporters have long found it convenient to demonize Islamic states
and movements whose leaders find it convenient to assert
religion-based claims to Jerusalem. For the Israelis, the idea that
Islamic fervor could go nuclear provides a justification for
maintaining its own unacknowledged nuclear arsenal.
Over the long run, the most serious impact of the nuclear
explosions by Pakistan and India within the Islamic world may
be to revive the lust of rivals among the Islamic nations to
possess their own nuclear weapons.
Pakistan is, after all, a peer of a number of Middle Eastern
countries with grand ambitions and an even grander sense of their
place in the world's history Iranians who identify with ancient
Persia, Iraqis who remember Nebuchadnezzar, Egyptians who hark back
to the pharoahs and Syrians prideful of the ancient glories of
Damascus.
All can ask: Who are these upstart Pakistanis to think they lead
the Islamic world? What about us?
Officially, Egypt has underscored that the recent nuclear tests
prove just how urgent it is the make the Middle East a nuclear-free
zone. But some Egyptian commentators implied that Arab countries
made a mistake in signing on to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty.
