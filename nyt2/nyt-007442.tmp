But the Mexican players wanted more than a chance to score in
the 55th minute, they wanted a chance to play the rest of this
match on even terms, and before Dallas had a chance to reach into
his pocket, five players had formed an angry wall in front of him
and screamed for a red card. Dallas took his time, but he would
soon grant the Mexican wish.
It was the eighth red card awarded in the last seven matches of
these World Cup finals. But unlike other coaches who have fallen
victim to the new zeal, Leekens declined to cry foul.
When Mexican Captain Alberto Garcia Aspe put that penalty kick
into the lower right corner of the Belgian goal, neither he nor his
teammates were feeling the heat, and on their next serious chance
in the 63rd minute, they would score the equalizer. This goal had
nothing in common with Wilmots' ungainly efforts. It came off a
wonderfully timed left-footed cross from Ramirez that striker
Cuauhtemoc Blanco put past goalkeeper Filip de Wilde with a left
footed volley in mid-air that looked every bit as difficult as it
was.
CLEVELAND Ronald Reagan was voted into the White House the
last year the Yankees won 100 or more games, in 1980. Don Mattingly
never played on a pinstriped team that won 100 games, nor did Dave
Righetti. No easy feat, 100 victories.
But the Yankees of 1998 are already halfway to that benchmark
after beating Cleveland by 5-3 Saturday afternoon as David Wells
pitched eight strong innings. The Yankees have played fewer games
than any other major league team, because of rainouts and the
Yankee Stadium closing, but they became the first to win 50 games
this season. The Atlanta Braves had a 49-24 record as they prepared
to play Montreal Saturday night.
The Yankees have won four of their last eight, their pace
slowing somewhat in the midst of what figures to be the most
challenging two weeks of their season, with games in Baltimore and
Cleveland, with games against the Braves and the Mets, and without
Bernie Williams.
Nevertheless, the Yankees' winning percentage is .746; they
would win 121 games if they continue this pace, which would shatter
the modern-day major-league record of 111 victories. Should they
win 47 of their remaining 95 games less than half they would
finish the season 97-65. A hundred victories seems inevitable,
especially since all elements of the team are functioning
effectively.
With Wells' outing Saturday, the Yankees' pitching rotation has
turned in 17 consecutive starts of five and a third innings or
more; only twice in 39 games since May 6 has a Yankees starter
failed to last five innings.
Wells' performance may have been his best since his perfect game
on May 17. His curveball dived across the strike zone, his fastball
was explosive, his command nearly impeccable. Jorge Posada, the
Yankees' catcher, would set his target, inside or outside, and
Wells would hit it constantly, expertly. Wells allowed two runs,
eight hits, no walks and struck out eight.
The Yankees' offense has sputtered somewhat in the absence of
Williams, and Tino Martinez, the first baseman, has not regained
his stroke since being hit in the back by Baltimore's Armando
Benitez last month. Martinez has said his right shoulder sometimes
feels weak, as he pulls the bat through the strike zone.
