Not quite, Jerry. And a longer gape at the final score would
explain that the Bulls offense in Game 3 of the NBA Finals was
hardly the difference at United Center last night.
Sure, the Bulls beat ragged the old cliche of defense winning
championships. Yep, the Jazz are tired of hearing about how good
the Bulls are as they shoot for a sixth championship.
By the way, after Sunday's fill in the discerning adjective
here the Jazz are broken and picking up the pieces.
It only seems as if Utah has been eliminated from the Finals.
The series is far from over. However, if ever was such a thing as a
commanding 2-1 lead, the Bulls have just that.
(BBOX)Utah's point total was the fewest ever by a team in an NBA
game since the advent of the 24-second shot clock in 1954.
(BBOX)The Jazz made just 21 field goals and scored only 23
points in the second half the fewest ever in an NBA Finals game.
In addition, Chicago has never lost a playoff series after
taking the lead. Not only have they stolen the homecourt advantage
in this series, Games 4 and 5 are at United Center. The Bulls are
8-1 at home in the playoffs.
Malone watched the waning moments of Game 3 from the bench. The
Bulls led by 18 points at halftime and owned a 27-point advantage
by the start of the fourth quarter.
Chicago snatched the game's momentum with one simple yet
hard-to-do adjustment. They controlled Malone and John Stockton,
and the rest of Utah's pieces fell apart.
Scottie Pippen's ability to roam and disrupt Stockton was the
key. Pippen often defended whomever was an offensive liability on
the floor for Utah. As soon as Stockton crossed midcourt, Pippen
doubled off his man and ran toward Stockton.
