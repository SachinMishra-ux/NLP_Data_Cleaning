Sure, they understood the magnitude of it all. Kuchar, who just
finished his sophomore year at Georgia Tech, isn't even the best
player on his college team. He didn't win an NCAA championship. He
didn't even win the conference tournament.
Yet in two of golf's headline events, Kuchar has been
unflappable. He shot even par at the Masters, tying for 21st place,
walking away from $40,000 because of his amateur status. And after
50 holes at the Open, Kuchar was in third place, taming a course
that sent most of the field searching for liquid aspirin.
For two days, Kuchar was paired with the Ernie Els and Justin
Leonard, defending champions from the U.S. and British Open. After
36 holes, he flattened both by a combined 13 strokes.
Even more solid: In the four professional tournaments Kuchar has
entered, his worst round is 76. It happened at Augusta, when
howling winds descended upon the second round. It happened
Saturday, when the boa constrictor known as The Olympic Club
finally put the squeeze on Kuchar.
By golfing standards, the Kuchars might be having too much fun,
the kid stealing the show, the father/caddie pumping his fists
after every good shot. On Friday, Leonard was asked whether the
histrionics emoting from the elder Kuchar were a bit over the top.
Now that final exams are over, Kuchar has a tough decision to
make. He doesn't want to shut the door on college, but he is
thriving on the allure of big-time golf. He must decide whether to
turn pro, cashing in his innocence for prize money. And somewhere,
a toothpaste company has discovered the perfect spokesman.
But all of that can wait. For now, he has one more day in the
sun, one more day to bask in a love affair that has turned his
peers a shade of green and the golfing world on its ear.
They were left in the rain at Coors Field, hoping to squeeze
another victory out of their final at-bat and wondering if they can
afford to lose anyone else.
When Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi failed to score the tying run
from second in the ninth, the Dodgers' had their answer. Their 7-6
loss to the Colorado Rockies was coupled with news that Bobby
Bonilla was headed to the disabled list with a viral infection that
might be the reason he has played so poorly since his arriving last
month.
A victory on the night that first-place San Diego lost for the
first time in 12 games would have been the Dodgers' third straight
and a little bright spot as Martinez tries to decide whether to
have shoulder surgery.
