Anyone who keeps his money in yen is losing not just the
interest spread but also the exchange gains, a total of well over
10 percent per annum for the past five years.
What is surprising is not the yen collapse we see today but the
absence of collapse years ago when it was already clear that the
economy would not recover quickly.
Timidity, misguided patriotism and optimism for early recovery
were the main reasons why most Japanese kept their money in Japan.
It has taken the best part of five years, and some easing of the
rules on sending money abroad, for depositors to get smart.
Rather than loss of confidence or the selling out of Japan, what
we see now is a belated understanding of how foreign exchange
markets work.
Similarly with the economy generally. It has long been obvious
that no economy, not even Japan's, could stand a sudden collapse of
the grossly inflated asset values built up during Japan's bubble
economy of the early '90s.
Worse, once the collapse got under way there was every chance
that it would spiral. Even interest rates at close to zero would
not stop the rot.
The one person to realize this was the then-prime minister and
Keynesian economist Kiichi Miyazawa, back in 1992. But, as he said
on a recent television program, his proposal then for the
government to step in decisively to rescue bank loans already
turning sour because of collapsing asset values was derided on
every side, and by the business community especially.
In particular, we had the unbelievably foolish attempt late last
year to introduce an item that had long been high on the Finance
Ministry agenda, namely, a long-term program of severe fiscal
restraint at precisely the moment when the economy needed fiscal
expansion.
Meanwhile, U.S. experts were urging their favorite agenda item,
massive tax cuts in a nation where high savings propensity and
current pessimism guarantee that such cuts will simply end up as
extra savings, which is the last thing needed by Japan's
demand-starved economy.
Fortunately, the politicians have at last begun to stop
listening to these experts. Firm action to expand government
spending and rescue the banking system is at last being promised.
