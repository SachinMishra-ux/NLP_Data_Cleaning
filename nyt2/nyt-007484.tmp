Despite temperatures striking 103 Friday, a record high for
Jacksonville, firefighters spent the day preventing rather than
putting out flames. Thanks to little wind, the few fires that
popped up were quickly checked, and no new fires began.
Lt. Brad Havrilla of Palm Beach County spent most of the day
fighting through forest to water down smoldering pine. He
concentrated on the perimeter of a 12-acre area that caught fire
two days ago.
A man whose Alachua home was in the path of a wildfire Wednesday
wouldn't leave. He had greeted firefighters with an M-16, according
to a firefighter who talked the man into letting his wife leave the
home.
MERCURY, Nev. To visit the Nevada Test Site, the nation's
primary nuclear proving ground for more than four decades, and
stand near a crater blasted deep into the desert bedrock, is an
exercise in silence.
The dry lake beds and thorny plains where scientists detonated
nuclear weapons during the Cold War are now, in peacetime, mostly
devoid of activity and hundreds of sheds and warehouses that once
housed personnel and research facilities are now eerily empty.
In an effort to generate money and promote economic development
here in southern Nevada following a moratorium on nuclear testing
in 1992, the government has begun to transform parts of this base where the staff has been cut from 10,000 to 2,500 into a business
park of sorts.
Companies are invited to open facilities at the test site whose main entrance is near this small town 65 miles north of Las
Vegas with the unusual lures of restricted access and absence of
neighbors who, for example, might complain about the use of toxic
chemicals.
The three-year-old program is similar to the Defense
Department's effort to help communities hurt by military
downsizing. But there are some important differences: The test site
is under no threat of closing, has no plans to sell off land and is
mandated to stay ready for nuclear tests in case international
tensions rise.
The only tenant so far is Fluid Tech, a company that cleans
equipment contaminated with low-level radiation. To its relief, it
has found a warm welcome inside a massive abandoned hangar with
steel blast doors, cleaning bays and an overhead crane. There, in
the '60s, scientists tried to develop a nuclear-powered rocket.
Fluid Tech's staff of about 40 workers and those government
employees not housed on the base live in such surrounding
communities as Las Vegas, Amargosa Valley, Tonopah and Pahrump, all
within two hours' drive of the test-site entrance.
