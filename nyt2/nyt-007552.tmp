One of the few golfers to make up ground on Stewart was Tom
Lehman, one of only three golfers to break par Saturday. Lehman, of
course, has been extremely close to winning the last three Opens third in 1995, second in 1996, and tied for the lead at
Congressional last year when his shot found the water on the 17th
hole on the final day and he finished third.
Among the many golfers who took a free fall Saturday, one of the
most painful was by amateur Matt Kuchar, who will turn 20 Sunday.
Kuchar was alone in second place, 1 over par, when he teed off on
the 14th hole, but he proceeded to three-putt the hole, the first
of four straight bogeys, which dropped him off the leaderboard.
Meanwhile, Brad Faxon of Barrington, R.I., to whom the Open
never has been kind, was in ideal position Saturday to make his
first mark on an Open leaderboard as he started the day at 1 over,
four shots behind Stewart. Faxon needed only to play a consistent
round of near-par golf to be in the thick of the battle.
Deer either smacked a pitch far over the outfield wall or struck
out mightily, the buttons on his shirt nearly bursting on every
swing.
Makes you wonder how the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Deer will fare in
his post-baseball career, which at the moment, is drag racing.
Deer either will blow the doors off a rival or get his 1955
Chevy BelAir off the starting line too early and red light, causing
an immediate disqualification.
When Deer retired, he renewed that love and purchased a 1967
Chevy Camaro, which he raced in the National Hot Rod Association's
super street sportsman category.
Later, he talked his parents into moving from California to
Mesa, where Deer has lived for several years, and persuaded his dad
to resume his own drag racing career.
Bob Deer now is driving the Camaro and Rob recently purchased a
1955 Chevy BelAir and competes in super gas.
Bob Deer, who still works full time at Falcon Field, will travel
with his son next month to Sonoma, Calif., and compete in a
national event at Sears Point Raceway. Primarily, however, the
elder Deer's plans are to compete only locally at Speedworld,
Firebird International Raceway Park or Southwestern International
Raceway in Tucson.
