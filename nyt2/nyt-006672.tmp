As for Segal's play with still lifes and Cubism, or his late
portrait drawings, it's enough to say that he is most compelling
when he deals with the human figure in three dimensions.

Camp is not the desired solution for producers of period pieces
like this, but Anagnost and his forces did not have much choice.
The plot is a tangle of regal figures, assumed names and mistaken
identities, and so overblown seem the sentiments to our ears today
that modernizing this piece for late-20th-century palates would
probably mean junking everything except Vivaldi's music. This might
not be a bad idea.
The self-mocking approach is applied with an appropriately light
touch. Lynn Redgrave's narration between numbers is the principle
device, but there were discreet bits of business throughout the
evening.
It was a lavish application of the opera-in-concert format. The
singers often added a crown or a kingly robe to standard evening
dress. Strewn around the stage were columns, garden statuary and
urns sprouting greenery. Flowers were everywhere. The seven singers
reclined in period armchairs when not at work.
An audience that literally filled Tully Hall seemed happy to sit
for three hours, and there were some good singers for it to hear.
As Lisea, Julia Anne Wolf's muted mezzo-soprano was a steadying
influence. Rockland Osgood (Tamese) was an attractive tenor. As
Barzane, Robert Crowe's countertenor bravely attacked Vivaldi's
high-flying music, suffering only one near meltdown. As Miranda,
Theresa Cincione's soprano worked well at times but was unsuited
for the part's upper-range adventures.
Ellen Rabiner, also a mezzo-soprano, took the title role with
great emphasis and sureness. Stephen Bryant was the strong, solid
Cisardo. I especially liked the evening's Nicandro, Julie Newell, a
soprano whose sustained musicality and sureness with florid
figuration sounded as good as any singing of the evening.
Anagnost conducts Vivaldi with a relaxed musicality. No flashy
tempos, not much emphasis on spit-and-polish exactitude but rather
an atmosphere of roominess and leisure. The small orchestra of
assorted modern strings and brass also used recorders and
harpsichord. The Metropolitan Singers and the Greek Choral Society
were a little frayed and blowsy but they got by.
