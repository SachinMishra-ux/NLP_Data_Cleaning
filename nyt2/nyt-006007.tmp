The comments were made as part of a taped interview conducted by
conservative talk-show host Armstrong Williams for the America's
Voice network. The Hormel nomination was not mentioned.
Lott declined to personally respond to McCurry's statement or to
discuss whether he is holding up Hormel's nomination because of his
religious convictions.
Critics said Lott's comments reflect the growing influence
within the Congress and the Republican Party of socially
conservative groups such as Gary Bauer's Family Research Council
and James Dobson's Focus on the Family.
In her letter, Birch noted that the American Psychiatric
Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders
in 1973.
Although Lott did not discuss Hormel in the interview, those
working to secure his confirmation viewed the comments as a bad
sign. Hormel, heir to a meat-packing fortune and a regular
Democratic Party contributor, was nominated by Clinton last year to
serve as ambassador to Luxembourg.
The nomination was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. But a small group of Republicans complained about
Hormel's support for gay causes and have prevented the matter from
reaching the floor for a vote.
The senator said she hopes that Lott's attitude toward
homosexuality will not affect his decision on Hormel.
Wellstone has pledged to use parliamentary maneuvers to try to
force a vote on Hormel as soon as the Senate completes work on the
tobacco legislation.
The 49-to-48 vote was a crushing blow to trial attorneys. By
some estimates, a handful of law firms involved in tobacco
litigation had stood to win a staggering $100 billion in legal fees
over 25 years.
The attorneys were expecting to collect contingency fees ranging
from 3 to 30 percent of the settlement. They argued that they are
entitled to such a mammoth payout because they were willing to take
on the tobacco industry years ago when no one else would, and would
have received nothing had they lost.
