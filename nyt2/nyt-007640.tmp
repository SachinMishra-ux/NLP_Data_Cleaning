The squatters say the government has broken simple promises,
like handouts of seed corn, and among their leaders are veterans of
the 1980s war against white rule, whose association has recently
become so militant that it clashed with its former commander,
Mugabe.
If the squatters refuse to leave, the police may be asked to
move them.
As politicians moan about interminable fund-raising demands to
pay for brutal attack commercials, consultants who run many of
their campaigns and make many of the advertisements say it is not
their fault, and they suggest that if anyone is to blame for public
despair about the system, it is the news media.
A survey of more than 200 political consultants made public
Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
and the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at
American University found that the consultants were driven more by
the thrill of the competition than by ideology. And, by an
overwhelming proportion, they believed that focusing on an
opponent's weaknesses was perfectly acceptable.
The survey offered a rare glimpse into the minds of political
consultants, who play enormous roles in packaging candidates and
preparing them to run for office but usually are overshadowed by
the politicians for whom they work. This is the first time that so
many leading consultants most have been involved in major races
over the last three election seasons have been interviewed for
one survey.
While more than half of those surveyed blamed the media for
discouraging people from running for office because news
organizations dwell too much on the personal lives of candidates,
many consultants made clear that they were not particularly
impressed by their own candidates. Most consultants emphasized the
importance of their own roles and also criticized the public as
poorly informed and lacking sound judgment about issues.
James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies, said he was struck by the degree to which
consultants refused to take responsibility for public
disillusionment with the political process.
The consultants seemed to play down the importance of the
candidates' political skills. Asked for the most important factor
in winning an election, the candidate's campaign ability ranked
fourth after quality of the message, amount of money available and
the partisan makeup of the state or House district.
While 71 percent of the Republican consultants characterized the
quality of current House and Senate candidates as excellent or
good, only 39 percent of the Democratic consultants gave such high
marks to their candidates. Democrats were far more likely than
Republicans to say that the quality of congressional contenders had
diminished since they began working in politics.
And while Democratic consultants were much more inclined than
Republicans to favor reforming campaign finance, Democrats placed
slightly more importance on making money as a motivation for their
working on behalf of a candidate.
