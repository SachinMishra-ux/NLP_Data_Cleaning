As expected, the short but topsy-turvy and tree-lined Lake
Course took its toll on a number of players who were flirting with
the leaderboard on Thursday. Darkhorse Mark Carnevale, who started
Friday's round in second place at 3-under, double-bogeyed the
394-yard par-4 second hole and then bogeyed No. 4 to slip to even
par. The second hole also claimed Joe Durant, who had been tied
with Carnevale going into Friday's round, and the 10-year
journeyman pro from Pensacola, Fla., fell to 1-over by the end of
the day.
Course conditions also claimed many of the 20-something stars
who were counted on to do well in this Open.
Leonard, picked as one of the favorites to win the tournament in
a pre-Open poll, shot 75 to go with an opening round 71 and didn't
like being upstaged by the likes of Kuchar.
Fred Couples just barely made the cut after a 5-over 75 Friday
to put him at 147 for the tournament, as did 58-year-old Jack
Nicklaus, playing in his 42nd Open. Nicklaus, who got a special
exemption just to make the original field, needed a 50-foot birdie
putt on 18 to stay alive. Tiger Woods and Leonard also flirted with
elimination at 6-over 146, and Casey Martin qualified, one stroke
ahead of them. The list of those who headed home last night
included 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III, 1996 Open champ Steve
Jones, 1995 Open champ Corey Pavin, Tom Watson, Nick Faldo and
Fuzzy Zoeller.
Even when things were going well, Stewart knew his lead could be
squandered, given the severity of the Lake Course.
KOSOVO-REBELS (Junik, Serbia) War has a choreography that only
its participants understand. Fighters, locked in an embrace, feel
out the daily beat and rhythm until the set is shattered by a surge
of anarchic violence. Such a dance is underway in Kosovo, where
armed peasant farmers, joined by hundreds of rebels that have
picked up weapons and uniforms over the border in northern Albania,
face down some 50,000 government soldiers and special police. By
Chris Hedges.
CENTENARIANS (Phoenix) Centenarians aren't what they used to
be. There are so many between 30,000 and 50,000, according to
demographers, up from the 1980 estimate of 15,000 that it's hard
to get a televised 100th birthday greeting from Willard Scott, who
mentions 12 every week on the Today Show. Every week about 90 new
centenarians are disappointed. Centenarians are the country's
fastest growing age group, with projections that by the middle of
the next century more than 600,000 Americans will be over 100. By
Sara Rimer.
TEXMEX-BORDER (El Paso) Four years after the North American
Free Trade Agreement lowered trade barriers, the cities along
Texas' long border with Mexico are struggling to become more than
glorified truck stops for the free trade era, as they watch their
manufacturing jobs move south by the thousands. By Sam Howe
Verhovek.
CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) A curtain-raiser on the
appropriations process, which is finally under way in both houses,
with floor votes to start soon. These are the only bills Congress
must pass, so here's a look at what's in them, what are the likely
collisions, House vs. Senate and Congress vs. White House. By
Katharine Q. Seelye.
