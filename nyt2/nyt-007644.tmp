WASHINGTON As Congress counts down the weeks before it
adjourns for the November elections, the House and Senate are
getting down to the one task they are required to perform every
year passing the 13 spending bills that keep the government
running in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
The process is already showing the strains of the spending
limits imposed by the balanced-budget agreement that Congress
reached last year with the Clinton administration.
Even though experts are forecasting a budget surplus of as much
as $64 billion this year, lawmakers are constrained by strict
limits that raise the amount for day-to-day government operations
by only one percent over last year's levels, to about $533 billion.
But they also want to have something to brag about at home, and a
year of surpluses tempts many to reach into the treasury.
The dynamics are further complicated by various ideological
divides between House and Senate Republicans, between both houses
and the administration, and among House Republicans themselves.
This blurs a sense of priorities, particularly as lawmakers
continue to pursue their own pet projects and as Democrats seek to
portray the Republicans as in complete chaos.
There is no broad budget resolution to guide them, because the
House and Senate cannot agree on one. So lawmakers are using last
year's resolution as a map, recognizing that they may have to make
further cuts if a resolution is ever adopted. Beyond that, Congress
has already approved a massive highway bill that many members
believe has used up the little discretionary money they had.
Despite the unresolved conflicts, lawmakers must keep to a
timetable that will have them discussing a half-dozen bills on the
floors of both the House and Senate this week.
Obey said that while Republicans wanted to appear to be holding
the line on spending, they had privately sought out Livingston and
requested 7,000 items that would raise total spending by $278
million.
The tension between the two goals was threatening to disrupt the
House, but on Friday, House leaders quelled a mini-rebellion.
Both conservatives and moderates were worried about the
budget-busting potential of a $4 billion appropriation that Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Livingston had put toward solving the year 2000
computer problem, which could hobble the government at the end of
the millennium.
Livingston and Gingrich had cast the $4 billion as an emergency a designation that allows Congress to spend money without having
to seek equal cuts in some other program. But many members railed
at this as a gimmick.
