The father eventually was sent to prison for that crime, and
investigators took another look at the fatal fire. They determined
it was not an accident but arson.
This month, Romaneck won a $5.5 million judgment against the
city, claiming that police and fire officials were negligent in
their investigation of her sisters' deaths.
As a result of that negligence, her father, Eugene Keidel,
remained free and, she said, subjected her to years of abuse.
So the city agreed to a judgment in Romaneck's favor. The $5.5
million will be paid by the city's insurance carriers.
One of Romaneck's attorneys, Frank Verderame, said Thursday that
the key for Romaneck was having the city acknowledge the
negligence.
The disappearance of Dianne Keidel remained a mystery for 27
years, until Romaneck broke her silence and came forward with
shocking details.
In a letter mailed to Phoenix police, she wrote that she had
seen her father beat her mother on Sept. 17, 1966. Then she had
heard digging outside their west Phoenix house.
The year after the letter, in 1994, Eugene Keidel was arrested.
A jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, and he was
sentenced to life in prison.
The fire had occurred Jan. 9, 1967. Eugene Keidel told
investigators that he was not home at the time. He had gone to a
convenience store, bought a beer and then drank it while drying
clothes at a laundromat, he said.
The two surviving children were left in the care of Eugene
Keidel. Romaneck said that led to a childhood filled with terror years and years of physical and sexual abuse.
