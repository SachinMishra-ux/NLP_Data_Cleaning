A good suppressor should have been tested by Underwriters
Laboratories to let through no more than about 300 volts when it's
hit by a 6,000-volt power spike. This is called the UL 1449 rating be sure yours meets this standard. Of course you should buy a
suppressor with a lifetime insurance policy to pay for damages to
your computer. But that doesn't mean the device itself will last a
lifetime. Many surge suppressors use circuitry that loses its
protective power after a few years. It makes sense to buy new every
half-decade or so.
Surge boxes won't help during a brownout or blackout. For that,
you need an uninterruptible power supply. Once only used in
businesses, they've gotten cheap enough to consider for the home.
American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., lent me their
BackUPS Office product for a tryout. It looks like an overgrown
surge suppressor with six outlets and a heavy lead-acid battery
inside, but it gets the job done. I pulled the plug on my home PC
by way of a test. The battery drove the computer with two hard
drives, and a monitor and my Iomega Zip drive, for 12 minutes
before it gave up the ghost. That was plenty of time to do a safe
shutdown. The BackUPS Office sells for around $125. And there are
more expensive battery backup devices that come with software
that'll automatically shut down your machine during a blackout.
ATLANTA -- Technology is changing so rapidly, economist George
Gilder said Thursday, people buying the latest in personal
computers are still like cavemen tapping away in the dark.
Instead of boxes sitting on desktops, the personal computer of
tomorrow say, five years from now will be as small as
palm-sized cellular phones, but far more powerful and versatile
than today's PCs.
At least that's the view of Gilder, a Reagan-era economist
turned technology guru who spoke at Thursday's closing session of
Supercomm. The telecommunications and information conference at the
Georgia World Congress Center is scheduled to return to Atlanta
June 6-10, 1999.
Operating with the technology of a cellular phone, the
next-generation personal computers will have wireless Internet
access, Gilder said. Thus, even without access to a phone line,
people will be able to transmit electronic mail, read newspapers
and search the Web.
People will be able to write as they drive, using speech
recognition to talk into their computers rather than type on a
keyboard, Gilder said. Those who want to work at home or the office
can plug in their machines to electrical sockets and hook them up
to full-sized monitors.
These evolving technologies are available, for instance, as
mapping and speech-recognition software. But Gilder predicted
they'll become more reliable and affordable as manufacturers pump
billions of dollars into the potentially lucrative technologies.
Experts predict the Internet will increasingly perform those
tasks, with competition driving down costs for the rising number of
Internet users. One of the biggest roadblocks, Gilder said, is
federal regulations of emerging technologies.
