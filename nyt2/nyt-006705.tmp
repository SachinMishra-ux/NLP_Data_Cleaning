The fighting between the rebels, who want to make Kosovo a
separate state, and the government intensified in March after
Belgrade ordered special police units to crush the center of the
rebel operations in Drencia in central Kosovo. The attacks, which
leveled villages and killed more than 80 people, most of them
civilians, enraged a population that had been content to resist
Belgrade through peaceful means.
Milosevic, after promising U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke last
month that he would begin talks with ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova to stave off a threat of sanctions, stepped up his campaign
against the rebels earlier this month. His forces, for the first
time backed by army units, drove some 80,000 people from their
homes along the border with Albania and burned and shelled
villages. The drive was apparently intended to hamper the infusion
of fighters and war materiel into the country.
The latest attacks, which included heavy shelling, led the
Western alliance to threaten Milosevic with air strikes if he did
not withdraw his units, end the attacks and begin talks with Rugova
to return Kosovo's autonomy that was revoked eight years ago by
Belgrade.
The Yugoslav president, after a Moscow meeting on Tuesday with
President Boris Yeltsin, failed to accept the demands of the
so-called contact group, which includes Russia and five other major
powers, to withdraw his special units. The contact group was formed
to handle the crisis in Bosnia.
The tough stance by Belgrade has stiffened the resolve of the
ethnic Albanian leadership and moved it closer to endorsing armed
rebellion. The so-called government in exile for Kosovo Thursday
called on ethnic Albanian villagers in Kosovo to defend themselves
against Serb attacks. The statement, made in Tirana by the five
leading political parties, dealt another blow to Rugova's avowed
pacifism. The parties, however, did not endorse a request by the
KLA leadership to be declared the army of the government, ethnic
Albanian leaders said.
The show's framework is provided by a song Schwinn is composing
for a children's television show, which stars a man dressed as a
frog called Bungee. When Schwinn collapses into a plate of ziti
while lunching with his friend Rhoda (Liz Larsen), he has yet to
complete that song (it's about frogs in the springtime) and the
specter of unfinished work will haunt him throughout his ensuing
ordeal of examinations, surgery and recovery in the hospital.
Bungee (amusingly played by Chip Zien), or the fantasy version
of him, is an active presence in these scenes, tooling around on
his green bicycle and offering alternately chirpy and shrill bits
of wisdom. The use of the character is the show's freshest device,
and the frog-man figures prominently in Schwinn's climactic embrace
of childlike wonder. But the fact remains that Bungee is a
loathsome creature, and it would be far more gratifying to see him
strangled.
The evening is most persuasive when its subject is frustration.
The opening number, in which Schwinn is working with disdain and
exasperation on the Bungee song, is charming and funny; so, in a
creepier vein, is the spectacle of Schwinn's doctor (John Jellison)
delivering a muddled diagnosis with a mad-scientist fervor. And two
of Schwinn's hallucinations, respectively embodied by Ms. Larsen
and Michael Mandell, in a scene-stealing turn as a jocular nurse,
have a weird, compelling spikiness.
The production, the first to come out of Lincoln Center's
recently established workshop for new musicals, looks great, with a
set by the ever-inventive David Gallo that finds convincing visual
metaphors for the out-of-body experience. And the cast is
top-notch. Gets brings an amiable looseness to his part, a sort of
go-with-the-flow passivity that suits the material without seeming
shapeless. Penny Fuller, as Schwinn's mother, and Christopher
Innvar, as his lover, are appropriate mixtures of prickliness and
comfort. And the invaluable Mary Testa shows up as a homeless woman
who offers a downside philosophy of life that Schwinn must
incorporate (sort of) into his revitalized worldview.
