The first 14 of the Local Social Mediation Agents, or ALMS, as
they are called, began patrolling the network this week after a
four-week training course just in time for next week's start of
the World Cup soccer tournament.
If soccer brings with it hooliganism, as many fear, the agents,
men and women around the age of 20, will be in the front line.
A spokesman for the transit authority, the RATP, said the agents
had a dissuasive and mediating role rather than a repressive one.
If trouble breaks out, the unidentified agents can call on the
police for help. Their only weapon is the power of persuasion.
The volunteer Guardian Angels, who came to Paris in a
short-lived experiment a few years ago, are seen by many as
unlawful vigilantes although they claimed to have reduced crime in
New York.
The Paris agents on the other hand will carry an official
warrant jointly issued by the RATP and the Paris police, and will
work in close collaboration with the police.
They have been given instruction in public liberty, principles
of law and psychological training in dealing with problems ranging
from drunkenness to graffiti spraying. The RATP said they were also
expected to lend a helping hand to people who are lost or in
difficulty.
Polls show that a perceived lack of security is foremost among
the concerns of passengers. Metro employees have gone on strike
several times in recent months because of attacks against
co-workers, and the RATP spends tens of millions of francs cleaning
up trains defaced by vandals.
The agents are being hired under a government plan to create
jobs for young people, under which the government will pay up to 80
percent of their wages.
The RATP says it hopes to have 50 agents on duty by the end of
June, and 250 within three years.
The Metro network already employs specialized security officials
and dog-handlers in addition to transit policemen a total of
about 1,000 men and women.
