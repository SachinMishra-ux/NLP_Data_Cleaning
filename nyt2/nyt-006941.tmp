On the short but tricky 288-yard seventh, he nearly holed out,
leaving a wedge shot three inches from the cup. Tap-in birdie. On
the 609-yard 16th, he left an iron shot eight inches from the hole.
Another tap-in birdie.
On the 17th, a converted par-5 and Olympic's toughest hole,
Stewart launched a 2-iron out of the rough and onto the green. He
rammed in a 45-foot putt for birdie and wiggled his body in
celebration. On the 347-yard 18th, he curled in a 12-footer for
birdie, again escaping the rough off the tee. Playing
conservatively, he used his driver just three times.
His closest pursuer was another unlikely Open contender,
Carnevale, who shot a bogey-free 67. The stocky 38-year-old golfer
had struggled mightily this season, missing the cut in 10 of 15
events and finishing no higher than 41st at the Phoenix Open.
But he hung with Stewart. Even when the inevitable happened when he realized how much uncharted territory he had covered. He
has one tour victory to his name, the 1992 Chattanooga Classic. Not
exactly a major.
Daly, winner of the 1991 PGA Championship and 1995 British Open,
has forsaken his driver this week, a courageous move for a man
longer off the tee than anyone. He has turned to his 3-wood,
leaving him some 35 to 40 yards shorter than the norm and conceding
long drive stats and bonus money. He's not happy, but he's in
contention.
SEATTLE Bad as it might get for Paul Westphal next season combine the NBA labor dispute with a significant team rebuild, as
well as Gary Payton's mercurial temperament, and prospects are not
pretty it won't compare to the tub o' goo he found the first time
he replaced a local Sonic hero.
Westphal retains a souvenir from his unlamented Seattle season
of 1980-81, when he was traded from Phoenix for fellow All-Star
guard Dennis Johnson.
Two years after they won the NBA title, the Sonics fell to 34-48
and last in the Pacific Division the fastest, steepest fall for a
champion in NBA history. Along with leading scorer Gus Williams'
season-long contract holdout and forward Lonnie Shelton's broken
wrist after 14 games, Westphal's Sonic career lasted just 36 games
because of a foot injury.
Since he was a free agent after the season and left Seattle for
the New York Knicks, and since Johnson went on to stardom with the
Suns and Boston Celtics, including two championships, it can be
argued that Westphal was part of the worst trade in Seattle pro
sports history (remember, Brian Bosworth was a draft choice).
The Johnson trade ushered in a decade of mediocrity that didn't
end until Karl arrived in 1992. Now, after six years averaging
nearly 60 regular-season wins, the Sonics are at a crossroads
similar to the one two decades earlier on the backside of
success, striving to stay elite.
