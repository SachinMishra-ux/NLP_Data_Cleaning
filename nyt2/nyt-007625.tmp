LENS, France When it ended with Jurgen Klinsmann surrounded on
a stretcher and Lothar Matthaus alone in the record books, the
Germans were the happier team, but it was not because they had
beaten the Yugoslavs.
It was because they had done what German teams were doing long
before East and West came together. They had rousted themselves
from a funk and rallied: scoring two goals in the final 16 minutes
to salvage a 2-2 draw and preserve their share of first place in
Group F.
This was a gripping match, full of odd bounces and odd plot
twists, but once again in this World Cup, violence outside the
stadium shifted some of the focus off events inside the stadium. A
French policeman and a Brazilian reporter were injured seriously in
separate incidents involving Germans who were in Lens for the game.
The policeman reportedly was hit in the back of the head with an
iron bar and was hospitalized in critical condition.
Two German fans also were sentenced to short prison sentences
after clashing with police in Paris on June 15 before Germany
played its opening match against the United States.
The last team to play the Americans in this tournament will be
the Yugoslavs, who can be sure of advancing to the second round
with another draw. The Americans have no chance of advancing after
their emotional loss Sunday night against Iran.
The Germans actually pressed harder than the Yugoslavs at the
start Sunday, but they quickly lost their enthusiasm when Mijatovic
struck a ball with his right foot in the direction of the German
goal. His 19-year-old teammate Dejan Stankovic sprinted toward it,
one step ahead of Jeremies, the fleet German midfielder. Stankovic
extended his leg. The ball brushed past it, deflected off the knee
of disoriented German goalkeeper Andreas Kopke and ricocheted off
the far post, bouncing off Jeremies' upper chest into the goal.
Though Stankovic appeared to play more of a passive than active
role in that complicated process, the gifted teen-ager was awarded
his first and probably not last World Cup goal. The Yugoslavs were
on their way to dominating the opening half in style, and if not
for some fine saves from Kopke, they might have increased their
lead in a hurry.
At halftime, German coach Berti Vogts substituted 37-year-old
Lothar Matthaus for Dietmar Hamann in midfield. Matthaus was not
supposed to be part of this German team at age 37, but after star
sweeper Mathias Sammer was unable to recover from a series of
injuries, Vogts swallowed his pride and reached out to the
outspoken veteran he once had vowed would never play for him again.
Matthaus' appearance made him the first man to play in 22 games in
the World Cup finals and it drew him even with former Mexican
goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal, the only other player to appear in
five World Cup finals.
But drawing even with Yugoslavia, not Carbajal, was the more
urgent objective, and it didn't help Germany's chances when the
normally reliable Kopke mishandled a low, well-struck shot from
striker Darko Kovacevic. The ball slipped through his arms and
bounced in front of the charging Yugoslav captain Dejan Stankovic,
who joyfully gave his team a 2-0 lead in the 54th minute.
Vogts, thoroughly underwhelmed by his players' performance,
would substitute twice more, and in the 74th minute, one of those
substitutes, Michael Tarnat, unleashed a long free kick that
deflected off Mihajlovic's right leg and into the goal. Suddenly,
the urgency and intensity missing from Germany's play since the
opening minutes was back, and on a corner kick in the 80th minute,
Bierhoff rose high between two defenders and headed home the
equalizer.
