Three months. Six months. A year. It doesn't matter. A nun told
me, years ago, that we should only discard our bad habits. We don't
need another denomination that chooses economical over ecumeni cal.
We already have houses of worship called General Motors, Mi crosoft
and ATT.
Ella Mae Bleier said the parish did all it could for the nuns.
There are no bad guys in this conflict, she told me.
Maybe so. But, if the Lord really does speak through Father
Spauld ing, I hope He takes a moment soon to retell a story I first
heard from a nun. It's about a nice young couple and their baby
boy.
And how there was no room for them at the inn. E.J. Montini can be reached at 444-8978 or at ed.montini pni.com

But Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie and officials of the
National Thoroughbred Racing Association are already trying to
determine how the product can be improved next year.
Sellers kept his momentum going yesterday, too, riding Colcon to
a perfectly timed come-from-behind victory in the Locust Grove
Handicap at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., a $150,000 race.
The attendance of 16,156 for the All-Star competition was almost
1,000 more than last year, and betting was up, too. Lone Star fans
wagered nearly $700,000 just on the four All-Star races, and
out-of-town simulcast sites pumped in an extra $1.89 million.
The new All-Star Wager grossed only $109,000 in betting
nationwide, almost half of that at Lone Star, but the generous
payoffs almost guarantee it receives more attention next year. The
predictable $2 trifecta of Sellers, Julie Krone and Jerry Bailey
paid $670.60.
Next year, Johnsen says the local events surrounding the
All-Star evening could be bolstered, perhaps with a golf tournament
or an expanded luncheon. And someday, he said, a foreign jockey
such as Frankie Dettori or Texas native Cash Asmussen could be
invited to participate.
Mastery's Gamble, who three weeks ago at Lone Star breezed to a
6 3/4-length front-running victory at seven furlongs in the Two
Altazano Stakes, showed her heels to Texas-bred females again
yesterday going a mile.
