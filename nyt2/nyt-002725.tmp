There had been many sights a few hours earlier. There had been
the haunting sight of D. Wayne Lukas, once the best of the New
Guard, striding into the jammed Belmont paddock to saddle not one,
but two horses ... and Lukas was all alone. Then, when his saddling
chores were done, Lukas walked through the tunnel that connects the
paddock to the track itself, turned left, and headed to the owner's
box ... again all alone.
Then, of course, there had been the stirring sight of Real Quiet
having the Belmont won, only to see Victory Gallop bearing down on
him in the final 16th of a mile, and finally catching Real Quiet in
the stirring, final jump.
There even was a ludicrous sight of the press release from the
stewards' box and the stewards saying they would have disqualified
Real Quiet if he had finished a nose ahead of Victory Gallop, and
not a nose behind ... and virtually no one in racing believed a
Triple Crown winner would have been disqualified on what was, at
best, a 50-50 call.
But, most of all, there was the sight of long-comatose Belmont
Park teeming and throbbing and bursting with fans and excitement.
Most, of course, were there to see a Triple Crown that was not to
be, but many were there also because they were drawn to the track
by the fun-loving crew that surrounded Pegram and trainer Bob
Baffert, who were on more New York City newscasts than Rudy
Giuliani or George Pataki.
WASHINGTON From entrepreneurial darlings to evil monopolists,
from nerds in a garage to corporate titans, Intel and Microsoft
symbolize the technology industry, the fastest-growing segment of
the U.S. economy.
The Federal Trade Commission will meet today on whether to file
an antitrust suit against Intel, following on the heels of a
similar Justice Department action against Microsoft. Sources expect
the FTC to approve an action against the Santa Clara chip giant.
With these two historic antitrust cases, the federal government
is targeting the two companies that more than any other symbolize
the phenomenal growth and success of the high-tech industry.
The lawsuits mark a sea change in antitrust enforcement. After
nearly 16 years of relative quiet on the issue of big-firm
domination, the federal government has opened an aggressive attack
on the twin behemoths of America's most prominent industry.
The stakes are high. Should the lawsuits succeed, they will
impose rules and limits on an industry that has prided itself on
its freewheeling independence.
Reminiscent of decades-old antitrust cases against big oil and
big steel, these suits seek to rearrange the driveshaft of the U.S.
economy.
