In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest. POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS 
If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
