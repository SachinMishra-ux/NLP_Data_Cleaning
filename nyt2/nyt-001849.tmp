No one, however, is likely to rival Wynn, who has surfaced as
the most important art buyer in the world. He personally, and the
Mirage company he heads, have spent almost $300 million on art in
just a few months.
Among his acquisitions, some of which now decorate the Mirage
awaiting the completion of Bellagio, is Edgar Degas's `Dancer
Taking her Bow' (bought for $12 million), Picasso's `Seated Woman'
($1.65 million) and Alberto Giacometti's `Pointing Man' ($7.35
million).
In March, he paid $50 million for seven contemporary pieces by
artists such as Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Lichtenstein and
Cy Twombly.
David Nash, a former Sotheby's auctioneer and now a leading
dealer in New York, sees in Steve Wynn the same appetites displayed
by very wealthy men before him.
After some of the company's shareholders began to get restless
earlier this year, Wynn sold some of his shares in Mirage and began
to buy on his own account. He will lease back the pictures he has
bought to the Bellagio for display.
And then there is the question: can vulgar Vegas appreciate what
it is getting? Even to ask it raises the hackles of Alan Feldman, a
spokesman for Wynn, who instantly detects elitism and snobbery.
Lee Cagley, who is heading the design team recreating the
Peterhof at the Rio, believes he sees, meanwhile, a broad maturing
both of the city and of the punters coming to play in it.
Probably, though, only a tiny fraction of the punters will
notice the new rarification of the desert air.
Andrew, a waiter at Melange, calculates that the Picassos inside
go completely unnoticed by about half of the diners who come in.
And usually he does not disturb their ignorance.
NEW YORK Deepening the dissension at the Taxi and Limousine
Commission over Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's strict new taxi rules, two
commission members filed affidavits Thursday supporting a suit by
fleet owners against the commission and the mayor.
