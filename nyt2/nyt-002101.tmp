GM-FLINT A strike at a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint,
Mich. is the start of what could be a series of summer labor brawls
for the world's largest automaker. And it appears two GM brake

battlegrounds. (Wagner, Dayton Daily News) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

NIKE Retailers have tried many strategies to sell athletic
apparel. Stores have been decorated to look like locker rooms.
Photos of famous football and basketball stars have lined their
walls. Sporting events have been shown on in-store televisions. But
in many cases, women have received short shrift, despite the fact
that they are taking to the field, the pool and the track in
growing numbers. Footwear giant Nike Inc. has taken a step toward
changing this with its new Nike Women's Shops stores within a
store dedicated to women's shoes and apparel that were launched in
Maryland in April. The nation's fifth shop and its first in Texas will formally open in the month-old Finish Line Inc. athletic
superstore in Barton Creek Square mall today. (Austin
American-Statesman) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
FPL-RECORDS WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. Summer's not here yet, but
Florida Power Light has already set records for electricity use
throughout the state. FPL officials said customers are pumping up
air conditioning units and putting a noticeable but manageable
strain on their demand. Palm Beach County residents have been
dealing daily with almost record-high temperatures. With a
50-percent humidity level, the heat index, which is how hot it
feels when the humidity is considered, stayed just on this side of
100 degrees. (Colavecchio/Mnookin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
KETTERING, Ohio Rev. John Long has conducted hundreds of
wedding rehearsals in his 30-plus years in the ministry, but he
hopes none will go smoother than the one scheduled for today at Oak
Creek United Church of Christ in Kettering, Ohio.
Long will be among thousands of transplanted or traveling
Indians fans at Cinergy Field this weekend as the Reds host the
Indians in night games today (Friday June 5) and Saturday and a day
game Sunday. It will be the first time the Indians visit Cincinnati
for regular-season games.
The Saturday game is sold out, but 2,000 standing-room tickets
will go on sale at 5:05 p.m. Saturday at Cinergy. The Reds expect
total attendance for the series to surpass 140,000. The record for
a three-game series is 152,565, set against the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 1974.
Joining Long for tonight's pilgrimage will be his wife Shirley,
also a Cleveland native, and daughters Mary and Beth. Also going
are Dave Higgins, Beth's husband, their two children, Hannah and
Andrew, and Barbara Cassady, Shirley's cousin.
Maintaining ties to the Indians hasn't been easy for Dayton-area
residents, including Jim Dennis, an Oakwood attorney who moved here
from Cleveland in 1976, when the Big Red Machine was at its peak
and the Indians were in the midst of a decline that produced only
five winning seasons from 1967 to 1993.
