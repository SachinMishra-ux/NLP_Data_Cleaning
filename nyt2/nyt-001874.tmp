The only blemish on yesterday's events may have been the rain
that moved through the area about 7:30 p.m. and delayed qualifying
for tonight's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Pronto Auto Parts 400K race
for more than three hours and postponed the qualifying round for
tomorrow's Indy Racing League True Value 500K competition until
today.
Renovations began less than three weeks after the NASCAR Winston
Cup Texas 500 on April 5, which was marked by a major crash in Turn
1 and drivers' complaints about the transition at the exit of Turn
4 and entrance into Turn 1.
Dennis Huth, NASCAR vice president for administration, said
officials at the speedway will continue to listen as drivers come
off the track and give reviews throughout the weekend.
Less than a half-hour into yesterday's NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series opening practice, Barfield and his No. 35 Ortho Chevrolet
spun going into Turn 2. But he put all the blame for the crash on
himself.
But after their first practice session for tonight's Pronto Auto
Parts 400K, truck drivers followed Barfield in extolling the
track's new surface. Later yesterday afternoon, drivers of the
faster Indy Racing League cars, which race in tomorrow's True Value
500, also praised the track.
A new drainage system was installed after water seeped through
the pavement in Turn 1 during Texas 500 qualifying on April 3,
forcing postponement of the session until the next day.
NASCAR Craftsman Truck series defending champion Jack Sprague,
who pushed his truck to 176.062 mph by the second practice session,
said Texas Motor Speedway stands up to some of the more popular
tracks on the circuit.
BEIRUT In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians and a large number
of Israelis fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
