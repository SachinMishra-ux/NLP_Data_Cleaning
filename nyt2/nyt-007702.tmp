TIME-CNN-MEDIA (Undated) Doubts about the accuracy of a recent
article in Time magazine that was written by Cable News Network
journalists are serious enough that Time's editors have ordered a
further investigation. The article asserted that the U.S. military
dropped lethal nerve gas on a Laotian village in 1970, during the
Vietnam war, as part of a secret mission to kill American
defectors. By Lawrie Mifflin.
DIGICOM-COLUMN (Undated) In a climate where any regulation of
the Internet in its commercial infancy is considered high treason,
many law experts are dismayed at the tidal wave of restrictive
legislation governing everything from software filters to digital
copyrights and public-domain information being drafted and
enacted by states and the federal government. By Denise Caruso.
BERKSHIRE-MARKETPLACE (Undated) It could be Warren Buffett's
biggest challenge yet. Not the acquisition of General Re Corp., the
reinsurance giant that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy last
week for $21.7 billion in stock. Rather, his taking on the often
unruly Wall Street professionals who, as part of the deal, will
become holders of 15 percent of the shares of Berkshire Hathaway,
Buffett's far-flung corporate empire. By Edward Wyatt.
TAX-REFORM (Topeka, Kan.) The new way that taxes are collected
in this Midwest state capital may offer taxpayers everywhere a
glimpse of what the future may be like in dealing with the Internal
Revenue Service. By David Cay Johnston.
SAN FRANCISCO Tom Lehman had hoped, finally, to close the
circle that had opened here at Olympic in the 1987 U.S. Open. But
he didn't.
As Lee Janzen won the 98th Open Sunday, Lehman again emerged as
a sympathetic figure. He is now golf's version of the Buffalo
Bills, the team that lost four straight Super Bowls. Not that he
should be considered a loser. He won the 1996 British Open. But
four times in the last four years, he has been in the hunt going
into the last round of the U.S. Open.
In the last pairing with Payne Stewart Sunday, Lehman teed off
four shots behind. But he soared to a 75, tying for fifth after
finishing third, second and third the previous years.
By then Lehman realized that another 68 (which he shot in the
first and third rounds) would have edged Janzen's par 280 for the
trophy.
Nobody in golf knew him then. He was an assistant pro at Wood
Ranch near Los Angeles, after having earned a total of only $39,000
in three years on the PGA Tour. After qualifying for the Open, he
arrived at Olympic with Melissa, now his wife, along with his
brother Mike and his caddie, Buck Buchanan.
He didn't make the cut. The next year, the Lehmans took their
last $8,000 out of the bank to go to South Africa, where he
finished third in that nation's Open, a $20,000 payday. In 1990 he
joined the Hogan (now Nike) Tour, winning four times and emerging
as its leading money winner to qualify for the PGA Tour.
