Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized
corporation.The president will have his personal valet, for
instance, and Mrs. Clinton will bring her personal hairdresser.
Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
It isn't yet clear precisely how large the presidential
entourage to China will be, but some 800 people went along with
Clinton to Africa last spring, in addition to 200 journalists and
media technicians.
The China entourage is expected to be somewhat smaller though
the press contingent will be twice as large as it was in Africa largely because many of the American corporations that sent
executives on the Africa trip have representative offices in China.
The cost for members of the media accompanying the president is
expected to be about $15,000.
Secret Service protection is, of course, secret, though agents
sometimes take very public steps aimed at deterring would-be
assailants by showing the presence of a large and comprehensive
security effort.
When President Clinton visited the crime-ridden city of Cape
Town in South Africa last March, for instance, local security
agents, working hand-in-glove with the U.S. Secret Service,
canvassed the city and welded shut manhole covers along possible
routes of the presidential motorcade, closing off a possible avenue
of attack and also sending out the message that a tight security
net had been cast across the seaside city.
Ultimately, a presidential trip is global theater, scripted,
directed and managed to convey American priorities, as identified
by the White House.
Clinton hopes to use the China trip, for instance, to try to
redefine American impressions and to show that his policy of
engaging with China economically, politically and diplomatically,
is helping to foster change.
With that in mind, one of the first things Clinton plans to do
in China is to visit a small village named Xia He, characteristic
of hundreds of thousands of rural hamlets across the vast country
that are struggling to shift away from the old ways of a state-run
economy.
Largely by shifting to market-based economic practices, in
concert with opening up to foreign investment, tourism and trade,
China has seen perhaps half a billion of its people rise from the
depths of hardscrabble poverty over the past two decades.
