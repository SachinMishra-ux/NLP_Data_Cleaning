The big thing is the game of baseball is bigger and better than
anyone associated with the game. I can remember as a little boy,
one of the first bits of philosophy I've heard. It was: Baseball
has to be a great game to survive the people who run it.
Well, I can add to that. Baseball has to be a great game to
survive the people who play it. Basically the bottom line is, it is
a great game. And no matter what happens with the labor, with the
money, with the whatever, the game itself is pure enjoyment.
ATLANTA -- Kevin White and his 10-year-old daughter were looking
forward to a vacation to Disney World. But the computer installer
at a General Motors Corp.'s assembly plant had to cancel the trip.
He has the time, but not the money.
White left the plant yesterday with about 4,000 other United
Auto Workers who won't be on the job because of a lack of parts
from two striking plants in Flint, Mich.
By Thursday, 20 GM assembly lines in the United States, Canada
and Mexico had been idled or slowed by the strikes. An estimated 88
percent of the No. 1 automaker's North American production
capacity, about 20,000 vehicles a day, is now being lost, according
to CSM Forecasting.
While most GM dealers across the country still have several
weeks' supply of new vehicles on their lots, deliveries of new cars
and trucks have nearly ended as the strikes have dried up the
production pipeline. GM stock was down 18 3/4 cents to $69.56 1/4
Thursday.
If there weren't a strike going on, workers would receive
holiday pay for the first week of the shutdown and vacation pay for
the second, he said. To be eligible, they must have worked the
scheduled workday before that holiday. However, this year, that
looks unlikely.
While most workers asked said they support the strike in Flint,
their reactions to being out of work were mixed.
But not having an average steady paycheck, typically $500 a
week, is causing others to worry. After leaving his shift Thursday,
White went directly to a StaffMark, an employment agency handing
out flyers as workers streamed out of the plant gates.
Workers can file for unemployment benefits, up to $224 a week.
If denied, they can receive strike pay of $150 a week. Although
they are not on strike themselves, they will not receive
supplemental pay from GM, which normally is given during a layoff
period.
