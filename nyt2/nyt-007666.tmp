One of Ms. Taeuber's clients was Gabriel Jaime Castano, 28, a
Colombian immigrant who said he had no intention of seeking
political asylum when he arrived at Miami International Airport in
January with a visitor's visa. A farmer from near Medellin, Castano
said he had gone to Miami to escape his country's violence for a
few weeks. He was tired of paying off both the army and the
guerrillas with 20 live chickens a month to stay alive, he
said.
Immigration officers detained him because they did not believe
he intended only to visit, Castano said. After consulting with
lawyers there, he said he realized that asking for political asylum
would get him out of detention faster than sticking to his original
claim.
That tactic would probably not have worked in New York. When the
Wackenhut detention center fills up, asylum seekers are sent to a
detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., or to the York County Prison,
in York, Pa., said Mark Thorn, a spokesman from the INS office in
New York.
Judy Epstein, a spokeswoman from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society, said that one of the agency's clients a 20-year-old
woman from Ghana who has been detained for seven months was
recently transferred to Pennsylvania. The woman, Swaibatu Mohammed,
told the agency that five other women were moved with her.
In years to come, the INS intends to detain even more people as
it builds more detention facilities, said Bergeron. In doing so, he
said, the agency would be following the mandate of Congress, which
since 1996 has allocated $205.3 million to add 7,364 spaces to the
agency's current detention capacity and 882 positions to its
payroll.
Already, the INS has 15,000 beds in nine detention facilities,
prisons and an array of local jails around the country, an 80
percent increase from the number of beds available just three years
ago. Yet, Bergeron said, to accommodate all the people the law
mandates be detained those who seek entry into the United States
with no papers or with fraudulent documents the agency will have
to double its current detention capacity.
TEHRAN, Iran In a high-stakes political battle filled with
recriminations and rage, Iran's Parliament voted Sunday to dismiss
one of the closest allies of Mohammad Khatami, the reform-minded
president.
Parliament is controlled by Khatami's enemies. Its action Sunday
is the most serious political setback to his presidency since his
landslide victory 13 months ago as well as graphic proof of
Khatami's limited room for maneuver in Iran's Islamic Republic.
The vote came just three days after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warmly praised Khatami and the direction in which he seems
to be taking the country, and she held out the prospect of eventual
normalization of relations with Iran.
The vote, 137-117 with 11 abstentions, came in a secret ballot
after several hours of impassioned debate in which Noori was
accused of arrogantly dismissing officials who did not share his
politics, fostering an unstable economic environment and putting
the country's security at risk.
