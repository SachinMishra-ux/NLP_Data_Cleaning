His is a crucial job. Iran's emergence from the long, dark veil
of fundamentalism, a ongoing process not nearly finished, has been
exemplified by its success in soccer, and its reaction to that
success.
Its qualification for the World Cup, its first since 1978,
resulted in celebrations Khomeini never would have stood for, with
men drinking in public, women tossing aside their veils to kiss men
in the street, and a mass celebration in the national stadium that
included 5,000 women, who weren't permitted on the grounds.
Iranians, especially the young people, see the World Cup as a
chance to rejoin the world community, to show that they contrary to
widely held international beliefs are just like everyone else.
And if anyone embodies that concept, it is Talebi, 53, who was
forced to leave Iran when its war with Iraq, which began in 1980,
put an end to soccer in the country.
A little background: Talebi played for Iran's Olympic team in
Tokyo in 1964, and turned to coaching when a knee injury ended his
playing career. He was in charge of the Iranian Olympians prior to
the revolution, but found his skills no longer useful once the war
with Iraq began.
He took a job in the United Arab Emirates but didn't want his
children schooled in Arabic, so his family was sent to the United
States, to Palo Alto. He joined them in 1983 and has spent most of
the last 15 years there, taking off only for jobs with teams in
Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.
He also spent a spell at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills,
where Sampson played and served as an assistant coach. The men met
in 1994, through Bora Milutinovic, Talebi's close friend.
His wife, Sira, opened a vegetarian restaurant and a skin-care
business, and his eldest sons, Babak and Borzov, attended local
universities and took jobs in Silicon Valley. His youngest son,
Bardia, just graduated from Palo Alto High School, where he was a
soccer star. He wants to play at UCLA.

it. Author, futurist and physicist David Brin says we're hurtling
headlong into an era when everyone's life will soon be an open
