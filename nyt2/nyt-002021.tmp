But the film becomes most unnerving when Truman starts watching
us, when he finally realizes he's the object of unseen, cunning
eyes. It's not a sudden epiphany Weir's movie unspools gradually,
establishing the artifice of Truman's world before breaking it down
entirely. He, and we, see clues to the trickery around him: a tear
in the sky, a cloudburst that rains on him alone, a wedding
photograph in which his wife is crossing her fingers.
Carrey is an ideal match for Truman, because his raging comic
sensibility has always carried with it a hint of innocence there's
a childlike purity to his talent, a foolish abandon that recalls
Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp. And although he never meets his
maker, a cool media magnate played by Ed Harris, Truman is very
much a son in the biblical mold. He's Adam, maybe Isaac, possibly
Jesus. He is the created in a dance with his creator.
In 1928, the year Herbert Hoover whipped Al Smith for president
and made the world safe for Depression, an English physicist named
Paul A.M. (no doubt a morning-type of fellow) Dirac predicted the
existence of antimatter. 
For each particle of ordinary matter in the cosmos, he said,
like your electron and your proton and so forth, there is an
antiparticle with the same mass but with an opposite charge. (This
probably won't even make sense later, so don't worry about it
making sense now.) 
To be specific, Dirac said if there's an electron (which as
you surely remember from grammar school subatomic physics class carries a negative charge), the world's symmetry almost screams for
there to be a positively charged electron somewhere, which we now
know as a positron. 
The reason we know it as a positron now is that scientists have
produced it in laboratories (which makes you wonder what else
they're doing in there). 
Anyway, all these antimatter particles, in theory, could form
antimatter versions of visible matter. Which would mean antistars
(like Sean Penn?), antiplanets and even antihumans, several of
whom, I swear, are drive-through window clerks at some of the
fast-food restaurants I patronize. 
Some scientists theorize that there may be whole antigalaxies in
distant space. And that from these antigalaxies (or, anyway, from
some antiwhere) a few antimatter particles may get flung at Earth
from time to time. 
So they've sent up high-altitude balloons bearing detectors to
find them. And these detectors have turned up a few antiprotons
coming from cosmic rays. But, on the whole, the search has been
sort of disappointing. 
Now, however, a three-ton antimatter detector called the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer (its friends call it AMS, though had it been
up to me I'd have jiggled the letters so it could be SAM) is on a
shakedown cruise, preparing to spend 2002 to 2005 connected to the
new International Space Station.
