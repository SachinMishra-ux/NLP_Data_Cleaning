BOSTON On Sunday night, the New York Mets looked like a team
in a trance or a team anxious to return home after an 11-game road
trip or a team that could not see very clearly because the
persistent rain pelted 25 pairs of eyes. Actually, the Mets looked
like all of the above and worse while tumbling to the Boston Red
Sox 5-0.
It was the wrong night for the resurgent Mets to be featured
nationally on ESPN since Masato Yoshii lasted only five innings and
Steve Avery remember him? pitched his best game for Boston
against a lineup that was still without the injured Mike Piazza.
While Yoshii was abysmal mostly during a four-run third, New
York's hitters were dismal all evening against a pitcher who
entered the contest with a 6.41 earned run average. Who would have
expected the Mets to pulverize Pedro Martinez, the Cy Young award
winner in the National League last season, for four homers Friday
night and be mesmerized by Avery, who has three pinch-running
appearances listed as achievements for 1998?
But Avery won his third straight decision by baffling the Mets
with off-speed pitches and halting them on three hits in seven
innings as the Red Sox grabbed the final game of a three-game
interleague series. The Mets finished 7-4 on this trip.
Darren Lewis singled off the Green Monster in left, stole second
and scored when Reggie Jefferson rapped a 2-2 single to center.
After Nomar Garciaparra doubled on a 1-2 pitch and Mo Vaughn walked
to cram the bases, Troy O'Leary dribbled the third straight
two-strike pitch past a diving Carlos Baerga and into center to
score two more runs. John Valentin ended the two-strike streak by
blooping a 2-0 pitch into shallow right that doubled in Vaughn and
made it 4-0.
After the early onslought, the Mets had a chance to get back
into it when Brian McRae started the fourth by hammering a 400-foot
triple to center. But McRae, whose gyrations helped Tim Wakefield
balk in the only run in a 1-0 victory on Saturday, did not seem as
anxious to score on Sunday night. He did not try to come in on
Edgardo Alfonzo's smash to first, which caromed off Vaughn's glove
and rolled away from him. Bernard Gilkey's flyball reached medium
right, but McRae stopped running about halfway down the line. The
inning ended abruptly as John Olerud struck out and Scott Hatteberg
threw to second to catch Gilkey by 10 feet.
NEW YORK A 14-year-old girl was shot and killed at a friend's
apartment in Brooklyn early Sunday when a pistol being handled by
an adult discharged, the police said.
Investigators said they believed that the shooting was an
accident and that the man, who was being sought for questioning,
panicked and fled.
The girl, Selena Slade, a resident of Bushwick, Brooklyn, was
listening to music in a friend's apartment at 1145 Lenox Rd. in
Brownsville just after midnight when she was shot in the chest by a
man who had started handling a pistol, said Officer Leslie Cardona,
a police spokeswoman.
