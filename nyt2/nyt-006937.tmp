The hospital plans to set up a first-aid station near the
gathering to care for minor injuries, he added.
A large meadow near Carnero Lake will serve as the main
gathering site. On July 4, the group will remain silent until noon,
than gather in a massive circle to pray for world peace.
But now, most of the 500 to 600 early arrivals are concentrated
about a mile from the meadow in a ramshackle parking lot that
resembles a graveyard for buses. The Rainbows, whose bond is
non-violence and an aversion to commercial and government
bureaucracy, have been gathering since 1972. Inside a gathering,
eccentricity is commonplace.

CHINA-MIDDLECLASS (Beijing) Like a phoenix rising from the
ashes of communism, the last few years have seen the a stunning
growth of a flourishing Chinese middle class. Ten years ago, this
group did not even exist. Today its core of independent businessmen
has been joined by a growing number of private-sector lawyers,
artists and employees of joint-venture companies. It is first
defined by what its members have: computers, microwaves, interior
decorators and increasingly, cars and homes. But the rapid
accumulation of material things has left its psychological mark as
well, infusing this group with a kind of independence, and carefree
optimism, that has not existed in China for decades. By Elisabeth
Rosenthal.
