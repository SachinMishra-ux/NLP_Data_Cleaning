He also could accept an optional assignment; players with five
years experience first must agree to such a move. But because
Wohlers is 28 and above the rookie-league minimum, he could not
appear in Gulf Coast competition. Guy Hansen, the Braves' special
assistant for scouting and player development, will join him on
Monday.
The assignment is open-ended, and no determination has been made
when Wohlers (0-1, 8-for-8 in save chances, 5.06 ERA) might rejoin
the team. If rumors about his future with the club were moving
before Thursday, they will be flying now.
ATLANTA -- Unless the Scottish Rite Festival expands the annual
Georgia-Florida All-Star Football Game to include a basketball game
or another interstate football game, Florida may choose not to
return to Atlanta after 1999, when the current three-year deal
expires.
Florida Athletic Coaches Association executive director Wink
Barnette said his organization agreed to the pact with the
understanding that Scottish Rite would add a Georgia-Florida
All-Star basketball game and bring football all-star teams from
Tennessee and either Kentucky or Alabama to form a doubleheader.
SAN DIEGO -- Chad Smith's got a pierced eyebrow, a tongue ring
and furry spotted pants that are available from his
alternative-clothing company, Vinyl Boy.
Oh, and he can skate, too, which got him into the ESPN X Games
this weekend. But it's the look that will get him on TV. Air time,
it seems, is an even bigger deal than the $10,000 purse in his
event.
Bogus? Maybe. That's the X Games part sport, part made-for-TV
entertainment tailored for the generation it's named for.
No one agrees more than Derek Downing of Cumming, who has won
the downhill in-line twice in the three-year X Games history. He's
enjoyed a few perks, like seeing his trophies displayed at the
All-Star Cafe. But in terms of exposure, his friend Smith has him
beat.
The prize money, three times larger than what's offered at most
pro skating events, ensures a competitive field even though
skaters don't take these kind of risks any other time all year.
Most in-line races are distance events on flatter terrain.
The format, cameras and hype have stamped the X Games as
made-for-TV, a label that makes organizers bristle. Out of the
extreme sports culture, they say, have emerged personalities that
cannot be ignored.
