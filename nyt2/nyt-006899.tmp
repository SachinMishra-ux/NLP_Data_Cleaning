NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing maybe cutting the throats of the 10 percent Serb minority.
Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu Kashmir from seceding?
All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
