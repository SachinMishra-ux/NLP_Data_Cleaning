High-tech equipment is, however, putting demand on courses.
Augusta National, for example, announced last week significant
changes to four holes (Nos. 2, 11, 15 and 17) in an effort to
reward accuracy over distance.
Distance is the number one advantage high-tech equipment offers.
Although oversized, long-shafted titanium drivers might mean just a
few extra yards for some golfers, most pros say they gain an extra
15-20 yards. Golf balls are going farther on their own, too,
although how much is up for debate. There's no denying, however,
the fact that the PGA Tour's average driving distance keeps going
up every year.
And so do golf equipment sales. Golfers spent $2.5 billion on
equipment last year, which explains why Callaway and other
manufacturers are worried about even the slight hint of a ban.
WASHINGTON For the first time, an energy technology called a
fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another
sign that fuel cells are on the verge of acceptance as an
economical alternative to traditional energy sources.
The idea of fuel cells which convert liquid fuel into
electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel
cells were so expensive that it was practical only for NASA's
specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now
are powerful, flexible and reliable enough to work as an affordable
earth-bound energy source.
On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut off the electricity
the local utility company provides to a brick ranch-style house in
Latham, N.Y., and switch on a back-porch component that looks more
like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical
plant it really is.
Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial
sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department
of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first
street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at
Humboldt State University in California). And in April, Ford put
$420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in
Vancouver, B.C., in which Daimler-Benz already has a major
investment.
Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for
the test in Latham, say they have high hopes that within a few
years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel
cells powered by natural gas or propane, cutting pollution and
consuming less fuel than conventional energy production.
What has made fuel cells more practical has been improvements in
the gossamer-thin components, which look like plastic food wrap or
aluminum foil, that are used to turn a basic chemical reaction the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water into the
basis of an energy revolution.
The heart of the fuel cell being used in house in Latham and
being studied for use in automobiles is called a proton-exchange
membrane. When a hydrogen atom one proton and one electron is
pressed against that membrane, the proton passes through and the
electron is left behind. That creates a positive charge on one side
of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them
together, and the result is a flow of electricity.
