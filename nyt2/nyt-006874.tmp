In that September 1990 incident, according to the court papers,
Livoti was arresting a man, Ivan Cruz, and twisting his arm behind
his back when a second man, Manuel Bordoy, approached and told
Livoti that he was being unnecessarily rough. The two men were
returning home to the Bronx from a nightclub in Manhattan.
According to the government's account which Livoti denies he
then punched Bordoy twice in the face, breaking his jaw in three
places.
CLEVELAND As he decides how to approach the appeal of his
five-game suspension, Mike Stanton may have to choose between
honoring his principles and doing what is most advantageous for the
New York Yankees.
Gene Budig, the American League president, imposed a five-game
suspension and $1,000 fine on Stanton, contending that he purposely
hit Baltimore's Eric Davis with a pitch on Monday.
Stanton adamantly denies he did anything of the sort, and he
says that he intends to aggressively appeal the suspension, which
is scheduled to begin Wednesday.
Stanton wants to establish all the way through the process that
he disagrees strongly with the decision, and that he did not target
Davis. And there is always the chance that Budig will reduce the
penalty once he meets with Stanton.
On the other hand, Stanton could take the same approach that
Darryl Strawberry and Graeme Lloyd did last month and try to time
the suspension so that it leaves the Yankees in the best possible
competitive situation.
It would best suit the Yankees if Stanton remained available for
the four-game series with Cleveland that started Thursday night,
and for as many games as possible in the four-game series to be
played against the Atlanta Braves next week; Stanton is
left-handed, and the Indians and the Braves are loaded with
left-handed hitters, from Cleveland's Jim Thome and David Justice
to Atlanta's Ryan Klesko and Michael Tucker.
Looking ahead further, the Mets, who will play host to the
Yankees from June 26 to 28, have just one front-line left-handed
hitter, John Olerud. On the face of it, the Yankees would be best
served if Stanton could serve the bulk of his suspension while the
team plays at Shea Stadium.
But he is torn. He wants to make a stand, an opportunity to
present his perspective to Budig.
