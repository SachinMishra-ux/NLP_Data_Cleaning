Still, Selig obviously has misgivings. In a recent interview,
Selig, 63, said the last five years have been draining on his
family. His commitment to a new Milwaukee stadium, now under
construction, doesn't end until the facility is completed. And he
has just become a grandfather. The next scheduled owners' meeting
is Sept. 15-17 in Milwaukee, so Selig still has time to mull his
decision.
The latest call for Selig merely reflects the relative
confidence his fellow owners have in the onetime car dealer from
Milwaukee who rose from relative obscurity in the 1970s to become
perhaps baseball's most powerful owner. Not the richest. Not the
CEO of the biggest and best franchise. But a little guy from the
Midwest who since reestablishing a franchise in Milwaukee in 1970
has somehow managed to hang in with the big boys despite the
changing economic conditions.
It took three court losses on charges of collusion to expose the
commissioner's office as nothing but an extension of ownership.
Vincent was forced out because he dared exercise independent
judgment at a time when ownership wanted a strong front on such
matters as expansion, realignment, and interleague play. Vincent's
departure was baseball's loss.
In his place, ownership turned to Selig and a ruling Executive
Council, which carried the owners' banner on the aforementioned
issues. In appointing Selig, ownership did give the appearance of a
united front. But catastrophic confrontation with the union
followed, and the result was the players' strike of 1994 that wiped
out the World Series and wasn't resolved until the following
spring.
SAN FRANCISCO Casey Martin parked his shiny green golf cart
about 20 yards in front of the green on the 438-yard fourth hole at
the Olympic Club Thursday, then limped up the slope and stared
toward the rough that resembled bunches of broccoli on a produce
stand.
Several people in his gallery pointed to the little blue flag
marker near his ball, barely visible deep down in the broccoli. So
deep that he had to chip out firmly, his ball sliding about five
feet past the cup.
But on the 437-yard sixth hole, Martin rolled in a 20-foot putt
for the first Open birdie for the first golfer to play in a U.S.
Open while riding in a cart between shots.
About an hour before his midafternoon tee time, Martin emerged
from the men's locker room, where he has mingled with the best
touring pros for the first time.
Martin acknowledged, however, that some golfers' comments have
hurt as much as the circulatory ailment in his right leg known as
Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome.
Martin rebutted those who feel that walking is a test of the
fatigue factor in tournament golf.
