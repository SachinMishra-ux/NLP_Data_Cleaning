Even someone with as fertile an imagination as Brin admits to
being a little unsettled by the speed at which technology is
pushing an intrusive nose into people's private lives.
Consider, for instance, the Transient Electronic Pulse Emanation
Surveillance Technology, a system already in use that enables
electronic sensors to record the contents of any computer screen through walls if it's necessary up to a half-mile away.
Over the years, science fiction writers have tended to see the
proliferation of privacy-threatening technologies in Orwellian
terms more tools for Big Brother to keep ordinary people under
the thumb. But where others see oppression, Brin sees
opportunities.
If high-tech marketers want to profile your spending habits, he
says, insist that you have access to their records as well. If
highway patrolmen carry video cameras to record their arrests,
maybe motorists should too. If Big Brother wants to watch, demand
the right to watch the watchers free access for all to
information.
In some cities, for instance, residents are recording the
activities of prostitutes in an effort to discourage them from
working their neighborhoods. Megan's Law, the federally mandated
register of sexual offenders, enables police and local residents
alike to identify potential child molesters living in their
neighborhoods. Environmental Protection Agency regulations now make
data on local sources of toxic waste available, too.
New information technology can also help make governments more
accountable. The Internal Revenue Service now uses supervision
software to ensure that its employees do not browse through tax
returns they have no official business seeing.
Brin says a brave new world of electronic vigilantes is bound to
conflict with individual needs for freedom and privacy. Human
nature makes it inevitable.
ATLANTA -- Back when I was a kid, the arrival of my Uncle Bill
at our house was a great event.
He lived in Alaska and to folks living in Arkadelphia, Ark. that was every bit as exotic as if he were a permanent resident of
Mars or Paris, France ... both places seemed about as far away.
The house was cleaned, we stocked up on the sort of food we
usually ate on Sundays, and my brother and I got new blue jeans.
