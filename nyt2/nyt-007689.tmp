SAN FRANCISCO A few moments after realizing he had won the
U.S. Open Sunday, Lee Janzen wept. Who could blame him? The last
four days at the Olympic Club had been emotional, grueling and
relentlessly challenging, so difficult that nobody finished the
tournament under par.
Even after Janzen made a phenomenal charge he trailed by seven
strokes after the first three holes Sunday, and made four birdies
over the final 14 holes the torture was not over. He had to sit
helplessly and wait in the clubhouse as Payne Stewart lined up a
20-foot birdie attempt at No. 18. If the putt had fallen, Janzen
and Stewart would have played an 18-hole playoff Monday. For
Janzen, a Monday playoff would have at least have been better than
sudden death Sunday. After his final round, Janzen's knees were
weak.
He didn't have to. Stewart, who led for three days only to fall
agonizingly short, barely missed his putt for birdie at No. 18. It
broke right to left and slid just a few inches in front of the
hole, closing the door on Stewart and starting the tears for
Janzen. As he was hugged by his wife, Beverly, Janzen could finally
exhale. For the second time in his career, he was a U.S. Open
champion, adding to his 1993 championship at Baltusrol and taking
home the first-place check of $535,000.
Considering the circumstances, the comeback and the difficult
course on which he prevailed, this one-stroke victory was the
sweetest of Janzen's career.
It was a crushing defeat for Stewart, the 1991 Open champion,
who led after each of the first three rounds and who still led by
five strokes after his first three holes Sunday. But few
final-round leads are safe at Olympic, the same course where Arnold
Palmer lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper
during the 1966 Open.
Stewart shot his worst round of the tournament Sunday (74), and
after his birdie attempt on No. 18 missed, he admitted that he did
not play well enough to win. It was a familiar feeling for Stewart,
who also finished second to Janzen in the 1993 Open.
As Janzen was walking back to take another tee shot, which would
have also cost him a penalty stroke, the ball dropped out of the
tree. Janzen returned to his ball, then, after reaching the back of
the green in three shots, chipped in from about 20 feet to save
par. And he felt the momentum might be changing.
Meanwhile, Stewart was faltering. He bogeyed No. 4 and No. 7,
making the turn for the back nine at just 1 under par for the
tournament. Then when Janzen birdied No. 11 and No. 13 to pull to
even par for the tournament, Stewart had only a one-stroke lead.
Things got worse for Stewart at No. 12, when his tee shot landed in
a fairway sand divot. Stewart said he had always felt that a player
who hits in a sand divot should be given a free drop, instead of
playing the ball from the divot.
When Stewart bogeyed No. 13, Janzen had the lead for the first
time in the tournament. But Stewart responded with a birdie at No.
14 to even the tournament again. By this time, Tway and Tom Lehman,
who finished tied for fifth at 286, had already fallen out of
contention, while Nick Price, who finished fourth at 285, never
made a charge. It was a two-man race between Stewart and Janzen.
And Stewart made his final costly mistake, a bogey at the par-5 No.
16 to fall one stroke back, when he hit his third shot into a
bunker, chipped to 15 feet and then missed the putt.
Meanwhile, shortly before Stewart finished at No. 16, Janzen
made a crucial par at the treacherous 17th hole, a hole that Janzen
double-bogeyed on both Friday and Saturday.
