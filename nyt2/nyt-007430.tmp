Over the years, in a sport where loyalty to individual drivers
possesses a certain cult quality, Dale Earnhardt has played the
role of champion and villain, as have Bill Elliott and Darrell
Waltrip.
Jeff Gordon, who who is the pole-sitter for the Pocono 500 on
Sunday, is the latest driver to live out this weird dual existence the best and the booed.
Gordon's accomplishments on the track two NASCAR championships
in the last three years, 32 career triumphs are unmatched. His
earnings are unrivaled. And so his detractors are legion. Not
surprisingly, then, his misfortunes also now tend to be colored by
intrigue.
Two weeks ago, Gordon was leading a race in Richmond when he was
crashed into from behind and was unable to finish the race, much to
the delight of the fans who stood and cheered wildly as Gordon's
smoking car skidded to a stop.
A week ago, he raced to a nearly insurmountable lead at the
Michigan Speedway when a driver tossed something out his window and
onto the track, forcing a caution and costing Gordon his lead and,
ultimately, the race.
Is it a coincidence? Maybe. Is it the result of a design driven
by dislike or jealousy? Maybe.
Indeed, it is not unreasonable to wonder if anyone has ever felt
the sting of being a hated virtuoso more acutely than Gordon. In a
sport that began as recreation for moonshiners running liquor
across the South, Gordon stands out as unusual.
Gordon's resume is not standard issue. He is a middle-class kid
from California who moved to Indiana as a teen-ager. He is 26 years
old and never really had to pay the dues that other drivers did
(Earnhardt didn't start driving on the NASCAR circuit until he was
28). He is glib and does not speak with an accent, whereas many of
the drivers have a Southern drawl. He has the face and personality
of a Boy Scout, rather than a roughneck.
And perhaps most important, Gordon has ascended to the top of
the racing world just as the sport has begun to expand its reach
and reap greater economic reward finding popularity among a
wider, wealthier population, acquiring an appeal as a marketing
engine for nontraditional sponsors and paying its champions
millions instead of thousands.
Gordon is the face of that expanding NASCAR universe. With a
wife who pins scripture verses to his dashboard, Gordon is the
sport's singular talent and greatest marketing vehicle. Last year
he made $6.5 million in endorsements, promoting, among other
things, milk and toothpaste.
