Many observers believed Scheck had done a pretty good job
raising questions about whether the baby had died of a fresh
injury, as prosecutors insisted. The prosecution was hardly
confident of a murder conviction. Reilly's assistants offered to
give the jury the option of finding Woodward guilty of
manslaughter. The defense, sensing an acquittal, refused.
After the jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder, with
a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison, Scheck, Silverglate and
fellow defender Andrew Good met the media with the washed-out,
almost tearful faces of a baseball team having just lost the World
Series. They accepted responsibility for the failure to allow the
jury to consider manslaughter, and insisted that Woodward should
not be made to pay for their error.
Enter Judge Hiller B. Zobel, the veteran jurist known for his
willingness to go against convention. Eleven days after the jury
announced its decision, Zobel exercised a seldom-invoked judicial
prerogative to reduce Woodward's conviction to manslaughter, and to
limit her sentence to time served.
Did the widespread media coverage of public sympathy for
Woodward embolden Zobel to take such an unusual step? If so, that
by itself suggests that television is influencing the rendering of
justice.
In terms of better training for those who care for children,
yes. Philip Johnson, president of EF Au Pair, says the case
transformed his business, which oversees 4,000 foreigners working
in American homes. Standards are tougher: All au pairs now undergo
personality tests, and must document 200 hours of infant care.
Training now includes eight hours of instruction in coping with
children under age 2. The Massachusetts Legislature is considering
a bill to raise the weekly stipend for au pairs to $187. Still, the
number of British girls seeking placements plunged by about a half.
There is some indication that, after viewers digest an
especially filling case, reason supersedes emotion. In
Massachusetts, Woodward served as one bookend to another hugely
publicized case, the murder of Jeffrey Curley, the Cambridge boy
lured by his killers with the promise of a bicycle.
If the Curley case persuaded some skeptics that there are, in
fact, crimes so heinous as to justify the death penalty, the
Woodward trial, which knocked Curley off the front page, argued in
return that life-and-death decisions ought not be entrusted to the
legal system.
Brides and grooms get so much advice most of it wrong that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper i.e., tacky.
Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
