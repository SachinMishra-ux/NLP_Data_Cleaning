However, neither case turns on classic antitrust issues, such as
predatory pricing. Instead, Intel and Microsoft appear to have
drawn the government's attention because smaller players had
complained about the two giants' dominance in their markets.
Since the mid-1970s, antitrust action against dominant firms had
been in full retreat, led by University of Chicago economists who
argued that the goal of antitrust should be to protect consumers,
not competitors.
By 1982, the Reagan administration virtually eliminated
dominant-firm cases; antitrust efforts were refocused on
anti-competitive mergers, collusion and criminal activity such as
bid-rigging and price-fixing.
A major exception was the 1984 breakup of ATT; the
administration argued, however, that ATT was more like a monopoly
created by government regulation than one derived by efficiency;
even as ATT's divestiture was announced, the Justice Department
dropped its 13-year antitrust case against IBM.
Although the Bush administration actually initiated the
investigation against Microsoft, dominant-firm antitrust action
began its real resurgence under President Clinton, with cases
against the mergers of Office Depot and Staples, and Lockheed and
Northrop, for example.
But politics are hardly all-explaining. Microsoft's critics and
defenders straddle the ideological map. Former judge Robert Bork,
whose 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox did much to lead the
antitrust retreat, is now heading the intellectual attack on
Microsoft. And Sen. Patty Murray, a liberal Democrat from
Microsoft's home state of Washington, is among the company's
staunchest defenders.
One reason for the revival of antitrust zeal, some say, is that
the cute little baby high tech firms of 1980s have grown into big
ugly giants. They and their founders dominate the Information Age
like the robber barons did the Industrial Revolution: Bill Gates
and Microsoft are today's version of John D. Rockefeller and
Standard Oil.
Some say it is high tech's greatest asset innovation that
makes it an antitrust target. Fierce global competition in mature
industries offers no room for monopolies in things like chemicals,
steel, automobiles and machinery.
A taste of this came with a recent appellate court decision
favoring Microsoft in which the government alleged that the company
violated the 1994 consent decree by bundling its Internet browser
with Windows 95.
Similarly, the FTC's anticipated case against Intel appears to
be quite narrow. It is expected to focus on whether the
market-leading chip firm had a right to withhold design information
on upcoming chips from companies that sued it for patent
infringement.
