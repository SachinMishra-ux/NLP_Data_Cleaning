Pastrana has not ruled out a settlement that would incorporate
the rebels into the government, allowing them political control of
areas they already control on the ground. Under such an agreement,
the government would eventually end fumigation of drug crops,
holding the rebels responsible for eliminating drug crops in their
areas. Pastrana has proposed an international aid plan to support
alternative development in coca growing regions as well.
The mood in Bogota was festive and energetic on Sunday, with
cars festooned with posters and stickers for the candidates
careening through down the avenues and taking over street corners.
Youngsters painted their faces in the red, blue and yellow of the
Colombian flag and waved flags from car windows.
At scattered stoplights around the city, the supporters for
Pastrana exhorted drivers to vote for their candidate, while across
the street, supporters of Serpa shouted the praises of their man.
At polling places from the working class district of South
Candelaria to the toney outdoor polling stations in northern
Bogota, voters appeared divided, and none too pleased with either
of the candidates.
Jorge Ramirez, a 46-year-old businessman, stood with his dog
outside the room where he would vote. He said he could not decide
for whom to vote and listed his country's troubles.
In the poorer neighborhoods, Pastrana, the son of former
President Misael Pastrana, was frequently resented for his
political pedigree, while Serpa was embraced for having risen above
his working class background in the oil port of Barrancabermeja.
But those aspiring to the middle class, holding management jobs or
owning their own businesses, appeared to favor Pastrana.
LYON, France They never saw themselves going out this way. Not
with a whistle blowing and scarlet-clad Iranians leaping off the
bench and hugging and kissing and weeping and thanking the heavens.
Not with one match left to play. Not two-and-out.
Four years ago, when less was expected, the Yanks had
overachieved. They had made it to the second round and lost by one
goal to eventual champion Brazil. The draw was tougher this time
and they were playing overseas and yet ...
They never thought they would lose last night. Iran had not been
to a World Cup in 20 years. The sport had gone moribund there for
nearly a decade after the Islamic revolution and during the war
with Iraq.
Not that the Americans ever thought it would be easy. They knew
how much beating Uncle Sam meant back in Tehran. They knew the
Iranians would play themselves into the ground. But the Americans
thought that if they loaded their lineup with attackers and kept
coming, coming, coming, they would win.
