A rating of five signified mild recession, isolated food, fuel
and power shortages, disruption of transport services such as
trucking and air travel and runs on banks. Some people, however,
fear it will be much worse.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
told a recent conference organized by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington that there was a 60 percent
chance of a severe global recession and that Wall Street could fall
by 30 percent next year.
Much will depend on how far governments and private businesses
succeed in defusing the time bomb over the next 18 months. Nobody,
however, believes that all the errors will be corrected not even
in the United States, which leads the world in tackling the
problem.
Most other countries are far behind. Instead of giving priority
to the millennium bug, Asia is largely focusing on resolving its
financial crisis and Europe on introducing its single currency, the
euro. Many developing countries are hardly aware of the danger.
Even companies and government departments that think they have
made the necessary technical adjustments will be vulnerable to
disruptions if their suppliers and other contacts have failed to do
so.
One does not have to believe the most extreme scenarios to take
the sensible precautions most experts now recommend. Businesses,
for instance, should assign top managers, not just technical
experts, to the problem, draw up contingency plans for coping with
systems failures and postpone complicated operations like
accounting changes.
Much of the same applies to governments, which have the added
responsibility for heading off military disasters, such as might be
caused, for example, by false warnings of nuclear missile attacks.
Above all, political leaders urgently need to explain the risks
and activate coordinated responses. In the United States, there is
widespread amazement at the silence of Vice President Al Gore, the
administration's top computer geek, whose bid for the presidency in
the 2000 elections could be at stake.
There is no need to take to the hills, as some survivalists are
urging. But the Central Intelligence Agency is advising its
employees to pay their bills early in December 1999, keep cash on
hand and lay in extra blankets.
And many people, whether they are superstitious or not, probably
won't want to be in a plane as the millennium dawns. (To publish this 650-word article from the International Herald
