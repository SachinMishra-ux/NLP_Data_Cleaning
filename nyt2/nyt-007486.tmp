It is too soon to say whether there will be much of a demand in
the business world to locate at the test site. However, Carlson
explained that his goals in marketing the base were fairly modest.
Most of them didn't know a blue line from a stretch mark. They
didn't know if Mike Eruzione was the team captain or the kid who
delivered the pizza.
Thus, when a team of overachieving U.S. college kids upset the
mighty Soviet Union in the Olympics semifinals in Lake Placid,
N.Y., people across America cheered and hugged one another with
pride. Hockey had a golden page to add to its memory book.
Alas, today in Lyon, France, the World Cup soccer match between
the United States and Iran will kindle interest, but it lacks the
relative drama of that night in Lake Placid.
From a Biblical standpoint certainly, from this corner of the
globe the match is not like David and Goliath. It's more like
cold-shouldered Cains and Abels.
Thus, to ask this team of U.S. soccer players, who fight a daily
battle for recognition on their own, to shoulder the country's
political pride seems grossly unkind.
There will be no banners, Lyon's gendarmes have decreed.
Security has been stepped up around town. Effigies of Jimmy Carter,
we also assume, will not be gassed and burned.
If the Olympics has taught us anything in 2,000 years, it's that
sports and politics have always been intermingled. Jesse Owens and
Hitler in Berlin. The bloody Hungary and Soviet Union water polo
match in Melbourne. The boycott in Moscow, and again in Los
Angeles.
In a perfect world, the only storyline today would be whether
Stewart or surfer-dude teammate Frankie Hejduk can muster scoring
chances against Iran's Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh.
Millions of Americans will be watching today. To them, Team
Satan has a score to settle.
