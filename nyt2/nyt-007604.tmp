Moral of the story: Honor your heritage but welcome other
cultural traditions. And never trust a blond, 'cause he'll only

Snow White, eat my dust: She's more interested in what's right
for her people and her land than in landing a boyfriend; in a
Disney first, she doesn't get the guy.
Her look: Tomboyish as a bride in training, but brawny as a
soldier (thanks to padded armor and a haircut).
Her personality: Yearning to save her family's honor and her
father's life by proving herself a worthy fighter.
Moral of the story: Sometimes you have to break rules to do what
you know is right.
Snow White, eat my dust: Can you see Snow in armor, shooting a
cannon and kicking Hun butt? No, I don't think so.

go on stage at Comedy Store. Got noticed by a Hollywood agent.
Then the rubber glove question comes up and there's a pause a
long, uncomfortable silence that feels like all the oxygen is being
sucked out of the room Mandel's in even though he's 2,000 miles
away.

put a rubber glove on his head, blow real hard and inflate it like
a balloon. Big laughs then. Not so funny now.

Bonaduce?), and only a handful of hosts have done it very well or
very long.
