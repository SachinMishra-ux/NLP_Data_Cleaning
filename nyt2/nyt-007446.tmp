Frankie Hejduk, the world's fastest surfer, will certainly
replace Mike Burns at right wing. Ramos could also replace the
invisible Ernie Stewart as an attacking midfielder. The coach is
holding his intended lineup like a poker hand, revealing nothing.
But some believe Sampson may push David Regis into midfield and
start Lalas as a marking back to counter Iran's imposing
6-foot-4-inch forward, Ali Daei.
A metallurgical engineer from the Azerbaijan region of Iran,
Daei had a father who did not want him to play until he had
graduated from high school. But his mother was sympathetic to her
son's athletic interests.
His mother must have a wonderful eye for talent. Her son now
plays in the prestigious German Bundesliga and has just signed for
next season with Bayern Munich. He is strong in the air and
unafraid of contact. Iran committed 30 fouls in a fearless 1-0 loss
to Yugoslavia, and Daei was whistled nine times. This is why
Sampson may assign Lalas to him, muscle for muscle.
At 6-3, Lalas would also enjoy a considerable height advantage
over many Iranian players, which could come in handy on finishing
corner kicks in front of the opposing goal, where he can be
dangerous. But a different lineup and a different formation will
not matter unless the Americans also bring a new attitude to the
Iran game. Formations don't win games, determined players do.
Sentiment aside, the two countries are still far apart, and
officials are on guard against the possible disruption of politics
and violence. No banners will be allowed inside Gerland Stadium on
Sunday. A Swiss referee has been appointed, a neutral arbiter from
a neutral country.
And when the game is over, Sampson said, he will try to collect
an Iranian jersey, perhaps Daei's, for his 9-year-old son, Brandon.
As one of 14 commanders on the Pittsburgh police force, Ms.
Bryant gets more than her share of opportunities to do things right
the first time. And so do hundreds of other women in blue who
patrol the streets of the nation's 48th largest city.
On a police force of 1,100 officers, 25 percent are women, the
highest percentage of any law-enforcement agency in the United
States and more than twice the average percentage, says a recent
study by the National Center for Women and Policing, a Los Angeles
division of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
The survey, which reflects the composition of 100 agencies in
1997, also found that the Pittsburgh force included the nation's
highest percentage of women in command positions, 37.5 percent. In
addition to Ms. Bryant, whose district has the highest crime rate
in the city, five other women in Pittsburgh are commanders, a rank
just below assistant chief and deputy chief.
Pittsburgh is just one of a number of major cities where crime
rates are steadily falling, and neither Ms. Bryant nor any other
senior official on the force attributes the trend to the large
number of women who are officers. More likely, they agreed, new
community policing techniques and updated technology were helping
the department to turn from a reactive style, largely responding to
911 calls, to a preventive approach.
