Now Richard Holbrooke is back full time as the chief
representative at the United Nations, a job that brings with it
cabinet rank and a seat on the National Security Council.
Holbrooke, who negotiated the Bosnia peace agreement in 1995 and
has carried out diplomatic peacemaking missions to Cyprus and
Kosovo province in Serbia since then, was effusively praised
Thursday by President Clinton.
Holbrooke may have brought a fragile peace to Bosnia, but his
detractors point out that a goal of U.S. policy the creation of a
viable and united Bosnian state remains unfulfilled. Hundreds of
thousands of refugees and displaced persons have not returned home,
and Bosnia's Croats, Muslims and Serbs refuse to be stitched into a
unified republic.
To move the Bosnian Serbs toward an armistice, but to avoid
having to negotiate with them directly, Holbrooke persuaded Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic to act as their negotiator and
representative.
This dependence on Milosevic to deliver the Bosnian Serbs opened
Holbrooke to intense criticism that he gave away too much to the
man who inspired the Bosnian war, a man whom many believe should
have been indicted as a war criminal, a man whose forces are today
conducting a violent campaign against ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo.
In accepting the United Nations job his third stint in
government Holbrooke choked back tears as he described a lifelong
love for the United Nations that was instilled in him as an
8-year-old child visiting the United Nations with his parents.
Holbrooke, who has been a vice chairman of the investment
banking firm Credit Suisse First Boston for more than two years,
was a front-runner for the job of secretary of state in the second
Clinton term. He even interviewed for the post with Clinton, before
the president decided on Madeleine Albright.
That job was given to Bill Richardson, who was nominated to be
secretary of energy Thursday. This time around, Holbrooke was
offered and immediately accepted the job.
Holbrooke's style has been described as both exceedingly
charming and brutally tough. He survives on only a few hours of
sleep a night, can carry on two or three telephone conversations
and monitor television at the same time.
Richard Charles Albert Holbrooke was born on April 24, 1941, in
New York City, the elder of two sons of Dan Holbrooke, a doctor,
and Trudi Moos, the daughter of a leather exporter in Germany. Both
his parents, who were Jewish, fled the Nazis in the 1930s.
Holbrooke's father changed his name to Holbrooke when he arrived
in the United States. Holbrooke's mother took her son to Quaker
meetings on Sundays.
