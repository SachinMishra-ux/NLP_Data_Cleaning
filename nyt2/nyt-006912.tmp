The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
Japan's plight has not caused the region's ills. But it affects
Asia in two ways. Lack of demand in its economy much the region's
biggest means that the crippled tigers cannot export their way to
recovery.
Sales to Japan account for as much as 12 percent of Malaysia's
GDP, and 5-7 percent of GDP in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
Taiwan. In addition, the weak yen reduces the competitive advantage
that the Asian devaluations would otherwise have given the tigers'
currencies.
On the face of it, Asia needs both stronger demand in Japan and
a stronger yen. But arranging both is tricky, even supposing that
Japan can summon the will to do so.
This dilemma has helped to fuel the recent mood of despair and
yet it can be resolved. In itself, the harm that a weak yen does to
Asia is not great. The yen has fallen over the past couple of
months, but it remains much stronger against the other East Asian
currencies than a year ago.
Also, though South Korea and Taiwan compete head-on with Japan,
other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia,
export quite different goods: their competitiveness in third
markets is not directly affected by the fall in the yen.
All in all, a cheap yen would be a small price for Asia to pay
for a speedier recovery in Japan.
To this, the most resolute pessimists reply that neither a cheap
yen nor anything else will spur the Japanese economy.
Fiscal policy has stopped working; the sickness of Japan's banks
makes any macroeconomic approach to the problem, fiscal or
monetary, irrelevant; the country's productive potential, not
merely its ability to mobilize demand, is collapsing. And so the
litany of despair goes on.
