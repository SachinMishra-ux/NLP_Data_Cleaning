Ms. Jyoung was hardly the only one here to express amazement at
a political odyssey that can be compared to the ultimate triumphs
of Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Vaclav Havel of the Czech
Republic and other champions of lost causes.
Successive South Korean dictators tried to have Kim killed,
coming extremely close more than once. In 1980, the military regime
then in charge sentenced him to the gallows, but chose instead to
send him into exile in the United States. Even after he returned
home in 1985, and after South Korea then nurtured a fledgling
democracy, he seemed destined to spend the rest of his years in
permanent opposition.
But there he was Sunday, his country's leader since February,
walking triumphantly into the banquet hall with a slight limp, the
legacy of one of those assassination attempts.
A Roman Catholic, he told of how after his election he had
called on Cardinal Stephen Kim Sou Hwan, South Korea's Roman
Catholic prelate. The cardinal, he said, had observed that his
election should stand as a model to young Koreans of how
perseverance can lead to success.
Kim, 74, seemed to enjoy wading through the crowd and shaking
hands with the Korean-Americans, many of whom had left South Korea
20 or 30 years ago but still had deep emotional and economic ties
to their homeland.
He was applauded warmly and often by the guests for the most
part business people, academics and clergy who came from New York
City or from this part of Bergen County where thousands of
Korean-Americans have settled. He was also ardently praised as a
fighter for democracy by Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey.
But there was an underlying restraint. It was a sharp contrast
to the emotional outbursts that Kim, a gifted speaker, is capable
of producing.
Some who came to the Palisadium banquet hall, on the Hudson
River, said they would probably not have voted for him if they had
had the chance. They were not sure at first, they said, that he was
the right person to guide the country through its most serious
financial crisis in decades. Like millions of South Koreans, they
had long heard military-dominated governments denounce Kim as an
irresponsible populist.
But now, in his fourth month in office, he seems to have won
over even the skeptics. And if the applause was not boisterous, it
was nonetheless ample. The most frequently expressed opinion was
that Kim had thus far handled the crisis well.
Kim arrived on Saturday and stayed overnight at the
Intercontinental Hotel in New York under tight security, which was
equally intense in Cliffside Park. In the morning, he attended Mass
at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and met with Cardinal John O'Connor
afterward.
