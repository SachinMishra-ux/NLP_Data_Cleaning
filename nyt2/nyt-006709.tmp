The deal, expected to be completed in late September or early
October, would make Atlanta-based Nova the nation's fourth-largest
provider of credit card processing for merchants, after First Data,
National Processing and Paymentech. Nova is now fifth.
The combined company, with revenue of $1 billion and 1,600
employees, would manage 350,000 accounts on which about $40 billion
is charged a year. First Data, which plans to move its headquarters
to Atlanta from New Jersey, is nearly six times larger, processing
$232 billion in transactions for merchants.
Nova, which said it doesn't plan any layoffs after the merger,
authorizes credit card and debit card transactions for merchants,
captures the data and pays the merchants. It also provides
value-added services, such as information on how frequently
customers shop.
PMT Services shareholders will receive 0.715 of a share of Nova
stock for each PMT Services share they hold. All told, Nova plans
to issue a total of 36.2 million shares. Nova now has a similar
number of shares outstanding, said James M. Bahin, vice chairman
and chief financial officer.
Before Thursday's merger announcement, analysts had expected
Nova to earn 75 cents a share this year, a 29 percent increase from
last year's 58 cents a share.
First Union owns 21 percent of Nova's shares outstanding, Bahin
said. That will drop to about 10 percent when the deal with PMT
Services is completed, he said. First Union got its stake in 1996,
when the two companies combined their merchant processing units.
WorldCom, which provided the initial seed money for Nova and
continues to provide the company's telecommunications links, will
see its stake drop to about 2.5 percent from 5 percent, Bahin said.
It first appeared in 1946 when a generation hardened to reality
by the Depression and war let it pass without saluting. They knew
from bitter experience that the whole town never turns up to
slather its George Baileys in money and love.
The movie caught on only later, in the television age when the
country was far enough removed from hard times to put up with such
hokum about human nature. Now here it is: officially certified by
the American Film Institute as the 11th-best movie of all time.
Mean old Lionel Barrymore, you told it like it was.
These prominent Americans must have been too busy becoming
prominent ever to have experienced the ecstasy of chewing Jujubes
while Gary Cooper was ordering his pirate's funeral.
