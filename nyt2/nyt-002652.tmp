But Mario Cuomo, the former governor, who vetoed capital
punishment legislation in each of his 12 years in office, called
the verdict wrong.
BLUFF, Utah Police reopened this small San Juan River town to
traffic from the outside Sunday morning and said they would cut
back their search for two armed fugitives who are suspects in the
killing of a police officer.
Sheriff Mike Lacy of San Juan County said he made the decision
to scale back the search after Saturday brought no sightings of
Alan Pilon, 30, of Dove Creek, Colo., or Jason Wayne McVean, 26, of
Durango, Colo. The two men have been sought since May 29 as
suspects in the killing of one police officer and the shooting of
three others.
About 500 people have been looking for the fugitives, including
Navajo trackers and National Guardsmen who have provided infrared
and night-vision observation equipment.
Officers are using maps found among the suspects' belongings to
search for caves and other places they might have hidden food,
water and other supplies in the parched arroyos and canyons of the
Four Corners region of Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. They
searched a mine on Saturday, Lacy said.
The search began in Cortez, Colo., where three men in camouflage
clothing killed a city police officer and wounded two sheriff's
deputies in the ensuing pursuit and gun battle. Last Thursday, the
search shifted to the area near Bluff when a sheriff's deputy here
was shot and one of the suspects, Robert Matthew Mason, 26, of
Durango, was found dead from a bullet wound at a campsite near
town. Authorities believe that Mason committed suicide.
Bluff was evacuated on Thursday afternoon. Residents were
allowed to return on Saturday, but outsiders were barred until 10
a.m. Sunday. Police officers continued to stand guard at roadblocks
at the four entrances to the town and asked visitors not to pick up
anyone or give anyone a ride out of town.
Galen Headley, who owns the Cadillac Ranch R.V. Park here, said
he evacuated the park but decided to stay at home instead of
spending Thursday night with the 230 other residents who left town.
WASHINGTON The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
said Sunday that testimony to the panel last week in closed session
showed that the Chinese government had planned to influence the
1996 election.
But the chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., added that it
remained unclear whether the efforts were actually carried out. His
comments were based on testimony by Attorney General Janet Reno,
CIA Director George Tenet and FBI Director Louis Freeh.
