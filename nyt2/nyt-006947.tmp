Benjamin was not in the clubhouse after the game. Williams said
his valuable utilityman was day-to-day but sounded concerned that
the injury could have more lasting consequences. The list of downed
Red Sox second basemen is already a long one: Tim Naehring, Jeff
Frye, and Mark Lemke.
The Devil Rays had rallied to tie the score, 5-5, in the eighth
with a two-out, two-run rally started by a double by a still frisky
Wade Boggs, the Tampa native son who had three hits Thursday night
after celebrating his 40th birthday Monday with a home run.
While Lowe, who gave up home runs to Paul Sorrento and Mike
Kelly but had a 5-3 lead when he left after six innings, remained
on hold, O'Leary needed to wait just four days for the chance to
deliver another game-winner off Jim Mecir, who was with the Red Sox
last season in name only.
O'Leary, whose 10th-inning single off Mecir Sunday night in
Fenway Park made a loser of the Devil Rays, drove a ball into the
left-center-field gap off Mecir after walks to Mo Vaughn and
DH-in-limbo Jim Leyritz, who had three hits and a walk in a rare
start against a righthander. That provided the Sox with their third
straight win and seventh in eight games.
Springer the pitcher, not the talk show terrorist is a
knuckleballer who had success fooling O'Leary (ground out, double
play, whiff) but was less of a mystery to the rest of the Red Sox
lineup, which knocked him around for five runs and nine hits before
he left after Darren Bragg's single to start the seventh.
Much of the damage was done by Leyritz and Vaughn, who doubled
and scored in the second, singled home two runs in the fifth, and
drew a one-out walk off Esteban Yan that accounted for the winning
run.
While he is openly campaigning for a trade, Leyritz made it
clear again he just wants to play, period. That and have a contract
in hand for next season.
TOKYO Japan's leading politicians are furiously thrashing out
the details of what the government hopes will emerge as a landmark
blueprint to clean up the nation's bad debts.
And the blueprint is likely to be an important topic on Friday
during talks when the deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, Lawrence
Summers, meets with Japanese government officials and party leaders
on Friday.
After playing down the bad-loan problem for years, the
government now acknowledges that clearing away the loans may be the
single most important factor in building confidence overseas and in
giving a lift to the economy.
