Memory may have softened reality and added a glow, but the
television audience can still learn much from the likes of Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., Rep. John Lewis and Richard Goodwin about the
hopes he aroused and the causes in which he enlisted.
Newsreels carry the story from the young man's brief association
with Sen. Joseph McCarthy through his zealous attacks on mobsters
and corrupt labor leaders like James Hoffa; from his tough-minded
services to his brother John as campaigner, attorney general and
intimate adviser through his emergence as a moral force as senator
from New York and in his campaign for the 1968 Democratic
presidential nomination.
Kennedy's accomplishments never matched the promise that his
admirers detected in him, but that only adds to the sorrow for the
young knight felled prematurely and for what might have been.
Such is the legacy being advanced by this memoir. How realistic
that assessment is must be left to more objective scholars, but at
the least they will have to take such prospects or dreams into
their own cooler accounts.

When I moved to a quarter-acre property in central New Jersey 20
years ago, I wasn't interested in shrubs. I thought that they were
all overwhelming in size and that their lack of color, fragrance
and seasonal change made them unsuitable for my small beds.
It took me a while, however, to realize how wrong I had been. In
the beginning, as many other gardeners have done, I concentrated on
perennials and bulbs so that I could have a flowing tapestry of
color from spring through fall in my long, narrow borders.
After 10 years, though, I knew something was still missing. In
winter, the beds were bare and boring. In spring, emerging
perennials provided little variation in height. By summer, my
packed flowers needed a solid, stable block of form to tie together
their many elements. And in fall, it would have been nice to have a
stalwart architectural presence instead of a waning heap of plants.
Just at this time 1988 the Pennsylvania Horticultural
Society introduced its Gold Medal Award, singling out commercially
available woody ornamentals that are beautiful, low-maintenance,
hardy and underutilized. Each year, the winners are described in
the society's magazine, Green Scene.
I went to my local garden center, chose a sweetspire, and tucked
it into a shady corner at the back of my house. Its open, arching
branches look lovely as they shelter spring-blooming bulbs and
ground covers below and add form and structure in a small garden
area the rest of the year.
