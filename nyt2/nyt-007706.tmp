The pot of gold for Fidelity and the others is the more than $9
trillion in personal assets owned by Japanese individuals, the
largest reservoir of wealth in the world.
In the midst of a nine-year bear market, Japanese have placed
nearly 60 percent of that massive nest egg is in low-yielding
savings and post office accounts, and invested less than 10 percent
in stocks or mutual funds, known locally as investment trusts. Now,
as banks and a major brokerage have gone bankrupt, Japanese are so
concerned about protecting their money that they are buying home
safes at a record pace.
The mutual fund companies hope to attract risk-averse Japanese
investors by exploiting fears of a collapsing retirement system.
They are betting that by 1999 Japanese will gain direct control of
their retirement funds through the adoption a tax-sheltered scheme
similar to the 401(k) plan that has spurred the meteoric rise of
personal investment in America by making it easy to buy mutual
funds.
Japanese employees have traditionally accepted long working
hours because they believed the company would take care of them for
life. Now a sluggish economy and miserable stock market are leading
to questions about the sustainability of such an arrangement.
While the potential rewards for addressing such concerns are
vast, the foreign mutual fund companies will have to flex all of
their marketing muscles to convince Japanese consumers to make
mutual funds a way of life.
The Japanese reluctance to gamble money on stocks is intensified
by a market that has lost an average of 6 percent annually since
1989. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks has plunged from a peak of
almost 39,000 to less than 15,600.
Japan has also yet to be exposed to the kind of hype that has
added to the American vocabulary terms such as asset allocation,
long-term investing and risk assesment. Funds in Japan were
previously available only through brokerages, which tried to boost
commissions by encouraging frequent buying and selling.
Still, the foreign securities companies seem relatively credible
in a country that has been shaken by financial scandals and the
collapse of financial institutions. Fidelity is promoting its funds
in a series of full-page newspaper ads that portray the company as
a fresh place to start in a new investment era.
Fidelity says the response has exceeded expectations. The
company on April 1 began its direct marketing efforts with a
toll-free phone number that more than 3,000 people used in the
first week alone.
Fidelity has purchased land in Tochigi Prefecture, a three hour
train ride from Tokyo, for future expansion. Merrill paid up to
$300 million for 33 retail brokerage outlets formally owned by the
defunct Yamaichi Securities, and hired some 2,000 of the firm's
employees.
