Because the treatment, known as brachytherapy, has fewer side
effects than surgery, its use is expected to grow significantly in
the coming decade. In addition to North American, just two other
companies currently make the seeds.
North American shares have been led down by profit-takers who
have seen the company's stock rise nearly 700 percent in a year,
according to analyst John Calcagnini at CIBC Oppenheimer in Los
Angeles.

DETROIT The best time to buy a new car is August or September,
right? Perhaps not this year: The end-of-the-model-year clearance
may have already begun.
Sellers usually offer their best deals in late summer and early
fall, as dealers try to clear their lots and showrooms to make room
for the next year's models. This year, however, supplies are
already low, thanks to a hearty economy, near-record vehicle sales,
generous sales incentives and a spreading autoworker strike against
General Motors Corp. With fewer cars to sell, manufacturers are
likely to cut back on their inducements to buyers.
U.S. vehicle sales reached 1.5 million cars and trucks in May,
making it the strongest month since September 1986. The seasonally
adjusted annual selling rate reached 16.3 million, the best level
since October 1987, and the trend appears to be continuing this
month.
James Holden, Chrysler Corp.'s executive vice president for
sales and marketing, said Chrysler's sales have been strong this
month. In May, Chrysler sold 250,000 cars and trucks, a one-month
record.
The strong car and truck sales are set against the backdrop of a
robust economy, and low interest rates have brought a wave of
mortgage refinancings, putting more money in Americans' pockets.
But vehicle manufacturers have also offered sweeteners, spending as
much as $1,700 a vehicle on sales incentives like cash rebates,
low-interest loans and discount coupons in May and June, up from
about $1,100 a year earlier.
