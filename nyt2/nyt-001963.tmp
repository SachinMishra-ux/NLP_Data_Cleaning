Without a doubt, Yeltsin is still able to make a number of the
unpredictable moves characteristic of him. After all, this
president enjoys rights under a Constitution tailored to suit him
and he may once again choose to shake the world by some extravagant
escapade. But he won't accomplish anything of substance.
As governor, Lebed will have a seat on the Federation Council,
the upper house of Russia's Parliament. He holds a popular moral
authority indeed an immunity which Yeltsin himself used to enjoy
from any real or imagined accusations of wrongdoing.
Indeed, unless Lebed fails to learn anything from the mistakes
made by his former and present rivals, he is likely to enter the
Kremlin no matter what barricades are thrown up in his path.
The mistakes are rather obvious; the general must have memorized
them by now. Lebed will not try to play the role of a rowdy
politician like the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky. He will not
confuse people with statements about restoring Sevastopol and
Crimea to Russia like Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov does. He will not
get himself televised after midnight in saunas or houses of ill
repute. He will not hasten to write books and keep the profits. He
will not order from France pedigree cows or indulge himself in
finding new wives and lovers.
With all that has befallen Russia the collapsed economy, the
social decline, the unpaid salaries, the disappearance of public
services Yeltsin will not be helped out in the next elections by
the tricks that have worked in prior races: not the Moscow bankers'
money, nor the intellectual horror of the Moscow elite, nor the
Federation Council's gubernatorial jealousy.
The most helpless one in this tussle will be President Yeltsin.
Even now, those surrounding Yeltsin, in their minds, have already
fled. As for the power structures and the military that Yeltsin has
in fact been leaning on since 1993, while trying to appear loyal to
him, they will try to coordinate their every move with every move
Lebed makes. The generals may wear the stars that Yeltsin pinned on
them, but they will serve him looking over their shoulder at the
other man.
But there is also danger. The measure of confidence the newly
elected Krasnoyarsk governor is going to get if he wins the Russian
presidential elections will make people accept not just his
presidency, but also his dictatorship. Lebed will be saying that
his rule is a special brand of leadership a monarchy of the law,
conscience and order. Who will argue against it in Russia's current
poverty-stricken state?
As for fascism, no one has proven yet that Russia is afraid of
fascism. Yeltsin has already laid a foundation of tolerance toward
limited fascism and, in many cases, the State Duma has openly
sabotaged the passing of antifascist legislation.
As for the vaccination against fascism the people are said to
have received, this is a dangerous myth. Those who lived under
communism are not to be intimidated by fascism.
MOSCOW President Boris Yeltsin finds himself in a country
which does not actually belong to or obey him any more.
