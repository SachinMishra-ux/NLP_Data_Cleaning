Christians who embrace their gayness also cite Scripture. And
their contention that homosexuality isn't something that can be
changed has in recent years been reinforced by many in the
scientific and psychological communities.
Gays and ex-gays differ on basic assumptions about
homosexuality. Most Christians who believe God can change a
person's sexual orientation think that homosexuality is not inborn,
but caused by a person's environment. They often cite an inadequate
relationship between children and parents as the spark for
homosexuality.
Many gay Christians who laim they have been healed are
unwilling to say they no longer are attracted to members of the
same sex. They describe healing as a process, not an overnight
change. Temptation remains.
Richard Morton is a member of Living Stones, an Atlanta-based
ministry affiliated with Exodus International. Morton, 40, a
minister's son from Indiana, joined Living Stones after his
marriage failed because of his homosexuality. He lost his wife and
male lover in the same year.
Morton said Living Stones uses a tough-love approach. Members
are required to meet each week, stay in constant touch with a
sponsor, and are forbidden to buy pornography.
Critics of the ex-gay movement believe Morton's quest will
ultimately fail. They scoff at the idea that homosexuality can be
explained by a deficient relationship between a child and a parent.
Vaiden, for example, said he got along great with his father and
mother. Both supported him when he left his wife, although they
didn't understand his decision.
Yet many Christians who believe that God can deliver people from
homosexuality think the argument that people are born gay is
irrelevant.
Dallas points out that studies suggesting biological roots for
homosexuality are small in sample size and far from proven, a point
Haldeman concedes.
Of much greater importance, Dallas adds, is the fact that
Christians who grapple with homosexual desires must still obey
Scripture, which forbids homosexuality.
