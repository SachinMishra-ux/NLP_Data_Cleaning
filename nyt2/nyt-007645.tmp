The leaders including Gingrich backed off the plan. They
agreed instead to put the $4 billion into a separate bill and to
make $4 billion in cuts elsewhere, although they did not say where.
The process is fraught with such problems. One of the most
difficult is that in such a tight budget, spending for one lawmaker
invariably means cuts for another.
For example, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, urged a subcommittee last
week not to agree to a $50 million proposal by Vice President Al
Gore to send pictures of Earth by satellite to computers 24 hours a
day. DeLay said private companies could pay for the pictures if
anyone wanted them.
This prompted Obey to suggest that if Gore's project was not
being financed because he was a Democrat, Democrats might highlight
projects sought by Gingrich, such as a $5.5 million designation for
programs at the American Museum of Natural History (Gingrich is
fond of animals), and $15 million to buy land in the Chattahoochee
River watershed in Georgia, Gingrich's home state.
At the same time, in another subcommittee, Rep. Sidney Yates,
D-Ill., suggested eliminating the Chattahoochee project so that
Illinois could build a visitors' center in a national park honoring
the starting point of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, defended the Chattahoochee land
acquisition, saying it would prevent development of a major
recreation area. And he opposed the visitors' center for Illinois,
saying he had requests from 18 members to finance centers in parks
throughout the country and that he could not pick one over the
other.
GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas Jerry Jeff Walker has wailed beer-soaked
ballads in the paddock garden. Thousands of children have been
encouraged to wander through the petting zoo and family playground.
And Friday night, Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie played host to 12
of the nation's top riders in an unusual competition called the
all-star jockey championship.
Situated halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth, Lone Star is in
the second year of a remarkably successful launch into the troubled
world of thoroughbred racing. The track's secret has been to offer
customers more than the simple prospect of betting on horses and
instead try to be as many things to as many people as possible.
In that spirit came the jockey showdown, and before a capacity
crowd of 16,156 and a national television audience on ESPN2, Shane
Sellers collected $25,000 and the championship for gaining the most
points over four races against 11 of his celebrated peers.
There have been some encouraging signs recently in thoroughbred
racing, which is coming off a thrilling Triple Crown campaign and
finally has a well-financed central-marketing office to help guide
the sport into an increasingly crowded marketplace. And when the
newly formed National Thoroughbred Racing Association was looking
for a vehicle to help create year-round awareness for its sport, it
gravitated to this hustling Texas track and the second annual
jockey championship.
