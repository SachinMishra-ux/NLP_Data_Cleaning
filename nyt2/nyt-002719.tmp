Of course, it's possible that you misunderstood the policy. Is
the company really withholding your pay? Or did it just change the
schedule for issuing paychecks?
 Q: I am a self-employed editor. One of my clients is a
publisher back east who considers me an employee and withholds
taxes from my paychecks. Because this client considers me an
employee, my tax accountant says I cannot deduct my expenses for
jobs done for this client. But the client doesn't provide me with
me any supplies or materials. Do I have any choice about their
treating me as an employee?
 A: There are a growing number of cases these days where
companies misclassify employees as independent contractors, in an
effort to avoid paying benefits or to pare down their full-time
workforce.
You've got the opposite situation you're an independent
contractor who is being misclassified as an employee.
Before asking to be reclassified, do some math and make sure it
would pay off to be reclassified. As an employee, you and your
employer each pay 7.65 percent of your wages into Social Security
and Medicare; as a contractor, you'd have to pay the full 15.3
percent yourself.
Also, there may be a way for you to deduct your expenses even
as an employee. Oakland accountant David Roberts suggests you take
a look at IRS Form 2106. That would allow you to tally up and
deduct unreimbursed business expenses but only if you file a tax
return with itemized deductions, and only if your unreimbursed
expenses total more than 2 percent of your income.

BOSTON All he's ever wanted to do in Boston, really, is
contribute in any way possible. As a starter. A reliever out of
the bullpen. And, on those rare occasions, even as a pinch runner.
But Sunday night before 30,630 at Fenway Park, Avery took
another step in cementing his spot in Boston's starting rotation which always had been his intended role by throwing seven innings
of shutout ball, allowing just three hits and one walk while
ringing up four strikeouts, to lead the Red Sox to a 5-0 victory
over the New York Mets.
Avery's last start was last Tuesday in Toronto. He went five
innings and allowed three runs and three hits in a 5-3 victory,
only his second of the season and first since a 5-0 shutout over
Kansas City May 16. The reason he was nervous was that he was
experimenting with some new mechanics on the mound, a new release
point suggested by pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.
