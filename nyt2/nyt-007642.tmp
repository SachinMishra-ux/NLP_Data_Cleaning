In the broadest sense this is just another chapter in the debate
about the wisdom of an engagement policy with China that dates from
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Even Clinton, after criticizing
engagement in the 1992 presidential campaign, embraced it as the
best way to influence Chinese behavior in the next century.
One skeptic is Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, who
complains that under Clinton, engagement is uncritical. Any action
to constrain Chinese behavior can be rationalized as harmful to the
larger goal of drawing China into international relationships that
may moderate the government in Beijing, he said.
The debates swirl over detailed findings about what might be in
certain crates shipped by China to Pakistan in the early '90s and
whether they contained missiles or missile parts, as is widely
believed but not proven. And if the crates did contain missiles,
were they Chinese M-11 missiles or another kind, and with what
range?
Similarly, what specific help has China provided Pakistan to
build one certain factory in Rawalpindi, and is that factory
designed to produce missiles and, if so, what kind and what range,
and will they be considered Chinese or Pakistani?
Those questions matter, because the different laws are specific
about what requires different sanctions. The only missiles subject
to sanctions fall under the Missile Technology Control Regime,
which covers those capable of carrying warheads of 500 kilograms,
or 1,100 pounds, at least 300 kilometers, 190 miles.
National security is never separate from domestic politics, a
senior congressional staff member said, which is why presidents
from every party prefer not to receive perfect answers.
TEHRAN, Iran In a high-stakes political battle filled with
recriminations and rage, Iran's Parliament voted Sunday to dismiss
one of the closest allies of Mohammad Khatami, the reform-minded
president.
Parliament is controlled by Khatami's enemies. Its action Sunday
is the most serious political setback to his presidency since his
landslide victory 13 months ago as well as graphic proof of
Khatami's limited room for maneuver in Iran's Islamic Republic.
The vote comes just just three days after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright warmly praised Khatami and the reforms made
since he took office and held out the prospect of eventual
normalization of relations with Iran.
The vote, 137-117 with 11 abstentions, came in a secret ballot
after several hours of impassioned debate in which Noori was
accused of arrogantly dismissing officials who did not share his
politics, fostering an unstable economic environment and putting
the country's security at risk.
