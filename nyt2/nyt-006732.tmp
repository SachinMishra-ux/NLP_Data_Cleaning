After debating the bill for a month, the Senate set it aside
Wednesday night. An effort by supporters to win the 60 votes
necessary to cut off debate and bring the measure to a final vote
fell 3 votes short. All but two Democrats voted to stop the debate,
but they were joined by only 14 of the 54 Republicans who voted.
Democrats swore that they would bring up the measure again and
again this year, but a vote Thursday illustrated how dim the
prospects are that they will succeed in getting the bill passed.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle offered the original Senate
bill as an amendment to a bill providing money for energy and water
projects. The Daschle effort was blocked, 54-44, on a party-line
vote.
At a joint news conference, Daschle and House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt struggled for new ways to attack the Republican
opponents of the legislation.
His bill, Gingrich said, would give the Food and Drug
Administration new authority to regulate the marketing of
cigarettes and would have provisions to restrict teen-agers' access
to cigarettes.
Rep. Deborah Pryce of Ohio, who heads the Republicans' group
developing the bill, said that the measure would also offer
inducements to states to withdraw the driver's licenses of
teen-agers caught buying or possessing cigarettes.
BOSTON Nearly three out of every 10 households with children
in Massachusetts have no father in the home, according to a report
released Thursday by the Massachusetts Family Institute.
In its second annual report on Massachusetts families, the
institute estimated that 29 percent of families had no fathers
living with them in 1997, up 2 percent since 1995 and almost
quadruple the percentage in 1960. The estimates were generated for
the institute by the Massachusetts Institute for Social and
Economic Research in Amherst using US Census data. 
Jetta Bernier, executive director of the Massachusetts Committee
for Children and Youth, said the issue of fatherlessness resonates
with many child and family advocacy groups, liberal and
conservative.
But, she said, lack of education and job training, and the
failure of wages to keep pace with inflation, have made it
difficult for low-income men to form stable, strong relationships
with their children and their mothers.
