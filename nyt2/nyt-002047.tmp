The solution is then checked for vitellogenin-mRNA, the first in
a series of compounds produced after an estrogen receptor in a
liver cell has been activated. To make this possible, the
researchers first use the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which
can make millions of copies of a single piece of DNA or RNA.
But Kloas warns that it is often difficult to tell to what
extent chemicals that mimic estrogen will disrupt sexual
development.
So his test involves a further stage in which xenopus tadpoles
are immersed in the chemical to see how it affects their sexual
development. If an unusually high proportion of the tadpoles
develop female characteristics, this indicates a strong estrogenic
effect.
Some researchers have suggested that estrogen-type chemicals
have reduced the proportion of male amphibians in the wild, and
that this is one reason why amphibian populations around the world
have declined. 
This is a car of surprises. At first glance, it reminds this
columnist of something British from the 1960s. It's from the other
end of the world.
It's slick, sleek, outfitted to the nines, and it exhibits very
fine road manners; it is a much better car than I would have
expected from a company called Daewoo. I had never seen a luxury
car from Daewoo nor do I remember a true luxury automobile from
any Korean manufacturer. At least, I had never driven one. Frankly,
I had expected a lot less than this Daewoo Laganza delivered.
The minimal expectations do not spring from any antipathy to
things Korean but from earlier experience with a Daewoo automobile a tinny little bucket dubbed Pontiac LeMans. Daewoo early on had
a partnership of sorts with General Motors, and it was a Daewoo of
small virtue that inherited the muscle car moniker during one of
GM's many product reshufflings. It was at best a very bad joke.
Daewoo has moved away from GM and looked toward a Porsche
executive, Ulrich Bez, for design expertise; Laganza, therefore, is
no joke but a fairly accurate Korean quotation of a European car.
There were a couple of other surprises, too. Although the price
of Laganza has not been set as of this writing, it may be a bargain
in today's market. The Americans in Daewoo want to price it around
$17,000; the Koreans see $20K as more reasonable an asking price.
Somewhere in the middle, would still be low for a nicely styled
five-passenger sedan with air conditioning, power everything, and
other amenities. The tested Laganza came with leather and a CD
player; perhaps those are meant to be options, perhaps not.
That brings us to the other surprise or disappointment: The
columnist is roadtesting a vehicle that isn't yet available. In
fact, the first New England dealership isn't open yet. The car is
expected to go on sale around Sept. 1.
