Scott Brosius gave the Yankees the lead with a two-run homer in
the third, then added a solo shot in the fifth. The Yankees scored
another in the sixth to lead 4-0 before Atlanta made it 4-3 in the
bottom of the sixth on a two-run double by Chipper Jones and
Galarraga's RBI single. New York scored two in the eighth to lead
6-3 before the Braves rallied in the ninth.
It started off as a pitchers' duel between Kevin Millwood and
David Wells, but with the scored tied at 1 in the sixth, the Braves
scored seven runs. Michael Tucker began the rally with a solo
homer. But the Yankees scored four off Millwood in the seventh, and
the Braves bullpen blew up again, with Ligtenberg and Alan Embree
combining to give up four runs. It was the second blown save of the
series for Atlanta.
If baseball ever needed an odd couple among its ownership, it
got it in Turner and Steinbrenner, two of the richest and most
powerful men in sports. Ted and George. George and Ted. Instead of
well-worn adjectives to describe the two, just recall that Turner
has gone to great financial lengths to save the world, and
Steinbrenner has gone to great lengths to control it.
George's main concern at the moment is whether he can force the
city of New York to tear down Yankee Stadium and build him a new
ballpark. Ted's main concern is about nuclear testing in India and
Pakistan.
That makes the upcoming series between the owners' baseball
teams more than a brief recreational respite from a mundane summer
schedule that has both teams threatening to lead their respective
divisions by double figures. In June.
But Turner and Atlanta have persevered. And Steinbrenner and New
York have persevered. In fact, that's why George and Ted are fond
of each other.
When the series begins in New York on Monday, the smartly
dressed Steinbrenner will be sitting in his club-level box, rocking
away in his leather recliner. And when the series shifts back to
Atlanta on Wednesday, Turner, in his best free-spirit attire, will
be watching from his seat near the field, jabbering away.
Turner will have his hands on a soft drink; Steinbrenner will
have his hands on the controls.
Turner, 60, paid $10 million for the Braves in 1976 and became
the proud owner of one of the worst franchises in sports.
Steinbrenner, 67, bought the Yankees in 1973 for $8.8 million and
had one of the best.
With good reason. Both men pushed baseball's envelope. Turner
once rolled a ball around the bases with his nose and rode an
ostrich in an on-field race. He was suspended by commissioner Bowie
Kuhn for taking over as manager for one Braves game.
