Steinbrenner said he and Turner did not make a bet during the
1996 World Series, and he doesn't expect to do it this week.
Notes: Neagle broke a personal three-game losing streak in his
last outing Tuesday. Against a weak Florida lineup, he threw a
four-hit shutout and beat the Marlins 7-0. He struck out nine and
walked none. On June 5 of last season, Neagle shut out the Expos
9-0 in the Big O on a six-hitter. But he lost his next two starts
against the Expos, lasting six innings here in a 6-2 loss last July
6 before being pounded for four homers in 5 2/3 innings in a 7-1
loss Sept. 21 in Atlanta. Rondell White homered twice that day and
has three career homers against Neagle, batting .360 (9-for-25).
Shane Andrews (6-for-14, .429, one homer) also hits Neagle well.
Neagle had allowed 14 homers this year just four less than he
gave up all last season. Although he has a losing record, Hermanson
has statistically been Montreal's most effective starter.
Even the Yankees. New York has the best record in baseball, yet
has a bullpen ERA of 4.59, eighth among AL clubs and 20th in the
majors. The Braves, with the second-best mark in the majors, have
an ERA of 4.41. Houston, leading the NL Central, has struggled at
times, as have the Angels, now on top in the AL West. The average
bullpen ERA is 4.54 in the AL, 3.86 in the NL.
As a result, after the All-Star break, the top teams are likely
to scramble for relievers on clubs that are out of contention.
Don't laugh, but a pitcher like Arizona veteran Gregg Olson, who
has played on seven teams in the last five seasons trying to
rediscover his glory days with the Orioles, will be of high value.
Olson has 10 saves, two more than Atlanta's Mark Wohlers, and a
better ERA, 3.82, to 5.63 for Wohlers. The top name out there might
well be Toronto's Randy Myers. The Blue Jays are having another
disappointing season and could be willing to deal Myers, even
though the price probably would be high. But Myers has been the
majors' most consistent closer the last six years, averaging 38
saves a season. And while his ERA of 3.90 is high for a top
reliever, he has 18 saves this year.
Ugueth Urbina of Montreal is another possibility. Urbina is
costing the Expos only $550,000, but Montreal might be tempted if
it gets some starting pitching prospects, which the organization
lacks. Urbina has 17 saves and a 1.56 ERA on a team that is 29-42
and has an ERA of 4.46.
But the player who might be the easiest to obtain is
Philadelphia's Mark Leiter, who has done a good job filling in for
disabled Ricky Bottalico. Leiter has 13 saves, but Bottalico is
close to returning. The Phillies, who have built a nice young
nucleus, can afford to deal Leiter.
NEW ORLEANS Of the options Marion Jones had on the table when
she left the North Carolina campus with her communications degree
last spring, the one that seemed the riskiest was a track and field
career. She'd made a splash as a 16-year-old at the 1992 Olympic
Trials, finishing fourth in the 200 meters. But she'd broken a foot
twice trying to ready herself for the 1996 Atlanta Games never
making it to the trials.
And besides, a pro basketball career looked like money in the
bank. The two new leagues were hustling for talent. Here Jones was
an All-American at Carolina, whose point guard skills had led the
Tar Heels to a national title only a couple of years earlier.
Yet to the surprise of many, she ventured down the road of less
guarantees and now has put herself in position to be crowned the
queen of U.S. track and field. Jones only aided her calling
Saturday night, putting her winning stamp on both the 100 meters
and long jump at the USA Track and Field Championships.
