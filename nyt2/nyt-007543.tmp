Even the U-haul was used as a sleeping place for myself and the
children for a couple of days.
I went from friend to friend, each for a different night or
couple of days. Even my mother-in-law re sponded to the need for my
children and I to have food and rest. I spent those days feeling
weak and slept most of the time.
I'd exhausted all other options. All I could think of was
waiting for the housing subsidy I'd applied for to come through,
and prayed it wouldn't be long.
Only four days back with him, I was hit in the face while trying
to leave. There was no phone in the house; he watched my every
move, monitored my pager and forbade me to associate with neighbors
unless he was there.
Our 2-year-old's condition was by then manageable and she was
recov ering. I was now pregnant again. Thoughts of having a place
of my own kept me as sane as I could manage given the abuser's
daily barrage of insults, demands and abuse.
I spent nights sleeping with the children in the back of my
vehicle, at times for nights in a row parked in a grocery store
lot.
The vehicle kept breaking down; my 8-year-old was unable to get
to school, sometimes for a whole week. I could see the hardship
weighing heavily on my children. Their beautiful little eyes so
deserv ing to be full of life held only sad confusion.
Hours of endless phone calls made from the corner pay phone, the
sound of cars and trucks drowning out whatever helpful mes sage I
might be lucky enough to connect with. I had to be on guard that
the children didn't run into the street while my attention was on a
pen and paper.
I spent those days on bus benches, building my life around the
goal of getting my daughter to school for her free lunch.
Some days I stretched the bus fare by walking a few miles,
saving enough to buy a jar of apple sauce, a little something for
the unborn child.
