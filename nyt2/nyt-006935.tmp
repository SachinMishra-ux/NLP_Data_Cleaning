It also helped ease the pain of the double bogey on No. 10, when
Lehman hit his 7-iron second shot just left of the green, made a
great chip to four feet and then three-putted.
Lehman said coming into the tournament that he thought he should
have a good week. He finished third at last week's Buick Classic,
closing with a spectacular 65. So after his early troubles
Thursday, Lehman was more than pleased with the way his day ended
up.
Beneath a swaying Ponderosa pine, Adam Blunt stirs a large
kettle of beef stew with the same stick that just stoked his fire
and explains why he threw away a six-figure career to feed hippies.
Blunt will be serving food and coffee 24 hours a day for the
next two weeks as more than 20,000 members of the Rainbow Family
stream into his campsite in the forest west of Springerville.
His hair matted and his skin darkened by sun and dirt, Blunt
said money can't buy the feeling he has at that moment watching his
pot reach a boil.
Because Rainbow gatherings typically take place on public land
and attract tens of thousands of people, the Forest Service has
created a seven-member task force that follows the Rainbows,
briefing communities on what to expect from the influx, and trying,
usually in vain, to get the family to sign a use permit.
The task force is in Springerville because on Sunday, the
Rainbows officially chose the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest for
their annual Fourth of July Gathering For World Peace.
Task force members found out about the site the same way many
Rainbows did, by checking the group's Internet site. Locals got a
clue when busloads of people started showing up in town. If the
gathering's projected size is accurate, Rainbows could soon
outnumber area residents by a 4-1 ratio.
Davis said the size of the gatherings are detrimental to the
forest, and the Rainbows' refusal to sign use permits is not fair
to others who comply. So far, the rancher who owns the water rights
to Carnero Lake and a few surrounding springs has refused to grant
the Rainbows permission to drink and bathe. The Forest Service is
negotiating for a peaceful solution, so far unsuccessfully.
The ecologically conscious Rainbows hotly dispute claims that
they damage the forest. They say the forests belong to everyone,
and they plan to leave behind about 60 members to break down camps
and reseed the trampled meadows.
