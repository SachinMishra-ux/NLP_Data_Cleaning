Nasdaq sent two letters to its issuing companies about the
coming fee increases. And as is always the case with such a
proposed fee increase, the SEC asked for public comment on it. But
companies were asked only in the Federal Register for comment, and
many remained in the dark. When companies got their bills from
Nasdaq in February, some were surprised by the higher fees.
Hardest hit were small companies, with 1 million to 10 million
shares outstanding. They saw their charges jump 33 percent to 104
percent. Which means that if the American Stock Exchange-Nasdaq
merger goes through, one unintended consequence may be a surge of
companies moving their listings to the American Stock Exchange.
That is, if the exchange keeps its fees low.
WASHINGTON A study of American cities by the Clinton
administration says the strong national economy has left most of
them in their best financial shape in decades.
The largest part of the request comes from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, which is seeking $1.8 billion in new
spending beyond the appropriation of $24 billion it has received in
each of the last five years.
While Congress is projecting a budget surplus of as much as $100
billion for 1999, it will not be easy for the administration to get
additional money for new programs. Among other reasons, Republicans
in both houses are eager to use some of the surplus to cut taxes.
The report, which is to be presented by Cuomo this weekend at
the U.S. Conference of Mayors annual convention in Reno, Nev.,
provides ample evidence that the country's economic growth in
recent years has dramatically improved conditions in cities of all
size around the country.
Among the major findings are a 10.4 percent increase in
employment in cities over the last five years, and a 34 percent
increase in new low-skilled jobs from 1994 to 1995, compared with a
13 percent increase from 1991 to 1994.
But those gains pale beside job growth in suburban areas, the
report says, a disparity that triggers a domino effect of adverse
consequences for cities. As urban problems like crime and poor
schools steadily persuade many middle-class residents to leave for
the suburbs, commercial investment follows, draining cities of
their job base and tax base.
The report contends that the people who are hurt most are the
lowest-wage earners, who have fewer job opportunities and, often,
no practical means of transportation to reach jobs in the suburbs.
The report contends that over the next five years, their ranks will
increase by 353,000 as current welfare recipients join the search
for work.
Citing a recent study of 74 urban areas by the conference of
mayors, the administration's report says that employers are likely
to find at least two applicants for the same low-paying job over
the next five years, and some cities, like Cleveland; Newark, N.J.,
and Providence, R.I., are projecting 10 or more more.
