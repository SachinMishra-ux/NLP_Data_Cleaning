Those close to Bibby have no doubts that he will succeed in the
NBA. Members of the Arizona coaching staff said they never have had
anyone work harder. From the day he set foot on campus, Bibby spent
nearly every day working on his game. Even after three-hour
practices, he and roommate Josh Pastner worked through various
shooting drills.
After this season ended, Bibby and Pastner still awoke at 5 a.m.
just so they could be the first ones in the gym.
Royce Youree, a veteran high school and college coach, coached
Bibby in a summer league a few years ago and agrees with
Rosborough.
That's where Bibby is most uncomfortable. At Arizona, he often
slipped out after a game to avoid reporters. And he has been known
to conduct interviews while never looking up from a magazine to
make eye contact with reporters.
Still, he said he doesn't mind the attention, he said, unless it
gets personal. Since high school, he has been asked constantly
about his father, with whom he has no relationship. For the past
few years, he has refused to answer questions about his dad.
Mike Bibby has been criticized by some for fathering a child out
of wedlock, which he thinks is unfair. On the court, he can
retaliate for perceived slights by making plays. Off the court, he
has little power to fight the criticism, and that's something
that's difficult for a 20-year-old to accept.
He and his girlfriend, whom he declines to name, are together,
and Bibby spends considerable time with his son, Michael Dane, who
was born in December.
He knows people behind his back joke that Bibby will fit in
perfectly in the NBA, where many players have fathered children out
of wedlock. He has been lumped in with other athletes, such as
Latrell Sprewell, as an example of today's spoiled athletes.
Bibby and his mother are extremely close, but she doesn't pamper
him constantly. Recently, a reporter had an interview scheduled
with Bibby, who seemed more interested in working out. But his
mother told him emphatically that he was going to do it. And he
did.
She also doesn't think her son deserves applause for accepting
the responsibility of fatherhood and spending time with his son.
