A columnist at the Boston Globe, a Pulitzer Prize finalist,
fabricated people and quotations in four of her columns this year
and the newspaper has asked for her resignation, the Globe
announced Thursday.
In one case, she made up nearly an entire column about a woman
dying of cancer, the newspaper said.
Ms. Smith did not return messages left on her voice mail at work
and her home telephone was out of service. Her attorney, Ike
Williams of the Boston firm Palmer Dodge, also did not return
voice mail messages.
This was the second time in Ms. Smith's career that her
credibility has come under fire. As an editorial assistant at the
Chicago Sun Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a
concert that she had not attended. The newspaper ran a correction
but she was not dismissed.
The revelations about Ms. Smith come just a week after the New
Republic published the results of an investigation into the work of
Stephen Glass, one of its staff writers, whom it said had
fabricated parts or all of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote in two
and a half years.
The Globe, which is owned by the New York Times Co., said
Friday's paper would also include a news article about the
incident.
The Globe said it discovered Ms. Smith's fabrications two weeks
ago in the normal course of monitoring by senior editors. Under the
monitoring system, which Storin said he established two and a half
years ago, editors occasionally double check columnists' sources.
Richard Gulla, a spokesman for the Globe, said he did not know
whether other people in that article, such as Ms. Gibson's daughter
Carolyn were fabricated.
Ms. Smith also acknowledged making up Jim Burke, a worker
erecting barricades at the marathon, in her column of April 20th;
and Claire, for whom Ms. Smith did not give a last name, the
subject of an entire poignant column about a woman with cancer,
published on May 11.
Ms. Smith, who began her newspaper career as a typist at the
Chicago Daily News, joined the Globe in 1990. She has been writing
a column for the Metro/Region section since 1994. Earlier this
year, she won an award from the American Society of Newspaper
Editors for a series of her columns published in 1997. She was also
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year. A poet,
she has been widely recognized in the Boston arts community for her
public readings.
