Storin said Smith acknowledged the other fabricated characters,
including a worker named Jim Burke, who was erecting barricades for
the Boston Marathon; a woman named Dorothy Gibson, whose young
daughter was getting a painful hair makeover for Easter Sunday; and
a South End cosmetologist named Janine Byrne, who was commenting on
the case involving kidnaping defendant Stephen Fagan.
When researchers could not document a number of these people,
Moore met with Smith earlier this week, at which time he said that
some questions had been raised about her columns. Editors had
failed in efforts to locate individuals quoted by name in her
column, and now the paper needed reassurance that these people did,
in fact, exist.
He handed her the names of six people, asking her to locate
them and document their existence. Over the course of a two-hour
discussion, Smith acknowledged that only two of the six names
listed were of real people.
Smith's resignation comes soon after the well-publicized firing
of New Republic associate editor Stephen Glass, who was caught
fabricating information in numerous stories. He left the magazine
in May, and The New Republic later issued an explanation and
apology to its readers.
Yeary joined Salomon Brothers in 1990 where, as a member of the
firm's well-regarded telecommunications group, he worked on some of
the most visible deals in the sector. He participated in a number
of major transactions at Salomon, including SBC Communications
Inc.'s purchases of Ameritech Corp. and Pacific Telesis and the
sale of McCaw Cellular Communications to ATT Corp.
Yeary is expected to open a New York office for the
Washington-based Carlyle Group, which has invested $7 billion in
more than 40 transactions in the United States.
Responding to two published reports by the New York Times and
the Associated Press that he is on the verge of becoming
permanent commissioner, Selig told the Globe Thursday that he
remains undecided.
This came on the heels of a Times report that the search
committee appointed in January 1997 has decided there is no one
better qualified for the job than Selig, baseball's acting boss
since the owners forced out the last full-time commissioner, Fay
Vincent, in September 1992. The Times said Selig would assume the
commissionership on a full-time basis this year, perhaps by the
All-Star Game in Denver July 7.
Selig reinforced that position when contacted by the Globe though he did not rule out taking the job at some point.
The owners already have expressed wide backing for one of their
own, though Selig's daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb, has been running
the Brewers' operation since her father assumed the commissioner's
duties. And the burden may be reduced because baseball now has its
first full-time CEO, Paul Beeston, in place.
