In taking a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game series, Chicago
ran the Jazz off its home floor after splitting two games in Salt
Lake City last week. With victories here in Games 4 and 5, the
Bulls could claim their sixth title in eight years without going
back to Utah.
The Jazz? Against the smothering defense of Harper, Jordan and
Scottie Pippen, Stockton and Malone executed the
pick-and-roll-over. They combined for 12 turnovers, and they did
not play in the fourth quarter as the Bulls ran up the score and
began laughing and high-fiving on the bench.
The closest a team had come to looking this futile was when
Indiana scored 55 points against San Antonio in a regular-season
game last March 29. In the playoffs, teams had scored as few as 64
points four times.
Utah committed 26 turnovers and was outrebounded, 50-38. It was
down by 18 points at halftime and trailed by 72-45 after three
quarters. Toni Kukoc (16 points, 6 rebounds and 4 steals) and
Pippen (10 points, 4 rebounds and 4 assists) were the perfect
complements to Jordan.
They moved in synchronization, each player finding a seam or
angle to the rim. Yes, Jordan scored more points than anyone else,
24. But he invariably does that. To elevate his contributions above
those of his teammates would not do justice to the symphony the
Bulls were playing.
The Bulls played like the team the Jazz used to be: patient,
poised and potent with the ball in their hands.
The Jazz also set futility marks for the largest loss in a
finals game, surpassing Washington's 35-point blowout of Seattle in
1978, and for the fewest number of field goals in a game (21) and
points in a half (23).
Stockton has not been a factor the past two games. With Harper's
flailing arms and Pippen's ability to move his feet quicker than
the Utah point guard can dribble, he could not get the Jazz offense
kick-started.
The end of the third quarter was a carbon copy of the first
half, with Harper and Scott Burrell throwing down dunks as the
Bulls bounded out to a 72-45 lead. The building was electric, loud
enough to make you wonder if the Jazz didn't feel like the
tomato-can opponent in a heavyweight title fight instead of the
worthy contender that deserved to be here.
Sloan, who implied after Game 2 that his team was a bunch of
softies, called a timeout and looked at his players as if he did
not know them. The team that took care of Shaquille O'Neal's Lakers
in four straight games to win the Western Conference championship
had been reduced to the Denver Nuggets playing here in January.
