But as the veterans in the field can attest, getting there and
staying there are two different things. Stewart won his first U.S.
Open in 1991 and then didn't win again on tour until the 1995 Shell
Houston Open. And he hasn't won since. Still, Stewart has played
some good golf this year and said he felt his game was U.S.
Open-ready coming into this week.
Of course, 4 under par is even better. Stewart ended his first
round with a flourish. After making eight consecutive pars, Stewart
cut lose with a 9-iron for his third shot on the par-5 16th hole,
hitting it to within eight inches and birdie.
Then came his most heroic effort of the day. The 17th hole is a
monster hole, measuring out at 468 yards for a par-4. Any golfer in
the field would gladly take par there and leave. But Stewart let
his 2-iron run up 15 feet onto the green, and then he drained a
45-foot putt for birdie.
Stewart appeared headed for trouble on No. 18, when he sent his
2-iron into the right rough and then left his 8-iron 12 feet from
the pin. But he sank the putt for his third birdie and couldn't
have been happier.
JASPER, TEXAS At dusk on Friday night, at the end of a
difficult week in the east Texas town of Jasper, 80 or so boys were
playing basketball in the park.
Two games were in progress, one at each net. Boys rose up,
caught air, dunked baskets. Cars were drawn up close to the court,
doors open, pumping out a heavy urban beat into the sultry air.
Every player was black, all the attendant girlfriends were black,
all the hangers-on were black. There was not a white in sight,
apart from this correspondent.
The scene, and the conversation, would not be unusual in
inner-city America. In a town of 8,000 people, it gives pause for
thought.
Jasper is a quiet, pretty place, with forests and lakes that
look more like Finland than Texas. Down one country road you pass a
creek, a meadow dappled in sunshine, then you go on into dense
emerald forest.
This spot is where the last sinews on James Byrd's neck tore
loose and his head the face already shredded on the tarmac bounced off into a ditch.
The murder by three white men of Byrd, a happy-go-lucky black
man known in Jasper for singing songs and hitching rides, has
reminded Jasper and the rest of America that relations between
the races are as vexed as ever.
