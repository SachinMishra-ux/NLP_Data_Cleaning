The mission of the young agents, who wear black uniforms, is
more specifically targeted at other young people. (To publish this 400-word article from the International Herald

BEIRUT In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians and a large number
of Israelis fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
This fantasy all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds perhaps thousands dead.
Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
