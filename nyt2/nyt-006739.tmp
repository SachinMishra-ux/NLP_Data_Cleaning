The Total Plan calls for measures to encourage the banks to sell
the properties and remove both the loans and the collateral from
their books. This may be a wrenching process, for the sale of so
much real estate could drive property prices lower, and the
obligation to face up to the problems could force weak banks out of
business. This could be another blow to confidence in the Japanese
economy.
But supporters say that the plan at least offers a way out of
the mess, even if it is a risky and laborious passage.
This would be the clearest break from the current system in
which all banks, strong and weak, are pulled along together by the
government.
The government already has a Resolution and Collection Bank,
which can absorb failed institutions, but its activities are not
comprehensive enough to deal fully with bankrupt banks.
Ryuji Konishi, an economic consultant and former banking
executive who favors the idea, compares the bridge bank to a
fishnet that catched only the fish too weak to swim away on their
own.
Not surprisingly, the weak banks are extremely sensitive to this
proposal because they do not want to be, in effect, taken over by
the government.
Earlier this year, the government also put together a $221
billion bank bailout that would support depositors and help the
banks rebuild their capital.
But the banks have drawn only 1.8 trillion yen. Weak banks are
reluctant to ask for money for fear that such an admission of
weakness would drive down their share prices.
Some foreign investors would like to see the government put up
even more than 30 trillion yen, either through a bridge bank or
another rescue package.
