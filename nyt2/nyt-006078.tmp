HKN-CUP-NOTES (Washington) The NHL's general managers are
recommending some key rule changes that would be implemented during

June 25.
Still, Billington sometimes manages to go beyond the obligatory the Hermitage, the Kremlin, the larger-than-life rulers from
Catherine the Great to Lenin. He takes us to a tiny, pristine
country church, and to the grandiose Church of the Transfiguration,
with its bouquet of 22 onion domes and its 30,000 hand-hewn wooden
shingles. The Church of the Transfiguration is on a remote island
where it couldn't have been seen by many: It was built for God, not
man.
Enormity and excess are among the themes Billington treats in
this televised tapestry. Take bells. In Christianized Russia, they
conveyed the Lord's message, and because their power only extended
as far as their sound, they got bigger and bigger until Russia had
the biggest bell in the world, which is still ensconced in Moscow's
Kremlin. It has never been rung, because it is too heavy to get off
the ground.
Icons were the first art that Russia made her own, and it's with
icons that Billington begins, showing us mournful images of a grave
and tender mother of God cheek-to-cheek with a Christ who is a
miniature adult rather than a child. One of the show's strengths is
the chance it gives us to see icons not as we would in a museum static, hung against a white wall, behind glass but in use, being
paraded in streets, being prayed to.
The icons that survived Stalin are often in sad shape, covered
in soot from worshippers' candles. While the fall of Communism
meant that icons could be freely exhibited once again, there is
little money to restore them. Skipping through the centuries,
Billington notes how important ancient icons were to such early
20th century giants of Russian art as Kandinsky and Tatlin. And he
shows contemporary icon painters at work, grinding precious lapis
and malachite into rich pigments bound with the yolks of eggs. The
desire of these artists whose lives have seen so much upheaval to
make art that will last a thousand years is a touching contrast
with their peers in the West, many of whom don't mind making art
that is short-lived either by intent or sloppy construction.
