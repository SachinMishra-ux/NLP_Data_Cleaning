In the time it has taken the Granada Hills High Class of 1998 to
go from diapers to diplomas, Elway has finished second in the
Heisman Trophy balloting, to Herschel Walker in 1982, earned an
undergraduate degree in economics, played for the New York Yankees'
Single-A team, been named to six Pro Bowls, played in four Super
Bowls and engineered 45 come-from-behind game-winning drives. The
most recent of those drives, in January, produced his first Super
Bowl win, over the defending champion Green Bay Packers.
He married his college sweetheart, fathered four children and
became the favorite son of an entire football-crazed state. But he
remained grounded even as his profile soared. A regular at the
Highlanders' annual alumni baseball game, Elway also has kept in
close touch with the friends he had made while playing prep
football.
The feeling apparently was mutual for some 50 former teammates
who honored Elway with their presence Thursday. He firmly
demonstrated where his priorities stood, turning down David
Letterman, who wanted him to do a stand-up spot after the ceremony
for Letterman's late-night telecast, so he could spend the time
catching up with his longtime friends before catching a flight back
to Denver with his pint-sized sidekick, his 8-year-old son Jack.
Elway was the seventh speaker fitting since that's his jersey
number and he delivered the verbal equivalent of a long touchdown
spiral, his inspirational message connecting with most of his
audience. Sadly, there was a section of students in the bleachers
to his right who seemed far more interested in hearing themselves
talk than Elway.
Those with the good manners and good sense to listen were
treated to Elway's prescription for success: Be humble; seize every
opportunity; persevere and identify what it is you do best and do
it to the best of your abilities.
A more eloquent earful no senior can hope to get from any
commencement speaker this or any spring.
Elway's net worth extends into nine figures, but money isn't
what makes this man. Someone driven by the bottom line would have
no reason to place the occasional long-distance call of
encouragement to football players at his old high school, always on
his own dime and time.
He wouldn't think of making a long day longer by showing up
early to the gymnasium on the day he was being honored to address a
group of football players with whom he shares only a legacy.
Someone driven by the bottom line wouldn't dream of standing in
a stuffy gymnasium at 9 in the morning, sleep still in his eyes,
patiently and pleasantly signing every last autograph and posing
for every last picture, obliging many of the faculty members who
had just gotten through telling their students not to pester him
for autographs or pictures.
And someone driven by the bottom line certainly wouldn't hold
the admiration of two sophomores who are vying to be the next in a
long line of storied Highlanders quarterbacks.
