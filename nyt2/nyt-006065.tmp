How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
The hostility toward Deborah Eappen surprised Caryl Rivers, a
Boston University professor and author of a new book on two-career
families. It seemed to suggest that, counter to some of Rivers'
research, society wasn't so comfortable with working mothers after
all.
Blame fell on Deborah Eappen not simply for being at work when
her baby had to be rushed to the hospital but for allegedly
exploiting Woodward, who was paid $115 to work 45 hours per week,
even though the Eappens had the added expense of Woodward's travel
and agency fees.
When, at trial, Woodward's legal team got a neurosurgeon to
admit that serum leaked from eight-month old Matthew Eappen's wound a sign that the injury might have occurred long before he lapsed
into a coma many of Woodward's defenders blamed the Eappens for
accusing a working-class girl from economically faltering Elton,
England.
In the offices and living rooms of Massachusetts, some people
took sides on the merits of the case, with their sentiments falling
along class lines. Cocktail parties hummed with disgust over the
way Woodward's defenders were casting blame on a working mother.
Bars thundered with anger over Reilly's hubris in charging the girl
with anything at all.
When Woodward, looking every inch the apple-cheeked schoolgirl,
took the stand to deny hurting Matthew Eappen, she won over her
countrymen. But many wondered: Would her stiff upper lip, which
impressed folks back home as a show of fortitude, come off as cold
to a jury in the more emotive US?
Any notion that Woodward lacked emotions evaporated the night
before Halloween, when she screamed and nearly collapsed after the
jury, revealing its decision in mid-evening, declared her guilty of
murder in the second degree.
