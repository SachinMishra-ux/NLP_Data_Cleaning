Perhaps an even bigger burden facing Selig is his own passion.
While Selig's baseball politics have been questioned on occasion,
his love for the game rarely is. And that makes him a lock to be
bitten by the worst bug of all commissioneritis, a disease that
consumes any office-holder who actually cares. Commissioners who
believe the game should adhere to a higher standard and shoot for
something loftier than the bottom line are especially vulnerable.
Sadly, this malady is rarely avoided, or rewarded, for that matter.
Do the things that you skewered Fay Vincent, the last idealistic
commissioner, for trying to do. Hold the game's import above all
else. Care as much about the bottom line of the fan, who frets as
much over the cost of cold hot dogs as you do about the battles
between millionaires and billionaires.
Don't forsake the moral standard that includes issues ranging
from civil rights in the front offices to the lack of civility that
spitting on umpires suggests.
Be not only a peacemaker but an innovator by insisting the game
stop slaughtering the images of its biggest assets. Promote the
players who are more than worthy of the game's attention. Make kids
want not only to be like Mike, but like McGwire, as well. Make the
Griffeys and Piazzas true partners and allow the players and their
representatives a fair say in growing the game.
Do these things and you will stop the groaning that seems
never-ending if only because the sport stirs so many emotions on so
many different levels and issues on a daily basis.
None of the above will be easy. It isn't supposed to be. Yet,
since Selig is finally willing to accept the job, he must accept
the challenges to try to make a difference even when intransigence
is the safer bet. That's what constitutes doing what is in the best
interest of baseball, the one element of the job that never
changes.
Yes, Selig could be summarily dismissed for succumbing to the
essence of the job. The good ones usually are. But that's okay if
Selig comes and goes never having failed to weigh what is right as
opposed to what is safe. It is all the fans, the owners, the
players, the umpires can and should ask. It is all Bud Selig should
ask of himself.
The world championships have become the latest battleground in
the labor strife between the players and the owners. After the
players voted unanimously to boycott the event last week in the
event of a lockout, USA Basketball announced Tuesday it would send
an alternate team to Athens, one probably composed of players not
in the National Basketball Association.
With no deal in sight, the owners are expected to lock out the
players on July 1 the day after the collective bargaining
agreement expires.
DEAR PRETENTIOUS ANSWER MAN: Like, I am a 17-year-old high
school senior (after I finish summer school) working as a clerk at
a video store. Dude, there is this chick I work with who is, like,
SO hot.
