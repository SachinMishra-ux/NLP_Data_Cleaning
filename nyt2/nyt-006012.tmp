Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
