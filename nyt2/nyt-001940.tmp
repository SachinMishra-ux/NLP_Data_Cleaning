Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
