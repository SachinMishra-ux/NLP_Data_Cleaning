ORLANDO, Fla. With record high temperatures and a prolonged
drought, Florida has been struck by at least 137 wildfires that in
just the last three weeks have burned more than 49,000 acres in 34
counties and injured at least 14 people.
With the situation worsening, President Clinton declared the
entire state a disaster area on Friday, opening the door for
emergency assistance. The declaration, which had originally applied
to only eight counties in the hardest hit areas, in northern and
central Florida, enables fire victims to seek low-cost federal aid.
At least 137 fires in 34 of Florida's 67 counties since May 25
have caused an estimated $13 million in losses statewide.
Earlier in the week, a fire forced the evacuation of 1,100
people from Waldo, near Gainesville in northern Florida. But by
Friday evening, cars were returning to Waldo under clear skies and
a lingering smell of smoke.

CLINTON-TRIP When he visits China beginning next week,
virtually everything President Clinton does every step he takes,
every place he goes, every bite he eats will have been
choreographed weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women
who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending
hours studying videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret
Service agents will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and
air ducts blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting
bombs. His armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead.
Hotels will have been comandeered for the president and his
entourage. Detailed briefing books will have been prepared for him,
providing classified information on the ranking officials with whom
he will meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the
traveling White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will
have been installed so the media can beam images back to the United
States. In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around
the clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make
sure the whole thing goes off without a hitch. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
IRAN-SOCCER TEHRAN, Iran The U.S. plays Iran in the World
Cup soccer tournament Sunday. Except when Iraq is in crisis, Iran
is probably the biggest story in the Middle East right now. There
were huge street celebrations when Iran qualified for the
tournament. People said they bordered on political outbursts, and
there was concern among Iran's Islamic fundamentalist rulers when
many women celebrants removed their head coverings in violation of
religious dictates. Many other Iranians hope the match will lead to
a normalization of relations between the United States and Iran
after two decades of hostility. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

NORLEANS New Orleans First it was the mardi gras pay-to-ride
float, then the death of the KB drug stores to Rite Aid. Now
Starbucks is about to come in and all the local coffee houses are
shakin in their mocha. Is America's most European city starting to
look more like, well, America? (Rochell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
