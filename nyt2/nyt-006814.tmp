Yet the cabin offers delights along with irritations. The
two-tone leather is gorgeous, but the black-stained walnut trim is
rather gloomy. The firm seats, with big side bolsters they also
house the side-impact air bags are sporty, but
larger-than-average drivers may find them confining.
And my biggest gripe about the C70 is a serious lack of legroom,
a deficiency not apparent in the specifications but one also
noticed by two other 6-foot-1 men who sat behind the wheel.
The head restraints, however, are exemplary perhaps the best
on any car. High and close to the head, they should help prevent
whiplash injuries even for tall drivers, and they are comfortable
to boot.
The C70 does have some agreeable amenities. The steering wheel
tilts and telescopes. The Dolby Surround Sound stereo, $595 on top
of the not-so-basic standard system (400-watt amplifier, 10
speakers and a handy, three-disk, in-dash CD changer), is
electrifying comparable with the terrific Bose system in the new
Cadillac Seville. But the Volvo unit includes a strange-looking
speaker that protrudes above the dash.
The shift knob is polished wood, but the automatic-transmission
version is ringed with plastic, and that is what your hand feels.
The door pockets are too shallow to be useful, and the console box
under the center armrest is just big enough for a couple of CD
cases. And the armrest/storage lid also houses what may be the
world's dumbest cup holder: It slides out to hold two medium
containers, but should you lift the lid to reach into the box, your
beverage spills onto the passenger.
More thought has gone into the instruments. Markings on the fuel
gauge tell how many gallons of gas remain. The trip computer is a
wonder of simplicity, with various readouts displayed at the twist
of a dial.
And what's this? Instead of the digital mumbo-jumbo, electronic
slide-rules and up-down buttons that have spread like kudzu through
cars, Volvo has come up with a wonderful invention for tuning the
radio, adjusting the volume and setting the temperature. It is
called a knob, and drivers who would rather watch the road than
grope for tiny buttons will find it refreshingly retro.
As for safety, there are front and rear fog lights, daytime
running lights and headlamp washer/wipers. But if the car isn't
started after the doors are unlocked, ostensibly within two
minutes, they re-lock.
A colleague discovered this after tossing keys, purse and money
on the seat, closing the door and walking around the car in well
under two minutes, she insists. Locked out and angry, she waited
for a locksmith and wondered what she would have done if a child
had been confined inside.
Configured for four occupants there is a mini-console between
the rear foot wells this coupe treats rear passengers pretty
well. The biggest problem with the back seat is the front seats you need two hands to tilt the heavy, clunky seatbacks. To move the
entire seat forward, you pull up on the latch and hold it for what
seems like ages, since the motorized seat is painfully slow.
