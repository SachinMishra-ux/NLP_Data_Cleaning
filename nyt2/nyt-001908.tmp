Yes, it's been a long ride. And a long time since the Bulls were
in a predicament like this. Dan Bickley can be reached at dan.bickley(at)pni.com. 
SALT LAKE CITY While the Chicago Bulls snipe at each other,
the Utah Jazz has remained all quiet on the Wasatch Front.
And why not? Despite getting subpar performances from two of its
top three players Karl Malone and Jeff Hornacek in Game 1, Utah
leads the best-of-seven NBA Finals series, 1-0, going into Game 2
tonight at the Delta Center.
But the Jazz also knows that, to beat the Bulls, it's going to
need a lot more from Malone and Hornacek. John Stockton carried the
team, especially down the stretch, in Game 1.
Malone, who had a similarly poor performance in Game 1 of the
1997 Finals, made only 9 of 25 shots this year. He said he'll make
a few minor adjustments but expects his shots to start falling.
For Hornacek, who made only 2 10 shots, it's not so simple.
First, he has to expend a lot of energy trying to guard Bulls star
Michael Jordan.
Second, Hornacek is not healthy, even if he insists that he is.
Hornacek has had a chronically bad left knee, admitting that it has
been swelling off and on for the past seven seasons. This season,
he also has sore Achilles' tendons during the playoffs that have
limited his mobility and made it difficult for him to shoot his
jump shot with normal lift and rhythm.
And Hornacek really started wondering whether he's star-crossed
last week. With that 10-day respite, Hornacek not only had a rare
opportunity to let his body rest, he also had a chance to get some
work done around the house. It turned out to be a bad idea.
Hornacek took a dive, and and the ladder whacked him in the
head. He needed a half-dozen stitches.
Not as rough as the Bulls' start in this series, though. Jordan
scored 33 points and Scottie Pippen had 21, but neither shot the
ball well, and Pippen had five turnovers. And the rest of the Bulls
were mostly ineffective. Forward Toni Kukoc made only 4 of 12
shots. Guard Ron Harper scored four points and had only one assist
in 24 minutes.
