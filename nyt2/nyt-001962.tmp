Baptist conservatives who insist on male leadership can take
some lessons from the Mormon leaders they will be visiting in the
next few days.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like the most
conservative of Baptists, does not allow women to be pastors or
priests. None of the ruling hierarchy of Mormons is a woman.
Mormons, conservative Baptists, and some Episcopalians and Roman
Catholics, for that matter, use the argument that because Jesus' 12
apostles were all males, priestly leaders of the church should all
be males.
So conservative Baptists and Mormons, although at odds over many
theological matters, will be in agreement this week about keeping
women in their submissive places.

MOSCOW President Boris Yeltsin finds himself in a country
which does not actually belong to or obey him any more.
This is not only because it has become apparent that the Russian
president, as true of Mikhail Gorbachev once, feels much more
comfortable abroad than in his homeland.
By winning the race for governor last month in the vast,
mineral-rich, southern Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, Lebed, the
48-year-old, high-profile, former paratroop general, also wins
himself a place in Russia's presidential elections in the year
2000.
By now it seems that not merely Lebed won a new place in
Russia's national limelight. Another factor won: It is the new hope
which has won out. Should Lebed prove to be able to maintain this
hope until Russia's presidential elections, he will enter the
Kremlin, sweeping aside all the other candidates including the
beleaguered Yeltsin or any Yeltsin-backed candidates.
Not long ago, of course, this military man, as commander of the
14th army division, used his power and influence to finally put a
stop to the bloody Chechen war. For that, he earned not the
congratulations, but the enmity of Yeltsin, who saw in it the
ambition of a rival to be president. As such Yeltsin sacked Lebed
from his job as Russia's top national security adviser.
