Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1995, critics
have said Hynes has an eat-your-cake-and-have-it-too position. Some
of them trace his position to a desire to win votes in the
hurly-burly of Brooklyn politics, a borough that includes the
liberal bastions of Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, the
politically conservative Orthodox Jewish enclaves and the
politically crucial black and Hispanic neighborhoods, where the
death penalty can be a volatile issue.
In the interview, Hynes denied that he had pursued the death
penalty for political reasons. But he acknowledged the obvious
distress of the jurors after the death sentence was announced for
Darrel Harris, a former jail guard once cited for heroism who was
convicted of a triple homicide.
Whatever Hynes' motives, his role as a prosecutor who seeks the
death penalty while remaining personally opposed to it has been
part of a winning political formula in Brooklyn. In 1997, during
his third successful campaign to be prosecutor of New York City's
most populous borough, he won with not only the Democratic and
Liberal Party designations but with the Republican nomination as
well.
For district attorneys, who must stand for election even if they
do not have larger political ambitions, the state's reinstatement
of the death penalty in 1995 created a political minefield.
Each of the city's district attorneys has steered through it
exceedingly carefully. Their views range from outright support for
the death penalty, expressed by District Attorney William Murphy of
Staten Island, to cautious opposition, expressed by District
Attorney Robert Johnson of the Bronx.
And many lawyers have concluded that the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau, is shrewdly sabotaging the law.
Morgenthau, a longtime death-penalty opponent, has said he is
evaluating each case on its merits. But he has yet to ask for the
penalty after considering the question in a dozen cases. The Queens
district attorney, Richard Brown, has said he is opposed to the
death penalty but has sought it in at least two cases.
In the Bronx, that stance proved popular; Johnson was
overwhelmingly re-elected later that year. But in 1996, Pataki
removed Johnson from a case involving the killing of a police
officer and appointed state Attorney General Dennis Vacco; the case
never went to trial because the defendant committed suicide.
Norman Siegel, a death-penalty opponent who is executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Saturday's
verdict opened the door to a new era of executions in New York
state. Hynes, as the prosecutor who has been most active in seeking
death sentences, bears some responsibility for that no matter what
his own views are, Siegel said.
For any prosecutor with statewide ambitions, Pataki's victory in
his battle with Johnson made the politics of death-penalty choices
clear: Seek the death penalty or risk being tarred as an
obstructionist.
An obstructionist posture might win support from staunch
death-penalty opponents. But it was also likely to galvanize
proponents and make them active political enemies.
