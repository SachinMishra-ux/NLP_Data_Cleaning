Mainstream publications such as Consumer Reports or Money
magazine may not be popular in ethnic communities, but there are
some places where consumers can get objective noncommercial
information in their native languages.
Consumer Action offers a variety of free brochures about credit,
insurance, investing and other consumer issues in English, Spanish,
Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.
Bank Rate Monitor later this week will introduce a
Spanish-language version of its Web site at www.bankrate.com, which
will provide news and free rate information about mortgages, home
equity loans, auto loans, credit cards, and savings and checking
accounts.
 Whether shopping for a new credit card or an auto loan,
consumers should do their homework before spending their money. And
if English is their second language, they should demand disclosures
in their native language or ask someone they trust to translate the
materials.
BOSTON John Wasdin said he had been looking forward to making
the trip to Atlanta for quite some time. After all, his family had
planned a reunion around the Red Sox' three-game set vs. the Braves
beginning Monday night. From Tallahassee to Jacksonville, Wasdins
all over Florida were ready to make the trek north to converge upon
Ted Turner Field to watch their favorite Boston pitcher.
Plane reservations had been confirmed. Hotel rooms booked. And,
yes, there were even plans for a family trip to Six Flags. But then
something came up last Wednesday night that caused a major glitch
in Wasdin's plans for a happy family reunion.
Wasdin smiled and laughed. He could afford to do so, especially
since he got his ticket to ride to Atlanta when the Red Sox
recalled him some 24 hours after sending him down to the minors.
The roster spot became available when Dennis Eckersley was placed
on the 15-day disabled list.
Wasdin said he was scheduled to start for Pawtucket Sunday. Upon
his arrival in Pawtucket, he telephoned pitching coach Joe Kerrigan
to get his throwing assignment, but was told to hold off and report
back to Fenway Park Thursday, because something might be up with
Eck's arm.
While it also helped lower Wasdin's ERA to 5.35, it did little
to improve his hits-to-innings-pitched ratio, which is 39 to 33
2/3.
CHICAGO The highlights of Sunday night's game will be
condensed into a few choice plays, like Michael Jordan's one-armed
magic against Greg Ostertag or the full-court pass by Dennis
Rodman, and rightly so. NBA greatness is always defined by scoring.
With a few choice words Magic's hook, West's bomb, or merely
Garfield Heard you're right back in the moment.
