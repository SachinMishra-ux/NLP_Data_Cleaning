What a five-week trip it was for Real Quiet's people, especially
for the 46-year-old Pegram. He was Jed Clampett on Rodeo Drive. He
rang the opening bell the other day on Wall Street. He stopped to
sleep when he could.
A sniff short of history, Real Quiet will go down as the 14th
horse to win the first two legs of the Triple Crown before being
denied here. Bought for $17,000 at a yearling sale and unimpressive
as a 2-year-old, he may be recalled modestly unless he certifies
his excellence the next couple of years.
Pegram's imprint may be more lasting. His party was the
personification of his tweaking of horse racing's establishment. He
interrupted a conversation once to join a dice game.
Pegram hopes the industry doesn't miss the message of his
campaign with Real Quiet. Some 80,162 fans flooded the Belmont,
second-largest crowd in the track's 93-year history.
It is Pegram's contention that some of the lag in racing
interest has been caused by the industry's unresponsiveness to the
masses.
Will this experience change Pegram? Will he be tempted to raise
the ante at a yearling sale in an attempt to hit it big once more?
Now he was accepting a string of hugs and thanks for the party,
and also for the ride. He was having fun, the best way Mike Pegram
knows to wash away the pain.
LOS ANGELES Veronica Martinez spent five hours in a jail where
she wasn't fed lunch and her cellmate was a drugged-out woman with
a queasy stomach.
Then she was led in handcuffs from her cell to a courtroom in
L.A.'s San Fernando Valley.
But the 25-year-old woman from the suburb of Tujunga was not a
criminal suspect. In fact, prosecutors said, she was the victim.
