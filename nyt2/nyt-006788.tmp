Right now, America Online charges users a $22 monthly fee for
both access to the Internet and its own content. Portal services
like Infoseek and Snap have been free to users. But Winebaum of
Disney said the company hopes to come up with extra services for
which users will pay fees. Disney's ESPN site earns half its
revenue, for example, from add-on services like fantasy sports
leagues.
Even as the big media companies are buying the existing portal
sites, many other companies of all sorts are jockeying for position
to earn money as Internet Gateways. Smaller sites that began
offering specialized services are now trying to emulate the look
and features of sites like Yahoo.
The most feared is Microsoft's Start, because it will be the
first page seen by users of the Internet Explorer browser software
that is now part of the Windows operating system. Meanwhile
Netscape, whose software business has been devastated by Microsoft,
has been trying to turn its often visited but dreary home page into
a service with as much news and information as the other portal
sites.
And Compaq Computer is even trying to turn its products into
portals by installing several buttons on its computer keyboards
that direct users to certain Web sites.
Analysts said that all these moves represent the massing of
forces for what will shape up to be a long and brutal war over
which two or three portal services will become dominant.
With the stakes in the online world far lower a few years ago,
America Online spent a $1 billion on television advertising and
distribution of sign-up disks to surge past its rivals, Prodigy and
Compuserve.
TOKYO In a few weeks Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will
face nationwide elections as he presides over the worst recession
in more than 50 years, a limp stock market and the highest
unemployment rate since records began to be kept.
Yet experts overwhelmingly expect his governing Liberal
Democratic Party to do very well. The latest polls show it with
more than five times as much support as any other party.
Now Hashimoto is more likely than ever to do well, for President
Clinton handed him a political gift on Wednesday by agreeing to a
joint U.S.-Japanese campaign to bolster the sagging yen. Whether
the jawboning and billions of dollars in foreign-exchange
intervention succeed in propping up the yen, they will almost
certainly succeed in propping up Hashimoto.
The premise of Clinton's decision to go to Hashimoto's aid was
that Japan would take, as Clinton put it, aggressive and bold steps
that would justify a higher rate for the yen. But many analysts
here say that the Japanese political process militates against
fundamental change and that Hashimoto's relative popularity
suggests that the public wants someone like him, a repairman for
the old system rather than an architect for a new one.
