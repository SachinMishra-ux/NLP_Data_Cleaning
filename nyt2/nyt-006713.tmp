ANSWER: Oh, no. You have to remember that I wanted to do this
when I was 8 years old. When I was in college, I got a job in
Washington D.C. as a staff announcer. And that, I thought, was a
major step in the right direction. Then I was offered a permanent
job as a staff announcer in Washington. And each of those steps, I
thought, was the beginning of the end.
It was the best. And then, to get the Dodger job was
overwhelming. But to even project beyond my opening day of my first
season, no, you never think what's going to happen, will I survive.
Nothing like that at all, no.
A: I think a man is defined by his job. You say, `There's
so-and-so the doctor, there's so-and-so the lawyer, there's
so-and-so in construction, there's so-and-so the sports announcer.'
I think your job, certainly for a man, becomes part of him, and
vice-versa.
Q: Your voice alone has become such a big part of life for many
people in Southern California. You're in their living rooms via the
television. You're in their cars via the radio. Can you understand
how so many people seem to feel they know you?
A: I hope they do. I really hope they do. I'm extremely aware of
two things. My good fortune, for which I have overwhelming
gratitude. And the other is I know I have a big responsibility. I
have a responsibility to all those people you just mentioned who
watch and who listen.
I try extremely hard, as best that I can, to come to work well
rested, well studied, having done homework. I try so hard to be as
accurate as humanly possible. All of that because of the
combination of gratitude for the job and also the feeling that I
owe these people. I have a tremendous obligation.
A: Well no, not really. Not to define favorite. I would say --
and I think you could understand -- when I first started, I started
with the Boys of Summer. And so when I look back on those younger,
more impressionable days, that team had a tremendous impact on me.
Campanella, Hodges, Robinson, Reese, Cox, Snider, Furillo,
Newcombe, Erskine, Branca, the list goes on and on. So that team
has meant a great deal. The other thing, that team stayed together
for a while. So that would be a favorite.
The 1988 team, that seemed to be the most fortunate Dodger team
I've ever seen. I will always think of that team as a team of good
fortune.
And of course, the first time the Dodgers won a championship
here (1959). I will also think of that as something precious and
special.
