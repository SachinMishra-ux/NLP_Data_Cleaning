Checchi's ads swamped the airwaves but did not work, suggesting
there may be a natural limit to the usefulness of spending money on
commercials (the tactic which most inflates the cost of political
campaigning in America).
Above all, California has shown that voters can usually be
trusted: in all the agonizing over campaign-finance reform, perhaps
the only vital rule is that they should know where a candidate's
money comes from.
Also on Tuesday, Californians voted to end the state's program
of bilingual education, by which non-English-speaking children are
taught in their own language for several years.
This costly program, the largest of its kind in the country, had
patently failed to reduce the dropout rate of Latino high-school
children.
Latino parents supported the proposal almost as heartily as
Anglos, and for a simple reason: in America, despite the currency
of Spanish, English is the language of advancement.
There was another, equally sensible, reason for this vote. In
recent years, California has turned against any kind of
preferential treatment for minorities. In 1996, it became the first
state to bar racial preferences in state hiring and contracting and
in admissions to state universities, a bold move that deserved more
imitators on the national scene.
The bilingual vote is an extension of this policy. California's
voters now believe that after many years of trying to assist blacks
and Latinos by applying admissions quotas or easier standards, the
proper approach is to spend more money on education at earlier
stages and across the board.
With a booming economy and a $4 billion budget surplus, there is
money at last for improving the state's lagging schools; and, with
it, the confidence to defy entrenched bodies, such as the teachers'
unions, that stand in the way of color-blind reforms.
Not everything went smoothly on election day. Californians
turned down a proposal that union members should give their
approval before their dues are spent for political purposes: a
victory for labor that will have national implications.
Turnout, at less than 40 percent, showed that relentless
campaigning-by-television has dulled the taste for taking part in
politics.
