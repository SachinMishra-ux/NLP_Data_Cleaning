That was 25 years ago. Secretariat, with Ron Turcotte in the
saddle, was expected to be threatened by Sham, a terrific colt
ridden by Lafitte Pincay.
The Triple Crown and more than $5 million in bonus purses await
a victory by Real Quiet on Saturday. But whether the pace is fast
or slow, this will be the Belmont's anniversary waltz. Fifty years
after Citation's stunning victory, 25 for Secretariat and 20 for
Affirmed. Since 1984, no Belmont winner has won it wire to wire,
and none has come from more than four lengths back in the final
half-mile.
A year ago, Touch Gold trailed with a furlong to go, and roared
past Silver Charm at the finish, denying Bob Baffert a Triple
Crown. He is the first trainer in this century to win the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness in back-to-back years, and he believes the
Belmont owes him one. He is 0-for-7 in New York.
Anyone who has walked past a stable will tell you horses have a
personality, even an attitude. After Secretariat's triple, Mrs.
Chenery, then known as Penny Tweedy, commissioned the artist LeRoy
Neiman to paint a mural of Big Red.
A friend walked in while he was standing in front of his
unfinished work, hands resting on his hips.
Then he stepped forward, with one stroke added a white line
across the canvas the rail and the painting came alive.
Advice is plentiful at the track, but the great ones, horses or
jockeys or trainers, go their own way.
GLEN SPEY, N.Y. In this tiny hamlet where about a quarter of
the residents are elderly Ukrainians, the few people who knew
Dmytro Sawczuk were more sympathetic then alarmed about the news
that the federal government had moved to revoke his citizenship
because he apparently lied about his Nazi past when he immigrated
to this country 50 years ago.
Sawczuk, now 73, said he had been a sawmill worker in Germany
and a farmer in his native Poland, in an area of the country
divided between the Russians and Germans during World War II. But
according to the Justice Department's office of special
investigation, which handles cases of suspected war criminals and
collaborators, Sawczuk had been a guard at a succession of Nazi
labor and death camps from 1943 to 1945.
Melnyk lives on a street named for a prominent Ukrainian, in a
neighborhood where little English is heard. Down the country road
are two Ukrainian churches, one Orthodox and one Catholic, built to
mimic the folk architecture of the wooden churches in the
Carpathian Mountains. There is also a Ukrainian resort here, the
scene of an annual summer festival that draws more than 10,000
people from Ukrainian strongholds throughout the Northeast.
