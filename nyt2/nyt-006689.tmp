Of course, his has been a complicated transformation, given the
country's egalitarian tradition under communism, because the wave
of prosperity that has created a middle class has not carried all
Chinese equally. For every 30-year-old entrepreneur who has moved
up in social status, there are many more workers laid off from
ailing state-owned factories who have fallen.
The income gap between China's rich and poor is widening fast.
In Beijing last year, the average annual salary for bosses of
private companies was about $8,000 and for workers only $1,000,
said Dai Jianzheng, a sociologist at the Beijing Academy of Social
Science. The difference is even greater in the countryside.
She said that when her husband, a university professor, took the
$15,000, in cash, that she was paid for a screenplay to a local
bank recently, the other customers cursed him.
Although Chinese entrepreneurs began accumulating money in the
late 1980s, it was not until the mid-'90s that the accoutrements of
middle-class life cell phones, microwaves and a wide range of
cars were readily available for purchase in China. Then the
middle class really took off.
Some of the earliest entrants to the middle class, generally
young high-tech entrepreneurs who quit state enterprises to start
private companies nearly a decade ago, are now wealthy by any
country's standards.
The Dyne Group, with revenues of $240 million last year, now
sells computer systems and pharmaceuticals, and is branching out
into furniture.
Ms. Yan and Zhang live a life unthinkable a decade ago, with two
Mercedes, one Lincoln, one Ford and a villa in Beijing, a country
house and a third in Freemont, Calif., where their company has its
American office. Although Zhang would not disclose his own income,
he said that many of his senior executives now own houses. The
couple have been to Europe and Singapore, and only their busy work
schedule keeps them from traveling more often.
Like many newly rich Chinese they seem vaguely uncomfortable
when asked about wealth. Their favorite activity remains walking in
the mountains near Beijing and, following a common Chinese
practice, their 9-year-old daughter lives with her grandmother in
another part of Beijing, where she attends a public school.
For most Chinese the move into the middle class is still a
step-by-step process, with each choosing the components of
middle-class life he can afford.
At 8 a.m. on a recent Saturday morning a group of 20 friends and
colleagues boarded a bus for a resort near Baihuashan, for a
weekend of hiking, boating and karaoke. Young professionals in
their 20s and 30s, they had each paid $50 to join this rite of the
middle class.
