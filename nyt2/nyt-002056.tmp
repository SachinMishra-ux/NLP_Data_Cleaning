As for slipperiness, any smooth, hard, shiny surface is slippery
when wet, but Pergo is not necessarily slipperier than any other
surface. It is a matter of staying off a newly-washed floor until
it dries, and to wipe up liquid spills quickly (any spills, really)
before someone trips, slips and falls.
Q. I am having the clapboards of my old (1834) Greek Revival
house painted. I want white, but the painter said to paint it
yellow or blue to prevent nails from rusting. Do I really have to
make it yellow or blue?
A. Now, there is an old wives' tale to beat all old wives'
tales. If nails are rusting, color makes no difference; the rust
will come right through any paint. The only cure for rusting nails
is to pull each one and replace it with a stainless steel siding
nail, which, incidentally, will hold better than the old nails
anyway. Even dabbing a bit of metal primer over each nail will not
solve the problem.
Even if the nails are countersunk and filled with a filler of
some sort (and the rust is showing through the filter), the
condition is incurable except by replacing the nails. And because
the clapboards are only about 1/4 inch thick, the nails cannot be
deeply countersunk (or they'll go all the way through), and wood
filler will not hold very well in such a shallow hole.
Q. My small house is on a slab, with heat and air conditioning
coming from ducts in the ceiling. The paint is peeling on the
ceiling around the duct openings. How can I prevent that?
A. What is happening: Moist air in the ducts is condensing right
at the opening of the duct, which is cool, and spreading to the
ceiling, where the dampness is causing the peeling. So, check the
insulation on the attic floor to make sure it is snug against the
ducts, and make sure the ducts themselves are well insulated, with
no gaps. If the insulation seems flimsy (an inch or so thick), add
another layer of duct insulation and make sure all seams and holes
in the insulation are covered with duct tape or a similar tape that
will keep them sealed.
Then sand the peeling paint smooth and apply two thin coats of
latex ceiling paint. You may have to repaint the entire ceiling.
The paint also might have peeled because it was applied too
thickly, and that is why two thin coats will perform better and
resist peeling better than one or two thick coats.
Q. I am having a house built in New Hampshire, and I would like
two-inch-wide louvered strips in the soffits, the full length of
the soffits. Where can I find such strips?
A. I know of no building supply store or lumber store that does
not carry them. They are common, because such strips are the state
of the art for attic ventilation, in conjunction with ridge vents.
Such soffit strips are two inches wide and 10 feet long, and fit
easily into a two-inch-wide opening in the soffit. They are better
than an occasional louver, say 8 by 12 inches or 4 by 12 inches or
so, and are a lot better than the round louvers. The strips are
insect-proof, and are also better looking than any other louvered
device. They come in white and other colors. A black strip would
look good.
Another good soffit vent is a simple two- or three-inch-wide
opening, the full length of the soffit, screened with black
screening. The screening can go on the back of the soffit or on its
face. If it is applied to the face, a small molding trim should be
applied to cover the raw edges of the screen and to hold it in
place. Such a black screened vent will give the eaves an extra
architectural look. Addition of square or rectangular vents, or
worse yet, round louvers, will look like a jury rig.
