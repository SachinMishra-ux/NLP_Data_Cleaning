Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development a so-called incidental take permit that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
