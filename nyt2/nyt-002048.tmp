It may well be worth serious consideration when it arrives.
Daewoo, while not exactly a household word around here, has been
making cars for enough years to have a track record. The company is
well established in Australia and Asia.
The Daewoo Laganza test car was so fresh off the factory boat
that it didn't even have a license plate, just a temporary sticker
in the back window issued in California. Nor did it have much on
the odometer essentially the mileage from where the truck dropped
it to my digs. For this assessment, since Daewoo is looking toward
youth for sales potential, I turned to daughter of Auto Writer, who
at 29 no longer considers herself youthful which comment always
elicits a guffaw from Daddy Gray Hair.
We pulled onto Route 202 heading for Biddeford and the Maine
Turnpike via Sanford, discovering along the way that the
2.198-liter (134.1 CID) four-cylinder had some guts. Good, but not
flashy off the line, it offered some reserve for passing you
don't have much room for that on Maine's rural roads. The engine,
however, whines loudly when you demand passing power.
A five-speed manual is available, but the test vehicle came with
a four-speed automatic, a smooth shifter that, while it sapped a
bit of performance from the little engine, didn't overwhelm it.
The air conditioning had an automatic mode but seemed to offer
only two genuine settings: too cool or too warm. We agreed on the
cooler choice.
Window switches of the convenient push/pull type favored by the
Japanese makers were mounted on the doors. A power mirror switch is
on the left end of the dash. The glove box is small, but door bins,
a small covered bin between the seats, and pockets in the seat
backs helped with storage. A lid in front of the bin covers two
cupholders. The trunk is good got the acid test with a bookcase but the rear seats do not fold down to add cargo room. Legroom and
headroom are good front and rear, despite a sunroof with a sliding
inner panel opening that inner door brightened up the interior
considerably.
The ride up the coast was pleasant, the tour of Owls Head
Transportation Museum delightful although planes were being
taxied toward cover as rain threatened. The rain arrived and
thundered on the roof for a few minutes, ending in a burst of
sunlight. The ride back down the coast was pleasantly uneventful.
We stopped for dinner in Wiscasset, sadly eyeing the last remnants
of the abandoned schooners Hesper and Luther Little being uprooted
from the harbor bottom.
She slowed appropriately; the Daewoo splashed along. The AC had
achieved something of a comfort equilibrium. She had never needed
the antilock brakes; I used them later gratefully. She had lights
at home.
The storm passed as we hit Lowell, but I hit it again on my
return to the New Hampshire den I inhabit torrential rain, more
heavenly fireworks, and, finally, the sudden need for ABS because
someone else had proven ... unwise.
Only time will prove it, but the Daewoo looks like serious
competition. Daughter I can't call her the kid anymore is
checking the budget to see if, maybe .... Wait a year, kid.
