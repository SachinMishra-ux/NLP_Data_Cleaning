He can tell communities in western New York and the Catskills
that see casinos as their best hope for economic development that
he tried, but he did not push the issue hard enough to raise the
ire of conservatives who oppose gambling.
And he can tell minority communities that favor charter schools
that he fought their fight, only to be thwarted by the Assembly's
top Democrats, though the Republicans who control the Senate were
in no hurry to go down that road, either.
In a way, it was a year made for political posturing, and not
just because of the coming election. In years past, lawmakers often
hitched smaller issues to larger ones, giving them leverage to get
more things done.
But this year, for the first time since Pataki was elected in
1994, there were no momentous issues hanging over the lawmakers'
heads, no budget crisis, no plan for deep cuts, no rent controls
ready to expire, no deadline for welfare reform. As legislators
noted repeatedly all year, there was nothing that, for either side,
HAD to be done.
In the final days of the session, there were a few notable
pieces of legislation passed, including one requiring that people
infected with HIV be reported to the state Health Department and
their sexual partners notified. Lawmakers also agreed on a program
of inspections and emissions-testing for heavy trucks and buses,
something long sought by environmentalists. And a deal was struck
on the management of the new Hudson River park in Manhattan that
places some limits on development along the river.
For the Assembly Democrats, especially Speaker Sheldon Silver,
the session went much as it did for Pataki. They, too, calculated
that there was not much they needed, politically. They, too,
entered the year with a limited agenda, and in defeat found
election-year ammunition.
Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April denied the Democrats much
of what they wanted, including a $500 million increase in spending
on school construction and a tripling of spending on child care.
Silver refused to negotiate with Pataki and Senate Majority Leader
Joseph Bruno on restoring some of the vetoed items, saying it was
all or nothing.
From the start, the speaker made it clear that he would rather
have the issue to use against Pataki than have a fraction of the
money back. And as the session ended, Silver kept up his attacks on
the governor with an eye toward the November election.
The Assembly Democrats called for steps to reduce New York's
auto insurance rates, knowing well that the Republicans would
reject them. Again, even before the session had ended, the defeat
had become a campaign issue, as the Democrats running against the
governor piggy-backed on the Assembly's plans and blamed Pataki for
high premiums.
It was telling that when asked what he considered the major
achievement of the session, Silver cited not a piece of
legislation, but a process: the negotiation of a budget through
public conference committees with the Senate, rather than in
private talks.
