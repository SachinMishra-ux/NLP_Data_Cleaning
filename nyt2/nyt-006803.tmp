On Wednesday the satellite entered a geosynchronous orbit,
22,300 miles above Earth. At that altitude, a satellite orbits
Earth at the same speed that the planet rotates. Thus it appears to
hover over a single spot in the sky, making it easy to communicate
with antennas on Earth.
The orbit is still slightly inclined to the Equator, however.
Hughes will be able to keep the satellite at a fixed longitude but,
when viewed from Earth, it will drift a few degrees north and south
of the Equator every day.
Because it is not perfectly stationary in the sky, the satellite
cannot be used for certain jobs, such as directly broadcasting
television signals to small home dishes. So Hughes will now face
another challenge: finding a customer or customers to lease or buy
the satellite. The original customer will not take it back.
Skidmore said Hughes had received many inquiries. He said many
satellite users, like ships and cable television companies, have
antennas that can track a satellite as it moves in the sky.
The satellite, which is now parked over the Pacific Ocean, has
enough fuel left to move to a designated longitude and to operate
for 10 to 15 years, Skidmore said. Hughes will split any proceeds
with the insurance companies that paid off the initial loss.
Renee Gentry, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aerospace
consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., said that although there is a
strong demand for new satellites, most big companies have their own
satellites ordered or in use.
Then look no further than the next blue-chip professional
services concern that wants to go public before the punch bowl gets
taken away.
Korn/Ferry International, the formidable head-hunting firm based
in Los Angeles, is expected to file for an initial public stock
offering sometime this year, a source close to the company says.
If the company follows through, the headhunter's IPO would flash
yet another signal that the suits on Wall Street are starting to
believe the stock market has reached its peak. And that means it's
time for Korn/Ferry's partners to cash in some of their equity.
They seem to be saying that the never-say-die bull-run of the '90s
finally may be losing steam (as if Monday's 207-point drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average wasn't portentous enough to remind
them).
Of course, Goldman Sachs' recent decision to go public is widely
viewed as an omen that all good things must (and probably will)
come to an end.
