Maybe a reserved treatment is surprising from NBC just coming
off the Michael Jordan Experience. It will have much more of a
chance to cover him live today with his second-round tee-time of 10
a.m. But if anything, extended coverage by NBC and ESPN Thursday
tended to rein in the hype and make the scores the thing to focus
on rather than the potential sideshow.
Meaning that even with non-Masters'-like TV time NBC does 16
hours over the four days, and ESPN takes the first two rounds to
near completion there won't be anything more on the Martin story
unless something materializes.
Martin, who has received nothing but praise by media types for
his accommodating demeanor, writes in the current issue of WE, a
magazine for people with disabilities:
With the network's NBA coverage complete for the year and
probably no Michael Jordan to baby-sit anymore, Dick Ebersol has
abdicated his title of NBC Sports president to Ken Schanzer.
Ebersol, who had the nameplate since 1989, is going to be known as
the chairman of NBC's Olympics division....
A seven-year contract extension between KCAL-Channel 9 and the
Lakers translates into about a $140 million revenue-sharing deal.
It also guarantees the station all Lakers playoff games that aren't
tied into the national NBC package....
The Kings' new three-year deal KRLA-AM (1110) doesn't mean
they'll be butting heads with the Ducks, whose games were on the
station last season. The Ducks' contract with KRLA ended, and
reportedly they're talking to XTRA-AM (690), which is the station
that the Kings left because of the signal's lack of penetration in
the San Fernando Valley and because the station presented many more
conflicts with other teams' broadcasts....
UCLA's football game at Miami on Sept. 26 will be on CBS'
schedule with a 9 a.m. kickoff time locally, and Terry Donahue will
be the analyst.
-- Maybe it's best that USC's new football play-by-play man
doesn't use his real name. With analyst Paul McDonald next to him
and Paul Hackett on the field, it would get pretty confusing.
SAN FRANCISCO Somewhere along the Olympic Club's Lake Course
Thursday, Steve Pate misplaced his swing. He stopped by the lost
and found after his first round at the U.S. Open and nobody had
turned it in.
So all the Agoura Hills resident could do was storm off to the
driving range, where he was a study in displaced anger, beating
range balls when everyone knew darn well that what he really wanted
to do was take a bulldozer to the 16th, 17th and 18th holes.
