bill, tobacco companies faced 800 lawsuits that have been filed

scheduled to begin soon. More are likely. By Barry Meier.
RICHARDSON-PROFILE In choosing Bill Richardson to be his new
energy secretary, President Clinton has given him an assignment
which traditionally carries little glamour and less opportunity for
a high public profile. But no one in the capital expects Richardson
to recede into relative obscurity. By Neil A. Lewis.

The Sonics trailed the Los Angeles Lakers at halftime in Game 4
of the Western Conference semifinals. Even more frustrating, they
were getting walloped in the series on their way to playoff
elimination.
So Payton exploded in the locker room and in the face of
former coach George Karl, who barked back. The scene reflected the
type of confrontations (usually over game-plan disagreements) that
Karl and Payton engaged in several times last season, seemingly
many times during their relationship.
The Sonics went on to lose that game 112-100. Payton followed
the tirade with an explosion on the court 31 points, 13 assists
and eight rebounds in 41 minutes yet his monster game did not
translate into a victory. One loss later, Karl was finished as
Sonics coach.
If Paul Westphal did not know already, he has a clue now.
Westphal, who was named the Sonics' new coach Wednesday, must get
more out of Payton in subtle ways than his predecessor did.
