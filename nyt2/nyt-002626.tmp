As the Senate considers comprehensive tobacco legislation at the
federal level, attention has focused on the big donations from the
five major tobacco companies and a few other tobacco industry
supporters to the Republican National Committee and various
Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
But scant attention has been paid to the industry's donations at
the state level, in part because these contributions are much
harder to track. The state parties have varying disclosure
requirements. Contributions to federal candidates are disclosed
several times a year to the Federal Election Commission.
The $1.8 million in tobacco contributions to the state parties
is important in light of legislation being debated in the House of
Representatives to ban corporate and labor union contributions to
the national parties. If such legislation is enacted, other
industries could follow the tobacco manufacturers' lead and begin
contributing much larger amounts to state parties. Many states
allow unlimited contributions to a state party.
The Campaign Study Group analyzed the election records of the
state party central committees in every state. In addition to the
donations from tobacco interests to the state Democratic and
Republican Parties, the study found an additional $1.7 million in
contributions since 1995 to state candidates and other committees
in four states that make complete campaign finance data for
candidates and other state parties readily available.
Given the less specific disclosure rules in the other states, it
is almost impossible to determine the total contributions to
individual state candidates, but campaign finance analysts believe
that cigarette makers, as well as other industries, are giving huge
amounts.
According to the analysis of the tobacco industry's state-level
political contributions, one cigarette maker, the Philip Morris
Cos., accounted for 62 percent of the $1.8 million given by tobacco
interests to the state parties. And 70 percent of the $1.8 million
went to Republicans.
The big tobacco companies have donated more money at the federal
level, contributing nearly $4 million to the Republican National
Committee and $325,000 to the Democratic National Committee since
1995. The state party contributions are significant because they
came at a time when the tobacco industry was trying to slow a legal
juggernaut that began when the Democratic attorney general of
Mississippi filed a lawsuit in 1994 to recover smoking-related
Medicaid costs from the big tobacco companies.
Subsequently, some 40 other states sued the cigarette makers.
These lawsuits led to last year's historic $368.5 billion
settlement between a group of state attorneys general and the
tobacco industry. But the settlement is subject to approval by the
Congress. Comprehensive tobacco legislation introduced in the
Senate has faced stiff opposition and prospects in the House are
also cloudy.
Of the 26 states in which the tobacco industry donated funds to
state party central committees, nearly half went to Florida. The
next largest donations went to New York, where the Republican state
committee received $254,100 and the Democrats received $5,000 , and
Washington State where the Republicans got $121,000 and the
Democrats received nothing.
In the 11 states receiving the b ulk of the tobacco
donations, Republican committeesreceived more than the Democrats in
all but two. In Missouri, the Democratic committee received $96,500
and the Republicans received $41,000. In Nebraska, the Democrats
got $20,000 white the Republicans received nothing. In the 15 other
states, the parties received less than $10,000 each. The tobacco
companies say their state-level contributions were not intended to
blunt lawsuits but to support local, pro-business candidates and
legislation.
