Now he's back, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day and Sonny and
Cher are singing I Got You Babe in the background. But this time
there's a twist.
While Lehman will be playing in the final twosome, this time he
and Bob Tway are leading the hunt behind Payne Stewart's four-shot
lead.
When you're the leader, all eyes are on you. When you're the
leader at the U.S. Open and everybody is saying that all you have
to do to win the thing is hit the fairways and play solid golf,
those fairways start to look about as wide as a ruler and the only
thing solid is the weight on your back.
But for a warm, pleasant, surprising Saturday afternoon in the
Bay Area, when the only problem was a devilish breeze that made the
sloping fairways even harder to hold, Lehman pulled himself back
together after a second-round 75 with a 2-under-par 68 that was the
best score of the day. He used good middle irons to set himself up
for three birdies on the first three holes and then bogeyed the
next three. He chipped in from 15 feet on No. 14 for a birdie and
then hit a wedge to within six feet and birdied No. 18.
Though with a slightly different perspective as the chaser, this
brings him to this familiar position on the last day, trying to
shake off a reputation as a guy who can't handle the big-time
pressure. Which is certainly an odd tag for a player with four PGA
Tour victories and who won the British Open in 1996.
So the question is whether it's fun or torture being in
contention on the last day of the U.S. Open.
SAN FRANCISCO For all the reasons Payne Stewart is not only
leading the 98th US Open but also is the only golfer under par,
this may be the most telling: There have been 294 double bogeys
through three rounds, but none by Stewart.
Swirling winds and bright sun that firmed the fairways so that
the slightest miss caused shots to roll off them and into the
ever-deepening rough have humbled all who have teed it up at The
Olympic Club; all, that is, except Stewart.
So Stewart is the improbable leader, firing a par 70 Saturday
that kept him in the same position at day's end as at day's
beginning 3 under par. Virtually all other golfers lost ground to
Stewart as he has a four-stroke lead over Tom Lehman (68 211) and
Bob Tway (73). His four-shot lead is the largest entering the final
round of the Open since Tony Jacklin also led by four in 1970.
Improbable leader? Well, Stewart may have won the Open in 1991
at Hazeltine outside Minneapolis, but he has won only one other
tourney in the US in the eight years since (the 1995 Shell Houston
Open, beating Scott Hoch in a playoff). Stewart may have won
$8,465,062 in his career and may be the seventh-leading all-time
money winner, but tour wins have been scant, and few since he beat
Scott Simpson in a playoff to take his second major. He won the
1989 PGA Championship.
