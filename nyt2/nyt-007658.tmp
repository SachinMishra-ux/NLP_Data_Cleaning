Batten won her race for the fifth consecutive year, Connie
Price-Smith won the women's shot-put for the seventh straight year
(61 feet 3 inches) and Charles Austin won the men's high jump for
the fourth straight year (7-6{).
The heat slowed the distance runners throughout the meet.
Sunday, Pascal Dobert won the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase in
8:33.91, the slowest winning time since 1979. But for athletes like
Dobert, trying to move up to the big time, winning was enough.
While many young athletes made their marks over the three days,
some older ones did all right, too. Take the men's 800-meter final,
which Mark Everett had won six times in the 10 previous years and
Johnny Gray six times in the 13 previous years. This time, the
29-year-old Everett beat his 38-year-old rival by 4 feet in
1:45.28. Gray's perpetual smile remained.
Al Campanis, the Los Angeles Dodgers executive who touched off a
furor and shattered his career by suggesting that blacks were
unqualified for high-level baseball jobs, died at home Sunday of
coronary artery disease. He was 81.
Campanis could look back on 44 years in the Dodgers'
organization. A native of Greece brought to New York City as a
youngster by his mother, he graduated from New York University,
served in the Navy and then embarked on a long and successful
tenure in baseball.
After a brief infield stint with Brooklyn in 1943, he had played
shortstop for the Montreal Royals in 1946 when Robinson broke into
organized baseball as the Dodgers farm team's second baseman.
Campanis once recalled how he had thrown his glove down and
challenged a base runner to do battle after the player tried to
rough up Robinson.
Later, Campanis managed in the Dodgers' farm system, served as
scouting director, followed the team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles
and, beginning in 1968, had been vice president of player
personnel. He brought Sandy Koufax and Fernando Valenzuela to the
Dodgers and oversaw decisions that shaped one of baseball's most
successful teams.
Even then, nearly four decades later, Campanis turned to
Rickey's thoughts for guidance, having transcribed those recordings
to cassette tapes he kept in battered blue and white shoe boxes.
When he interviewed Campanis, Koppel put nostalgia aside. He
asked him why baseball had no black managers, general managers or
owners and suggested that the answer was prejudice.
