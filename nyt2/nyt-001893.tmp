BOSTON There may have still been a few holdouts despite what
they saw on television last weekend in New York, but no more.
The Bret Saberhagen bandwagon is back at capacity after the Red
Sox righthander, in his longest start since 1995, went seven
innings in a 9-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles before 33,104 fans
Thursday night in Fenway Park.
The sellout crowd included Cardinal Bernard Law, who is said to
have a passing acquaintance with miracles, and Saberhagen's former
New York teammate John Franco and a couple of his playmates,
including newcomer Mike Piazza, who will be in uniform for the Mets
in their first visit to Fenway Park since 1986.
FYI: The Steamer, Bob Stanley, has not been invited back to
throw out Friday night's ceremonial first pitch. The Sox did not
want to renew the debate on whether it would be a wild pitch or
passed ball.
For most ballplayers, the ballpark is the last place they'd want
to spend an off day. Saberhagen figures Franco stuck around for no
more than five innings, which in the past would have assured the
Mets closer of missing at most an inning of his friend's
performance.
But not Thursday night, as Saberhagen went seven innings for the
first time in 23 starts dating back to Aug. 13, 1995. Aided by two
double plays and throwing his curveball with a frequency that
surprised the Orioles, Saberhagen clearly ended the tailspin that
raised questions about the staples, paste, and paper clips holding
his surgically repaired shoulder together.
Though the Orioles had runners in each of his innings,
Saberhagen did not allow a run until B.J. Surhoff hit a hanging
curveball over the Red Sox bullpen for a home run with one out in
the seventh. Saberhagen's best inning was the sixth, when the
Orioles had runners on the corners with no outs and he struck out
Joe Carter and retired the next two batters, Harold Baines and
Rafael Palmeiro, on easy fly balls.
Saberhagen's most efficient inning was the fourth, when he gave
up a leadoff single to Carter on his first pitch and needed only
two more pitches to retire the side. Baines hit a comebacker that
Saberhagen turned into a double play, and Palmeiro flied to left.
The Red Sox had been shut out the night before by Doug Johns, an
itinerant pitcher who began the previous spring touring cheese
factories while playing in Parma, Italy.
But Thursday night against a 22-year-old righthander from Aruba,
Sidney Ponson, the Red Sox finally took advantage of an Orioles
pitching staff that has three starters occupying the disabled list.
