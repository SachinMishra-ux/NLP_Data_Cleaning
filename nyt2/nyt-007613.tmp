It is the extras in life along with a few striking essentials,
like home prices and rents that are becoming noticeably more
expensive, and that rise is raising eyebrows. The University of
Michigan's weekly consumer surveys may be registering the smallest
percentage of Americans in 30 years worried about inflation, but
they are also registering a growing annoyance.
Just how can the overall inflation rate remain so low while so
many individual prices seem to be rising smartly? The answer lies
in the way the Consumer Price Index is calculated. The government
checks 80,000 different prices each month, many of them for
manufactured goods and commodities toys and cars, for example,
and gasoline and food. These prices figure heavily in the averaging
process that produces the Consumer Price Index. But over the last
year, the prices of manufactured goods and commodities have
remained steady, in part because of the pressure of global
competition, and that has held down the overall index.
The price increases these days are centered in the service
sector, where prices are rising rather smartly for a growing number
of items. These increases, however, are not widespread enough to
pull up the overall index beyond its current low level.
The expanding list of rising prices is partly a reflection of
the robust economy. As incomes rise and unemployment falls, people
become more ambitious in their purchases and more tolerant of price
increases, even while complaining. So they go along with a New York
merchant, for example, who has raised the price of his custom-made
suits by $100, to between $750 and $1,095.
Merchants in general have become bolder in pushing up prices.
That is particularly the case if what they sell is much in demand
these days and short in supply, like custom-made men's suits or
rental apartments. Or they are services available from no one else Walt Disney's theme parks, for example, and the state-run ferry
system that carries 25 million riders a year between Seattle and
the numerous island communities in Puget Sound.
Disney's admission price to its theme parks in Orlando, Fla.,
rose nearly 5 percent in April, to $42, and the state-run ferry
system's tickets went up 7 percent, on average, in May. The new
fares range up to $30 on the longest route. The state ferry
commission said the increases were required to finance expansion of
the fleet; the service is heavily used by tourists and commuters.
The commuters expressed resignation. Many said, in a questionnaire,
that they had no reasonable alternative to the ferry.
Prices in the last year have gone up significantly more than the
inflation rate in more than 30 categories. This is evident in the
data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and in more than
two dozen interviews with company executives and representatives of
trade and consumer organizations.
The list includes price increases already much in the news: fees
for using automated-teller machines, for example, car rentals,
airline fares for last-minute travelers, hotel rates, monthly
apartment rentals and housing prices, although the cost of running
a house has gone down for those who have refinanced mortgages.
Other increases run the gamut of services: legal fees, dental
care, HMO insurance premiums, parking-lot rates, some fast-food
restaurant prices, long-distance phone calls made within a state,
accountants' fees, school tuition at all levels and charges for
vehicle maintenance.
Entertainment is also more expensive cable television rates
are up, as are tickets to most theme parks and sports events,
entrance fees for some national parks and even wine. The price of a
funeral also keeps going up.
