But a Marketspan spokesman, Joseph McDonnell, said that
Catacosinos still has the confidence of other investors
representing far more shares than the coalition does.
McCall's move opens a new front in the battle over the $67
million in special compensation that Catacosinos and 25 other top
executives of Long Island Lighting Co. took before it disbanded in
a complex deal on May 28. The state's Long Island Power Authority
took over LILCO's electricity service. The rest of LILCO merged
with the Brooklyn Union Gas holding company to form Marketspan,
which the authority hired to run the electric system.
TRENTON, N.J. Faced with growing opposition from lawmakers
over her plan to raise the gasoline tax to pay for preserving 1
million acres of farmland and undeveloped land over the next 10
years, Gov. Christie Whitman said Thursday that she was considering
other ways to finance the program.
Whitman said that she was not abandoning her gasoline-tax
proposal, but she acknowledged that her aides were discussing
financing alternatives with legislative staff members.
Whitman aides said that one plan under discussion would involve
the state's borrowing $1 billion over the next 20 years to buy the
land during the next decade. The cost would be about $92 million a
year, to be paid from existing state revenue. In addition, the
state would spend another $445 million over 10 years to acquire
open space.
The gasoline tax now stands at 14.5 cents per gallon. Whitman
has been seeking legislative approval to put a 7-cent-a-gallon
increase on the ballot this November. She has proposed using 5
cents of the increase for transportation projects and 2 cents to
buy open space.
Her aides are continuing to push for the tax increase for
transportation projects. While state lawmakers have expressed
support for raising the tax for that purpose, there has been little
enthusiasm among Republicans or Democrats for raising the tax to
pay for open space preservation.
Whitman is likely to win more support for her borrowing proposal
than for the tax increase to meet her goal of preserving half of
the state's remaining two million acres of open space. In the
Republican-controlled Senate, lawmakers have been pushing
legislation that would put a $210 million bond proposal before
voters in November for open space preservation.
Whitman, who has been promoting the gas-tax proposal at frequent
appearances around the state, took her campaign Thursday to a farm
in Lawrence Township that was made part of the state's farmland
preservation program. She talked about the importance of farmland
preservation, but did not bring up her gas-tax plan until asked by
reporters.
