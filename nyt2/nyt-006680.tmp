Montgomerie, 34, has been the favorite of the media to win here,
perhaps because he sounded eerily like Mark O'Meara did on the eve
of his first majors victory, the 1998 Masters.
But he was crying behind the 18th green last year after Ernie
Els made par to beat him by a stroke. Just a hole earlier,
Montgomerie stood over a 5-foot birdie putt that would have tied
him for the lead. He stood and stood, waiting for the rowdy
Americans at Congressional Country Club in Maryland to hush. And
then he missed the putt.
Montgomerie's recent successes include finishing in the top 10
in three of his five PGA Tour events this year and all five of his
European Tour events, which helps explain his confidence in his
game and his chances here.
Lehman, 38, has been having a different kind of year. He's
finished in the top 10 in only three of his 14 events and won none,
but was buoyed (also soaked) by a third-place finish at wet
Westchester last weekend.
Lehman, like Montgomerie, trailed Els by a shot at the 17th tee
last year. But he followed a perfect drive by splashing a 7-iron
into a water hazard, and wound up finishing third.
BEIJING The Chinese government has formally spelled out its
radical new housing policy, under which the hallowed right of
workers to virtually cost-free apartments will be ended this year.
Under the new guidelines, detailed this week in the state-run news
media, most of China's urban residents will be required either to
buy their homes or pay much higher rents.
The wholesale change in housing is widely seen as potentially
one of the most far-reaching of China's economic reforms, one that
can spur entire new service industries, like home repair and
decoration and mortgage banking, as well as create a growing class
of independent homeowners.
The subsidy of housing and other social welfare benefits has
been a crushing burden on companies here, Huang said, and must be
ended if Chinese enterprises are to compete globally.
A freer housing market will also promote the development of
private enterprise and labor mobility, he said.
The new housing policy will be highlighted during President
Clinton's visit to China, which starts next week, with a visit to
homeowners.
