Still, the region is replete with double-dealing and surprising
alliances, and administration officials acknowledge that the
Kurdish leader benefiting from the smuggling betrayed the United
States less than two years ago.
The operation involves thousands of trucks transporting millions
of tons of oil, diesel fuel and other refined products annually,
openly traversing roads that U.S. and allied warplanes fly over in
northern Iraq, officials acknowledge.
The smuggling conduit into Turkey is enriching Saddam's
government and family, these officials say, at a time when he is
chafing under U.N. restrictions on official oil exports, which have
been in place since the end of the Persian Gulf War eight years
ago.
Until the United Nations determines that the Iraqi government
has eliminated programs to develop weapons of mass destruction, it
has prohibited Iraq from exporting oil except through a limited
program to raise humanitarian relief money.
But the Clinton administration has decided not to try to stop
the smuggling even though the United States is trying to hold
together a coalition in support of economic sanctions against Iraq.
The smuggling, which has been going on for years, has become so
lucrative that Turkish truckers have welded external fuel-storage
tanks onto their trucks to cash in on the business.
Much larger tanker trucks are also involved, according to
Turkish and Kurdish officials. At times, the trucks involved in the
smuggling have been so numerous that they have clogged traffic. The
smuggling operation is primarily funneled across the Turkish border
at the Khabour Bridge near the southeastern Turkish town of Silopi,
according to U.S., Turkish and Kurdish officials.
One energy expert in the Turkish government who spoke on the
condition of anonymity estimated that Iraqi smuggling now accounts
for about 25 percent of the Turkish fuel market, making it a
significant concern to international oil companies trying to
compete in Turkey.
Turkish government officials, meanwhile, have been meeting to
discuss ways to control the smuggling, in conjunction with their
efforts to deregulate the country's fuel markets, Turkish officials
said.
Officially, the U.N. prohibits all Iraqi oil exports except
those that generate money for humanitarian aid in Iraq as well as
for Gulf war victims. In May, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
approved Iraq's plan for distributing food and medicine purchased
under this program, paving the way for Iraq to increase the amount
of oil that Iraq could export under the plan from $2 billion to
$5.2 billion worth of oil over the next six months.
