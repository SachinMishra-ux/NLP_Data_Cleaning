The spread of sex-change chemicals in the environment could soon
be tracked with a test that uses tadpoles and liver cells of frogs.
The test, developed in Germany, takes only two days to work.
The sex-changing chemicals, which mimic female hormones such as
estrogen, are present in many pesticides and plastics. They are
causing increasing concern because they have been implicated in
breast cancer and declining sperm counts, and may also interfere
with fetal development.
The new test, developed by Werner Kloas and his colleagues at
Karlsruhe University, involves exposing cultures of liver cells
from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis to the chemical in
question.
The solution is then checked for vitellogenin-mRNA, the first in
a series of compounds produced after an estrogen receptor in a
liver cell has been activated. To make this possible, the
researchers first use the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which
can make millions of copies of a single piece of DNA or RNA.
But Kloas warns that it is often difficult to tell to what
extent chemicals that mimic estrogen will disrupt sexual
development.
So his test involves a further stage in which xenopus tadpoles
are immersed in the chemical to see how it affects their sexual
development. If an unusually high proportion of the tadpoles
develop female characteristics, this indicates a strong estrogenic
effect.
Some researchers have suggested that estrogen-type chemicals
have reduced the proportion of male amphibians in the wild, and
that this is one reason why amphibian populations around the world
have declined. 
The small suction device draws off the fluid which often
contains toxins and bacteria generated by an inflammatory trauma
response within the wound. It is this fluid which blocks key blood
vessels and leads to necrosis the death of surrounding tissue.
Until now, repairing necrotic skin would have meant expensive
plastic surgery and a long stay in the hospital.
But hopes have been raised in Australia after doctors
successfully treated a 42-year-old woman for a wound caused by a
tiger snake's bite.
With a vacuum technique normally used for treating wounds caused
by accidents or gunshots, Ian Holten, a plastic surgeon from the
Geelong Hospital near Melbourne, extracted half a liter of fluid
from the victim's wound in 24 hours. As a result, blood was able to
flow normally again, promoting the growth of healthy tissue.
