From there, the bullpen and stellar defensive plays by Biggio,
Spiers and Derek Bell were all the Astros needed to move to 18
games over .500 (46-28).
They are both students from Congo who fled to the United States,
certain they would have been killed in the political turmoil at
home. Bakam Mimpongo, 21, was caught at New York's Kennedy
International Airport, trying to enter with fake papers. Bisinwa
Borumbi, 22, stowed away in a cargo ship and was seized in
Jacksonville, Fla.
Each gave similar accounts of persecution, of paramilitary
groups and rebels ravaging villages and taking prisoners, of their
desperate need for asylum.
But in the United States, their paths have sharply diverged. Ms.
Mimpongo spent five months and 10 days in a federal detention
center in New York City last year before being granted asylum.
Borumbi, detained in Miami in February of this year, was freed on
parole after three weeks, but his case has not yet been resolved.
Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees point to the
different treatment of cases like these as a sign that federal
immigration laws are applied unevenly throughout the nation.
Important decisions from how long it takes to review an asylum
seeker's case to whether he or she is quickly paroled or detained
for months seem to hinge more on the number of beds available at
a detention center than on a cohesive national policy.
The inconsistencies in granting parole are dizzying, said
Charles Wheeler, who monitors the cases of asylum seekers
nationwide as the supervisor of the detention project at the
Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a private advocacy group in San
Francisco.
In El Paso, Texas, he said, many asylum seekers have to post
bond before being paroled. In Los Angeles and New Jersey, asylum
seekers are usually released, but only if family members will
sponsor them. In Miami, virtually everyone is released. In New
York, virtually no one is.
A recently released study and interviews with more than a dozen
lawyers and their clients confirm Wheeler's findings. While some
asylum seekers are allowed to argue their cases shortly after
arrival, others languish in detention for months, sometimes
surrounded by convicted criminals in county jails. Some are
released after posting bond as low as $5,000, or simply by
providing the address where they plan to reside.
While some women with children are released immediately, others
are held for months, separated from their children. Lawyers said
that clients with identical cases might be treated differently from
one month to the next.
Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees say that these
irregularities are an especially urgent issue now because the
swiftness of deportations under the new law makes the need for a
good, timely defense more critical than ever.
