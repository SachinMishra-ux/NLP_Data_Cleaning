The decision was reached after an unprecedented national policy
review that had a team of physicians, ethicists and pharmacists
delving into such issues as the medical necessity for erections and
the dangers of recreational use of pills like Viagra.
A stunning 2 million prescriptions have been written for Pfizer
Inc.'s Viagra since it was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in April making Viagra the most successful new
pharmaceutical on record.
It's become a staple of late-night talk-show banter, so easy to
purchase that one can order it over the Internet. But it's
expensive selling wholesale for $7 a pill, retail for about $9 or
$10.
In the last analysis, though, economic factors, as opposed to
medical issues, decided the question for Kaiser. Even if users were
limited to 10 pills a month, the HMO estimated that the cost would
exceed $100 million a year.
By comparison, Kaiser dispensed only $59 million worth of
anti-virals last year, a category that includes all the protease
inhibitors and other expensive drugs used to fight AIDS.
Kaiser's decision overrules some regional decisionmakers who had
hoped the HMO would provide at least limited coverage to help
certain patients.
Several other HMOs have adopted rules limiting Viagra coverage
to six pills or so each month. About half of state-run Medicaid
programs provide Viagra benefits. Standard Medicare coverage
doesn't include any self-administered drugs, although some HMO
plans have been extending Viagra benefits that generally match
what's being offered through commercial plans.
Viagra is the only FDA-approved pill affected by the new Kaiser
policy. But at least two other potential impotence treatments,
considered to be a year or two away from the FDA-approval stage,
also will be excluded, along with the so-called Muse suppository,
Kaiser officials said.
The policy will take full effect when standard HMO contracts
come up for renewal, generally the first of the year. Employers and
other health-plan purchasers would have to buy an optional
supplemental benefit plan if they want Kaiser to provide the
coverage anyway.
Kaiser doctors may continue to write prescriptions for Viagra,
and the drug will be available in the HMO's pharmacies. But the
standard $5 co-payment will not cover the cost.
