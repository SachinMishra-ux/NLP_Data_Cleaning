For starters, she's a klutz. She hates makeup, speaks out of
turn, blows her first meeting with a husky matchmaker (she sets her
rump on fire) and is prone to wildly funny slapstick pratfalls.
Mulan, renamed Ping, pals around with army buddies Yao (Harvey
Fierstein) and Ling (Gedde Watanabe) and helps pursue the advancing
Huns. Along the way there are glorious vistas (inspired by David
Lean) and breathtaking windows into ancient Chinese culture: a
scene in which Hun soldiers ring the lip of a snowy crest is
arresting and unforgettable.
Yet it's a weird gumbo, this mix of adult subject matter,
radiant artistry, saccharine tunes and a buoyant, child-friendly
jokiness. It doesn't quite gel as though Disney yearned to be a
grown-up film but couldn't bear to abandon its family-movie
formula or the Happy Meal revenues it promises.
How cute, I thought to myself. Nothing like hot, summer days and
enterprising little kids. It's a milestone of almost every child's
life.
I pulled up closer to the stand and, sure enough, there was my
son and his friend, manfully minding shop over the card table that
held his mom's best Tupperware pitcher and an ice chest.
It was a good day's work. With the heat index at 108 degrees,
the two budding businessmen had a sure thing.
I wonder, why is $2.75 earned by standing in the suffocating
heat such a bonanza compared to the $5 a week we hand him for doing
his chores? He hardly takes note of those earnings, even though he
arguably has to work harder for them. No, the thrill comes from
planning, making and selling the product himself.
It's no different for adults. This sense of ownership be it a
program at church, a product on the shelf or a marketing plan translates into the difference between participating in something
and caring deeply about it.
It reminds me of the old joke about the ham-and-egg breakfast.
In producing it, the joke goes, the chicken is involved, but the
pig is committed.
I'm not sure we want our commitment to go that far, but it does
make a point. For most of us to achieve any level of sacrificial
commitment, we must feel our input is valuable and essential.
