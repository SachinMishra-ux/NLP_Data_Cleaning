After Bill MacKenzie, a friend of Holman's who scouts for the
Colorado Rockies, complained about how many broken bats he had seen
in spring training in 1996, Holman took it as a challenge. He
searched for stronger wood and wound up with maple, which is so
sturdy that it is used to build airplane propellers. The first
maple bat was made out of a piece of railing from Holman's home and
was given to an 11-year-old named Adam Healy. The boy slept with it
and homered in his next game.
Holman purchased a rare Italian lathe that was being used to
make ax handles, turned his garage into a workshop and began
testing and marketing Sam Bats.
Bill Murray, baseball's director of operations, said it does not
approve new bat makers once a season starts because umpires are
given a list of sanctioned equipment companies and it would be
chaotic to continually add names. Consequently, it took more than a
year for Sam Bats to receive approval.
But making a profit is not. Holman, who answers his own
telephone and eats lunch while his pregnant cat, Marbles, meows in
the former garage, is essentially a one-man company. Hillerich Bradsby dwarfs the competition by producing almost a million bats
per year, which are sold to pro players at $30.50 a bat. Teams buy
the bats, and players who have contracts with HB receive a nominal
fee. Holman has made about 450 bats this year at a cost of $43
each, up from 400 last year, but he is $40,000 in debt after
investing $100,000.
That presents another thorny problem. Because Holman makes every
bat by hand, cutting the wood, shaping it and sanding it, no two
bats are exactly alike. He tries to adhere to the specific
measurements ordered by each player and was working on Canseco's on
a recent weekend, but he cannot duplicate each bat, and that has
irritated some players.
Holman hopes to survive, then thrive, and he studies games
mostly to see who is using Sam Bats. He would love to persuade
Little League, high school and college teams to switch from
aluminum to maple.
WASHINGTON Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, has
appointed as a senior military adviser a retired army general who
was ordered by a U.S. court to pay millions of dollars in damages
for his involvement in a 1991 massacre in which 270 people were
estimated to have been killed.
The appointment of the retired officer, Lt. Gen. Sintong
Panjaitan, could result in early strains in the relationship
between the United States and Habibie, who came to office last
month with promises of an improvement in Indonesia's human rights
record and in its ties with Washington.
Panjaitan oversaw troops who carried out the November 1991
massacre in East Timor, the former Portuguese colony that was
invaded by Indonesia in the 1970s and annexed despite international
protests.
The soldiers opened fire on demonstrators who had gathered at a
graveyard for the funeral of a young East Timorese man who had been
killed by soldiers two weeks earlier.
