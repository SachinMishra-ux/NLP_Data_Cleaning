For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
