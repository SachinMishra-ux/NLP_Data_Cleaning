Despite an unprecedented wave of mega-mergers, there are still
more than 9,000 U.S. commercial banks and the number of branches
actually climbed from 41,881 in 1984 to 59,091 last year.
In 1985, McKinsey consultant Asheet Mehta said it cost banks
$11.60 per month to serve the average retail customer for 6.3
transactions, including 4.4 visits to the bank and 1.9 visits to an
ATM. In 1993, it cost $14.80 to serve the average customer for 10.8
transactions a month, including 3.3 at an ATM and 5.3 inside the
bank.
In 1995, U.S. commercial banks spent $20 billion on technology
and by the year 2000 the annual investment is expected to hit $25
billion. It is true that serving customers with new technology
helps lower transaction costs. For example, Mehta says it costs
banks an average of $2.50 if you talk to a teller versus 40 cents
if you use an ATM, 24 cents if you use a telephone voice response
unit and 10 cents if you bank by PC.
Some banks, including Wells Fargo, sell stamps for an 11 percent
markup as well as ski-lift and other tickets to help make ends
meet.
Banks stress that they are not public utilities, that no one is
forced to use their ATMs and they are entitled to charge for the
convenience they offer. Nevertheless, there has been an outcry
against surcharges and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.) has even called for a ban against them.
ISLAMORADA, Fla. Surrounded by a forest of West Indian
hardwood and exquisitely blue waterways, Juanita Greene's
efficiency cottage in Key Largo seemed an idyllic place in which to
pass her retirement years.
So less than two months ago, she moved to the greater Miami
area, to a neighborhood she describes as quiet and peaceful.
Now, new regulations governing the use of the personal
watercraft in the Keys, one of the United States' most popular
water-sports locations, seek to prevent other residents from
following Ms. Greene's example.
On June 10, the Monroe County Commission approved an ordinance
that prohibits operating the craft within 1,200 feet of 14 beaches
and resort spots from Key West to Key Largo. The personal
watercraft moored on such shores must idle out to the perimeter
area at speeds of about five miles an hour to avoid making waves
and noise.
But Karen Lee, an environmental advocate who pushed for curbs on
personal watercraft, said the measure covers only 2 percent of the
shoreline of the Keys. Although some of it is residential, other
parts are wildlife sanctuaries.
