Merrill's settlements with the county and a water district that
had invested in the county fund serve as a warning to Wall Street
that it may face penalties even if a customer voluntarily buys
something that was inappropriate.
Orange County had refused to calculate a market value of its
investments, and no one forced it to do so. Had the declining
market values been readily available, the risks would have become
clearer to the public much earlier. Better accounting might have
kept this debacle from happening.
It is an odd conjunction of opposing political cultures. Turkey,
the emblem of secular governance in the Middle East, and Iran, the
heartland of Islamic fundamentalism, are both resisting powerful
internal political movements by prosecuting the mayors of their
largest cities, Istanbul and Tehran.
Istanbul's mayor, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was recently convicted
of inciting hatred in a speech last year. Tehran's mayor,
Gholamhossein Karbaschi, just went on trial on corruption charges.
In truth, the two men are being pursued less for what they said or
did than for what they represent, which is a strong desire among
their countrymen for a more inclusive, less rigid brand of
politics.
In attacking the mayors, the rulers of Turkey and Iran have
shown a potentially fatal inability to practice moderation in
politics. The defenders of the faith in each nation will likely
discover someday that in their unyielding pursuit of conformity
they only strengthened and radicalized the popular causes they
feared and tried to suppress.
In both prosecutions, the legal battle itself is just a skirmish
in a broader struggle between ruling authority and a growing
political opposition. In both cases, the mayors represent an
opportunity for peaceful change that should not be lost.
The rulers of Turkey and Iran would acknowledge no common
thread. If anything, they would maintain that the two cases show
how different the countries are. The generals who wield real power
in Turkey are determined to snuff out any Islamic political
activity, fearful it will undermine their secular state and even
lead eventually to an Iranian-style revolution. The clerics who run
Iran are intolerant of civil authority and see it as a threat to
the Islamic code.
But when the ideological and legal veneer is removed, the two
cases are essentially about the same thing: extremism in the
defense of power.
I saw this tendency when I visited Turkey and Iran last fall. A
Turkish general who denounced his country's main Islamic political
party was just as intransigent as a cleric in Tehran who opposed
reform. Though the two nations view each other as political
antagonists, and their handling of religious matters could not be
more different, the Turkish generals and Iranian clerics are
allergic to genuine democracy. The generals are secular
fundamentalists, the clerics Islamic fundamentalists.
Erdogan's offense was not that he sowed discord, but that he was
a leader of the Welfare Party, the Islamic political organization
that drew the largest number of votes in parliamentary elections
three years ago. The party briefly governed Turkey in a coalition,
but was then displaced and ultimately outlawed at the behest of the
generals.
