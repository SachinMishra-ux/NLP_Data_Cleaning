Silver Charm, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness
last year, was unexpectedly booked into the Gold Cup on Friday
afternoon. He left Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., Sunday and
flew to Los Angeles to run against his two chief rivals for honors
among older horses. He is 4 years old, Skip Away is 5 and Gentlemen
is 6.
The Hollywood Gold Cup, at a mile and a quarter, would be the
first meeting of the three horses. But the handlers of all three
have expressed interest in running in the $1 million Pacific
Classic at Del Mar in August, the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont
Park in October and, ultimately, in the $4 million Breeders' Cup
Classic at Churchill Downs in November.
WIMBLEDON, England They have put down new outdoor carpeting on
the Center Court since Pete Sampras won the Wimbledon title last
year, an ambitious bit of redecorating not tried here for the past
30 years.
For Sampras and for Wimbledon, change is rarely a welcome
commodity. But since he will be getting a toehold on the usual
rugged blend of natural rye and fescue that he has trampled all
four times he has won this championship, the innovation should not
prove too unsettling for Sampras. He has more pressing problems to
deal with than the greenery.
Though Sampras is as tradition-minded as the keepers of this All
England Club, the underage grass figures to be the least of his
worries as he seeks to become the first man since Bjorn Borg to
capture five Wimbledon titles. He has a slump to shake off and a
drought in Grand Slam events to repair, not to mention a full cast
of characters intent on taking advantage of his fallibility through
the first half of 1998. Had Sampras performed up to snuff this year
at the Grand Slam events, he might already have tied Roy Emerson's
career record dozen championships by now; instead, he has come into
Wimbledon behind schedule.
Sampras said the potential threats include the brute servers
such as fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, who has a sprained ankle,
14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who received a 10-spot improvement
from Wimbledon's seeding committee in deference to his final-round
appearances in 1992 and 1994, and the 1996 champion Richard
Krajicek.
But Krajicek, like Australia's sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter, the
slump-ridden U.S. Open champion, has yet to prove that he is
capable of winning more than one Grand Slam event.
Besides the superlative servers, Sampras gave a nod in the
direction of stylish returners such as 13th-seeded Andre Agassi and
eighth-seeded Cedric Pioline; but both of them arrived with less
than intimidating grass-court preparation.
True to his maverick sensibilities, Agassi, who suffered a
demeaning opening-round loss to Russia's Marat Safin, an
18-year-old qualifier, at the French Open, was the only seeded man
to avoid all of the grass-court warm-up events. After all, he won
the 1992 title here after electing to do the same haphazard
preparation, much of it on the hardcourts that he claims hone his
timing.
As for Pioline, last year's surprise runner-up, his Wimbledon
preparation was made on a conspicuously sour note. He was ejected
at Nottingham for cursing at the chair umpire, Pedro Bravo, during
his match against Australia's Scott Draper, this year's Queen's
Club champion.
