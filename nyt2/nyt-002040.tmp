But Granger contends she has a realistic grasp on the moderate
leanings of the 12th Congressional District a district that
faithfully supported Pete Geren, a Democrat who on some issues
could out-conservative the Republicans.
Hall has some complicated footwork ahead of him if he thinks he
can bump the immensely popular Granger from the floor. His
supporters are obviously hoping to woo pro-choice Republicans away
from her dance card.
Granger's ready to dance with them what brung her, all right, as
long as they remember there are some steps she won't do.
They also connected with the network of other Gulf War veterans
who had become ill. In a study of 170 patients with Gulf War
illness, they found 76 with signs of mycoplasmal infections. They
published their findings in occupational medicine journals and
described it in testimony before Congress and investigative panels.
Wolf, who served with the Army Reserve's 920th transportation
unit in Saudi Arabia, tested positive for mycoplasma infection, as
did his 12-year-old daughter. He has undergone several cycles of
antibiotic treatment.
When a mysterious cluster of illnesses was reported by residents
of Huntsville, Texas, the Nicolsons charged that DOD researchers
had tested biologic agents containing mycoplasmas on Texas
prisoners experiments that also sickened guards and local
residents.
Nancy Nicolson was quoted in articles charging that U.S.
operatives had broken into their lab and had tried to kill them on
multiple occasions. They left Houston after Nicolson was stripped
of his chairmanship at M.D. Anderson, and set up their private
laboratory in California.
Today, with the government prepared to take a serious look at
their claims, the couple steers the conversation away from
conspiracy theories.
Now, they are satisfied by the cooperation they're getting from
the military, particularly since Army Gen. Hugh Shelton became
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Shelton, a Green Beret who
was an assistant division commander during the Gulf War, has been
supportive of their work, they say.
The Nicolsons say that 75 percent of Gulf War veterans who test
positive for mycoplasma infection recover on long-term antibiotic
treatment. They also recommend nutrition therapy and other methods
to boost the immune system.
