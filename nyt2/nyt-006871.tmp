But space is not the sole concern. Although licensed private
preschools, like the public schools, have state-certified
early-childhood teachers, there is a great variety in the
conditions and philosophy of each preschool.
On a tour the other day, Riccobono found one preschool, on the
ground floor of a housing project in the East New York section of
Brooklyn, practically devoid of books and instructional supplies
and floors that needed a thorough cleaning. Still, he chose the
preschool after concluding that the problems were easily fixable.
Around the state, 124 of about 700 school districts those with
the largest share of poor children are eligible in the first
year, and of those, 80 are participating. School districts will be
phased in based on their percentage of poor children, and by the
fourth year, all districts will be eligible.
Other districts are also facing problems implementing the
program. In small, growing cities like Gloversville, west of
Albany, school officials are having trouble finding enough school
buildings or licensed day-care centers to accommodate the rising
student enrollment, state education officials said. In East Aurora,
in western New York, school districts are negotiating with a
mammoth day-care center run by the toy company Fisher Price.
Several cities are looking for empty rooms in state buildings.
In New York City, the demand for the state-financed
prekindergarten classes is hard to gauge, though it is well known
that the day-care crunch is particularly intense for the city's
working poor: There are 36,000 children on a waiting list for
city-subsidized day-care slots.
MONTREAL Luis Lopez, who is normally an infielder, had no
problem at all with any of the fly balls hit his way Thursday night
in his first major league start in right field. Instead, it was a
ground ball that proved tricky for Lopez, and that played a key
role in helping the Montreal Expos beat the Mets, 7-6.
Lopez's misplay, as well as the inability of Rey Ordonez to
drive someone home with one out and at least one runner in scoring
position in the fifth and sixth innings, were what hurt the Mets
the most. Ordonez popped out to short with Edgardo Alfonzo on third
in the fifth and grounded to third and into a double play with the
bases loaded in the sixth.
The Mets, whose last four losses have each been by one run, did
score three times in the sixth off the Montreal rookie Javier
Vazquez to erase a 2-0 deficit. But Masato Yoshii (4-3), who had
allowed home runs to Vladimir Guerrero and Rondell White in the
first two innings, could not hold the lead.
In the Expos' sixth, Lopez let a bases-loaded single by Mark
Grudzielanek get under his glove for a two-base error, which led to
a five-run inning that made it 7-3 and pretty much doomed the Mets.
Lopez was playing right field because Bernard Gilkey is still
having problems with his left eye a week after being hit by a pitch
in the face and because Butch Huskey's aching right knee needed
some rest.
The loss left the Mets (38-29) with a 3-4 finish to their
eight-day journey to Florida and Montreal, two of the weakest teams
in the National League. Yoshii was charged with 7 runs on seven
hits in five and a third innings against the weakest-hitting lineup
in the NL, his worst outing as a major leaguer.
