So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families and businesses when fathers work?
For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything aside from providing a paycheck to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other. HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY 
Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
+ How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
Do businesses value a man for being a good dad and show it in
their policies?
