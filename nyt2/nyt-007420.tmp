The surgeons, who were seeking to resolve a 20-year debate about
which procedure is more effective, say there is little if any
noticeable difference in the two sides of the patients' faces. But
the study checked the patients once, one year after the procedures,
and other plastic surgeons say it may be years before it is known
whether the patients' faces will show any irregularities.
The crux of the ethical dispute is whether federal and state
rules concerning medical experiments on humans applied to this
study. Critics say that this was the case: that the surgeons should
have had the study approved in advance by their hospital's ethics
committee, referred to by doctors as an institutional review board,
or IRB. The critics also contend that the doctors should have given
patients consent forms explaining in detail the procedures and
risks they faced.
The study's authors say that they did not seek committee
approval or give detailed consent forms because neither was
necessary. Since the two procedures were well established, they
said, the study was not a human experiment. And so the patients
were asked to sign a general consent form given to all surgery
patients and were simply given an oral description of the study.
The doctors who carried out the study agreed to contact some
patients for interviews, but ultimately, only one patient, speaking
on condition of anonymity, talked to a reporter.
She is a woman in her 70s who said she was pleased with the face
lift she received from the doctors. Asked if she was aware that she
was the subject of a study, she said she was the type of person who
doesn't want to know much about what's going to happen.
The law suggests otherwise. Under both federal and New York
state law, a human experiment is defined simply as an investigation
that uses people's bodies and is not required for the direct
diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a patient's condition. It
does not matter whether the procedures being used are experimental
or not, according to federal health officials.
Robert Hinkley, a spokesman for the New York state Department of
Health, said the department was starting to look into the case.
From an initial reading of the study, he said, it appears that the
researchers should have gone to an institutional review committee
and gotten formal written consent from the patients. If the Health
Department determines that the doctors violated state law, they
could face unspecified sanctions.
The federal watchdog agency that monitors human experiments, the
Office of Protection from Research Risks at the Department of
Health and Human Services, was alerted to the study by an anonymous
letter from New York, which said:
The federal agency concluded that the study was indeed human
experimentation, but that since no federal funds were used to
conduct it, it had no jurisdiction to investigate further.
Aston said the study proved that the more limited face-lift
procedure could do just as well. Nevertheless, he still uses both
procedures in his own practice, depending on the patient.
