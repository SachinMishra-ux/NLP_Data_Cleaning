Meadows is executive director of The Presidio Trust, the
quasi-public group charged with converting the former Army base
into a facility for a variety of civilian uses.
Exactly who gets what already has become a controversy. But the
arguments so far have overlooked a hidden asset one that Meadows
thinks can fuel the Presidio's economic engine.
In the Internet age, having fiber in the ground is like a
building site being wired for electricity or plumbed for water and
sewage.
Meadows plans to make this fiber loop the nerve center of a web
of multimedia, video and Internet-based enterprises.One industry he
hopes to kick-start is the creation of distance-learning broadcast
centers for colleges.
He also intends to plug all 1,600 housing units on the Presidio
into this fiber net, so folks at home will be able to hold
video-conferences with their offices or with other Presidio
families.
This isn't just some bureaucratic dream. Before he came to the
Presidio, Meadows managed the conversion of Denver's Lowry Air
Force Base. There, he created a fiber town with 4,000 wired homes
and many multimedia enterprises.
Meadows expects to encounter envy and opposition from those not
lucky enough to land in this high-tech Garden of Eden.
That's the gist of a new survey conducted by the Institute for
the New California, a public policy group in Walnut Creek. The INC
reached this conclusion after polling a scientific sample of
adults.
The Institute defined wired workers as wage earners who worked
outside the home, used network-connected PCs on the job, and were
relatively free to organize their own workdays.
Pollster Mike Hais said the survey respondents who fit this
definition identified themselves as independents, Republicans and
Democrats, in that order.
