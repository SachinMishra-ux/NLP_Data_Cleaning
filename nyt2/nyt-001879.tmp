Just a year ago, Sirhan himself insisted to a parole board that
he did not shoot the senator but was framed. His request to be
released was denied.
Adding to the controversy, a Los Angeles jury awarded a
photographer $450,600 in 1996 on claims that his photos of the
senator's death were mysteriously destroyed.
Scott Enyart was 15 on the night of the assassination and
contends that he was standing on a pantry table taking photographs
before, during and after the tragedy.
Enyart sued the city, claiming police confiscated his valuable
negatives, then lost or destroyed them. After years of litigation,
state authorities notified him in January 1996 that his film had
been found, misfiled in state archives.
But a city courier lost those images, claiming someone stole
them from a rental car when he stopped to fix a flat tire.
Defense attorneys claimed Enyart was never in the pantry and
that he only shot one roll, capturing little more than crowd shots
-- not the image of Kennedy twisting and falling, as Enyart has
claimed.
Charach, who said he too was in the room when Kennedy was
killed, has made a career investigating Sirhan's claim that another
man fired the fatal shot.
In a request for a new evidentiary hearing and trial for Sirhan,
Lawrence Teeter filed a petition last year with the Court of
Appeal, and now it sits before the state Supreme Court.
The petition claims police and prosecutors ignored evidence that
an armed security guard with anti-Kennedy views may have fired the
fatal shot. Teeter claims Sirhan may have been hypnotized when he
fired his own gun.
Grier isn't on the conspiracy theory convention circuit.
Instead, the football-player-turned-reverend commemorated the
anniversary earlier this week by leading a prayer in front of the
Ambassador Hotel.
