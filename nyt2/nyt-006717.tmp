WASHINGTON The Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill suffered a
setback Thursday when the House voted to change the rules of debate
and allow consideration of 258 amendments during seven more weeks
of floor action.
Representative Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican and
co-sponsor of the bill, joined other Republican moderates in
agreeing to the new rule. He consented after House leaders pledged
to complete work on the legislation by the August recess, said
Shays spokesman Seth Amglott.
The 258 amendments to be considered for this single issue is
more than the total number of amendments approved for debate by the
House Rules Committee in the past 11/2 years, said lawmakers.
The strategy was at odds with the usual practice of limiting
debate and amendments since Republicans gained control of the House
in January 1995.
ARLINGTON, Texas Rangers pitching coach Dick Bosman teaches
pitchers to throw nothing but strikes. Hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo
emphasizes that hitters should swing at nothing but strikes.
Jaramillo, who watched as the Rangers accumulated the
second-most walks in the league through Tuesday, isn't the only one
who is mystified. Just exactly what constitutes the strike zone
remains a mystery in the major leagues. Manager Johnny Oates
fiercely debated that point yesterday with plate umpire Ted Barrett
and was ejected for arguing balls and strikes.
Individual umpires do have different strike zones. In the AL,
John Hirschbeck and Durwood Merrill have a reputation for large
strike zones, while Terry Craft and Al Clark are considered the
toughest on pitchers. One veteran umpire watcher said John Shulock
and Tim Tschida are the best at calling balls and strikes.
Hall of Famer Ted Williams used to study umpire tendencies. It
was his belief that taller umpires called more high strikes and
shorter umpires had a lower strike zone.
Another perception is that younger umpires have larger strike
zones, a reputation enhanced when rookie umpire Ed Bean was behind
the plate for Kenny Rogers' perfect game. However, it remains
difficult to get any pitch above the waist called a strike.
But any pitcher throwing above the waist without Wetteland's
fastball is asking for serious trouble, whether it's a ball or a
strike.
