Los Angeles cannot afford, for instance, to do what she said
Torrance does, which is to turn down federal funds for low-income
housing.
She also predicted it would also be hard to get voter approval
of expanding the City Council to 50 members.
Fleming said his proposal provides for part-time members of the
district boards and Metropolitan Council, who might at most receive
a $100-per-meeting stipend, except for the district mayors.
The first mayor of each district would be the City Council
member who represents the district in 2001, when the new charter
would take effect. They would be paid the same $107,390 a year they
now earn as City Council members and would retain their staffs.
Each five- to seven-member district board would meet once a
week. Each would send its mayor and a few board members to the
Metropolitan Council, which might meet three or four times a month.
The mayor of Los Angeles would remain the city's chief
administrator, with expanded power over policy, and hiring and
firing department heads.
Fleming said the new system of government should begin July 1,
2001, when the current mayor and half of the City Council will be
term-limited out of office. He plans to formally present the plan
to Riordan and both Charter Reform Commissions soon.
Riordan has proposed creation of a system of advisory
neighborhood councils, selected at local caucuses, with some power
over a portion of the city budget.
WASHINGTON A near-collision by two big passenger jets at La
Guardia Airport in New York in April has prompted the Federal
Aviation Administration to order retraining for the 10,000 air
traffic controllers working in airport towers nationwide.
A US Airways DC-9 arriving at La Guardia on April 3 flew under a
departing Air Canada A-320, the two planes missing each other by as
little as 20 feet, according to the FAA.
