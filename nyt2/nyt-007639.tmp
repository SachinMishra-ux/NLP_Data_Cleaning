Sykes sees VH1's growing success as confirmation of his theory
about how the generation of music fans who grew up in the 1960s and
'70s refused to relinquish their proprietary interest in music.
President Clinton fits the description of a baby boomer with a
continuing passion for music, Sykes said. He has several personal
letters from the president attesting to his interest in the
channel's programming. (The president was especially taken by a
series of specials VH1 did on the 20th anniversary of the death of
Elvis Presley, Sykes said.)
Even though their rotted shoes are falling off them and they are
living on dried corn and pumpkin leaves they carry 12 miles from
home, the black squatters on Daskop Farm are being extraordinarily
careful of the white owner's property. They want the farm they
say it is their ancestral land, and can even point out a stone they
say their great-great-grandmothers ground corn on. But right now
they are not willing even to walk across one of his fallow fields.
In the endless war over land that began when whites seized the
country 120 years ago and led to government promises in recent
years to redistribute the land to poor farmers, a new front opened
this week. Hundreds of subsistence farmers from 20 villages in the
Svosve communal area left the stony hills their families had been
pushed into and moved onto three farms in the Marondera area.
An international outcry ensued, the currency plummeted and
farmers asserted that Cabinet ministers were plotting to steal
their best farms for retirement villas.
Since then, things have calmed down. The government, farmers and
international donors are talking. About 200 farms available for
sale were found, said David Hasluck, executive director of the
largely white Commercial Farmers Union, and about $800 million in
grants and loans from donors and banks has been offered on the
conditions that the land is paid for, that it goes to poor people
and that they are settled, not just dumped.
For the people of Svosve, time ran out. They said they picked
Daskop, Homepark and Igava farms from the government's list, and
are asking for parts that are not being used.
Daskop is an obviously well-run farm with a big irrigation pond,
a husking plant, fields of seed corn growing under plastic tents
and cattle fattening on watered grass. The squatters are living on
a distant corner, keeping to themselves. There has been no trouble,
said Shaun David, the farm manager, and he's been told by the owner
to leave the squatters alone.
The owners said they would use the sale proceeds to build new
housing and schools on their remaining farms, he said.
(On Sunday night, state television reported that the minister of
land thought he had convinced the squatters to go home until the
government can resettle them at its own pace.)
