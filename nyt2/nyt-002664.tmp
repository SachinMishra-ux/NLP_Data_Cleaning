Normally, a race by a political newcomer against a 63-year-old,
eight-term incumbent would not generate much attention. But Ford,
who was educated at Harvard University and Harvard Law School, has
so far raised nearly $100,000 only slightly less than the
$120,000 raised by Towns. Furthermore, Ford is being encouraged by
Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., the chairman of the Brooklyn
Democratic Party, and the Ford campaign is expected to benefit from
whatever assistance the chairman can muster.
For nearly two years, Towns has been locked in a bitter
political war with Norman, his onetime confidant. In recent months
the Democratic chairman has vowed to find a candidate to run
against the congressman. Norman first courted the Rev. Al Sharpton
before turning to City Councilwoman Annette Robinson, both of whom
ultimately decided not to run against Towns.
Ford, however, has eagerly dived into the race. He has been
adept not only at raising money he worked as a fund-raiser for
President Clinton's last campaign, as well as for the campaigns of
former Mayor David Dinkins, former Gov. Mario Cuomo and Ruth
Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president but also at
focusing his attacks on Towns.
For his part, Towns said he had long been prepared for a strong
challenge, but he dismissed Ford as a political aspirant who has
not demonstrated much community involvement.
For more than a year now, the feud between Towns and Norman has
occupied center stage in Brooklyn politics. For many years, the two
men operated as if they were political father and son. But in the
last two years, the two Democrats began sparring, first over
competing sets of delegates to the party's convention to select
judicial candidates, a race that Norman won.
Last year, after supporting Sharpton's mayoral campaign in the
Democratic primary, Towns endorsed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the
general election, a move that Norman called a final straw and an
act of party betrayal.
NEW YORK When it came on Saturday, New York state's first
death-penalty verdict in decades showed that capital punishment
remains a tangled political issue long after its reinstatement in
New York and nationally.
Charles Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney whose office
prosecuted the case, has staked out an unusual position that is
making him a symbol of the enduring potency of the debate over the
ultimate penalty.
As district attorney, Hynes has sought death sentences in five
cases, far more than any other prosecutor in the state, winning him
praise from death-penalty proponents as a prosecutor who is willing
to make the threat of execution real.
But as a candidate for governor in the crowded Democratic field,
Hynes is startling audiences across the state with passionate
criticism of the death penalty. Hynes is the only Democratic
candidate who persistently brings up the issue and promises if
elected to work to repeal the death-penalty law, whose passage was
a central theme of Gov. George Pataki's campaign four years ago.
