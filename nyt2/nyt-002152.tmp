The White House has argued that Bruce Lindsey, a longtime friend
of President Clinton who serves as deputy White House counsel,
should not have to tell Starr's grand jury about his conversations
with the president about the Lewinsky matter.
White House lawyers say Lindsey's conversations are protected by
the attorney-client privilege, which shields most communication
between a client and lawyer. Starr argues that the privilege does
not apply to government lawyers, like Lindsey, who have information
about criminal behavior.
The Justice Department and the Treasury Department, which
oversees the Secret Service, have asserted that the president's
security detail should not be forced to cooperate with Starr's
inquiry because doing do would undermine the essential trust chief
executives must have in those who protect them.
Johnson last month sided with Starr and ruled against the
Clinton administration on both the privilege claims, which prompted
appeals.
In court documents filed in the past week, Starr and his team of
prosecutors argue that Lindsey and the Secret Service have
information vital to determining whether Clinton or others
obstructed justice by trying to cover up his alleged sexual
misbehavior.
In its order expediting consideration of the Clinton
administration appeals of Johnson's orders, the three-judge panel
set arguments for June 26 in the Secret Service case and the week
of June 29 on the Lindsey matter.
 A. Raymond Randolph, 54, who was deputy solicitor general
under Robert Bork. Named by President Bush to the Washington-based
Court of Appeals in 1990, Randolph has a reputation as an
intellectual and a tough questioner during oral arguments.
 Judith W. Rogers, 58, a Harvard-educated former assistant
attorney general who served as chief federal judge of the
Washington district before Clinton elevated her to the appeals
court. Prior to her appointment to the federal bench by President
Reagan, Rogers served as a corporation counsel for the District of
Columbia government.
 David Tatel, 56, a liberal who served in the Carter
administration as director of the Office of Civil Rights at the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Appointed to the
appeals court by Clinton in 1994, Tatel is admired by liberals and
conservatives for his fairness and thorough questioning during oral
arguments.
WASHINGTON The House narrowly approved a plan Friday to cut
taxes and spending far more deeply than last year's bipartisan
balanced budget deal. The move puts Republicans on another
ideological collision course with the White House over the size and
role of the federal government.
