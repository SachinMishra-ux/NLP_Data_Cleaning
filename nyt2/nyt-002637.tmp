Welfare recipients generally have abortions at a higher rate
than other women: In New Jersey, in the quarter ending December
1991, the abortion rate for the welfare population was 27 per 1,000
compared with 4 per 1,000 for all New Jersey women of child-bearing
age. And although the abortion rate in New Jersey, and nationwide,
declined between 1991 and 1996, the abortion rate among New
Jersey's welfare recipients rose during the same period. By 1996,
the Rutgers report found, the gap had widened further, with 29
abortions per 1,000 women receiving welfare, compared with 3 per
1,000 women in the general population.
But the state has not accepted those findings, calling the
report a draft that needs substantial revision.
In a May 14 letter to the research team, the Department of Human
Services said the document should be labeled a draft, criticized
the methodology and asked for a reworking that would explain all
the difficulties of determining whether it was the welfare policy
that had caused the increase in abortions. The letter also
questioned the validity of studying the behavior of the welfare
population before and after the law changed, since the changes
themselves may have altered that population, causing some
recipients to get off welfare, and other people to avoid it.
Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Human Services, denied that interpretation. Rather, she said, the
state is committed to understanding what effects the family cap has
had, and is concerned about the release of draft findings based on
a methodology that the state says is flawed.
The question of how welfare recipients' reproductive decisions
are affected by a family cap, removing any financial incentive to
have more children, has been one of the most hotly argued issues in
the debate over welfare.
Some conservatives have argued that family caps help discourage
welfare recipients from having more babies than they can support,
and prevent long-term welfare dependency. But in an unusual
political alliance, the Catholic Church and conservative Christian
groups joined with advocates for the poor to argue against family
caps, on the ground that they would encourage abortion and increase
child poverty by forcing welfare families to stretch their meager
benefits too far.
New Jersey's family cap went into effect in 1993, under a
federal waiver allowing the state to conduct welfare experiments.
Two years later, the federal welfare overhaul bill opened the way
for any state to adopt such a policy, and currently family caps are
in effect in 20 other states.
Last year, Ms. Davis' group, along with the American Civil
Liberties Union of New Jersey and Gibbons Del Deo, a New Jersey law
firm, filed suit charging that the family cap violated the state
constitution by interfering with women's reproductive rights and
treated children differently depending on their birth status.
In late February, in the course of preparing a summary judgment
motion in the case, Ms. Davis said, the lawyers asked the state
whether the final report from Rutgers, which had been long
scheduled for release in December, was available.
A lawyer in the attorney general's office gave them a copy of
the December report, which they shared with representatives of the
Catholic Church and others who oppose the family cap at a May 12
meeting. Ms. Davis said the lawyers challenging the cap had also
asked for, and been granted, permission to talk to the Rutgers
researchers.
