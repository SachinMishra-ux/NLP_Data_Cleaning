Moya's ability to get that job done steeled him for this one:
friend or not, Corretja must be dealt with.
For the first time since Wimbledon 1884, two sisters met in a
Grand Slam final when Venus and Serena Williams squared off in the
mixed doubles final with their respective partners, New Jersey's
Justin Gimelstob and Argentina's Luis Lobo.
The foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, at a news
conference at the United Nations, angrily rejected Butler's
conclusions, presented to the Security Council this week, that Iraq
was still withholding critical material and information on
biological, chemical and missile systems.
He dismissed as temporary and insufficient the oil-for-food
program, under which Iraq can now sell up to $5 billion in oil
every six months to pay for civilian goods. He said conditions were
continuing to worsen and more children were dying.
But in Baghdad on Thursday, a spokesman for the program, Eric
Falt, said a recent World Health Organization survey of Iraq had
found attendance at health clinics rising across the country, with
50 percent of patients interviewed saying they were getting the
full treatments prescribed, after suffering shortages of medicine.
The oil-for-food administrator in Iraq, Denis Halliday,
announced recently that he would be allocating money to improve
Iraq's run-down schools. Electricity systems and agriculture are
also getting larger shares of equipment and money with an increase
in the amount of oil allowed to be sold. The program was expanded
early this year by the Security Council, under pressure to do more
to relieve the hardships of Iraqis. 
In a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Clinton also defended a law now under attack by the
telecommunications industry that would provide reduced costs to
poor schools and libraries.
In his address to MIT's 2,400 graduates, Clinton challenged
states to make technology literacy a requirement for students to
graduate from middle school. He pledged to provide $180 million
over three years, starting in 2000, to train a team of teachers who
in turn would help train other teachers.
The president noted the high-technology industries already
employ more people than the auto industry did at its height in the
1950s. Yet, Clinton said rich schools are three times more likely
to have Internet access than poor schools, and white students are
more than twice as likely as black students to have a computer in
their homes.
There were reports that the FCC is considering suspending the
E-rate program, but an administration official said the White House
had no knowledge of any such move.
