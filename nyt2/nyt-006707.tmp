Why does Clinton do these things approve strengthening Chinese
missile forces, permit Saddam to slaughter his people, build the
prestige of the Iranian despotism, court dictators, and earn
nothing much more for the United States than a good view of the
backsides of our European allies as they walk away from us toward
the trade troughs of tyrannies? 
Let Clinton and his entourage conjure up phony rationalizations but we know, we know and so does Congress. Money. 
Like most of America's allies and partners, trade is his
overriding goal in dealing with the dictatorships trade, not
freedom, not human rights, not principle. He has lined America up
at China's trough, costing America $50 billion a year for the
privilege, and is now jostling for a similar place at Iran's. 
For the mirage of money, under the tutelage and rod of
China-trade lobbies, he leads America to suffer political loss and
humiliation, threats to its security and the end of principle in
foreign policy. 
I wonder by now is he even capable of seeing where American
principle lies? After all, it does not show on the balance sheet that is, not until some new Pearl Harbor, or invasion of Kuwait, or
some second explosion at the World Trade Center, something like
that.
ATLANTA -- Companies that plan to participate in Georgia's
soon-to-be deregulated natural gas market are maneuvering for
position with less than one week left before the Public Service
Commission sets ground rules for just how competition will work.
The PSC staff and representatives of the marketing companies,
including Atlanta Gas Light Co., held talks Thursday for the second
straight day, seeking an agreement on operational details of the
new system.
Under a new state law, sales of natural gas will be opened up to
competition later this year, much in the way long-distance
telephone service has been deregulated. Atlanta Gas Light Co. will
become a distribution company responsible for transporting gas to
homes and businesses. Marketing companies will be responsible for
selling gas to homes and businesses.
Shell Energy Services Co., a subsidiary of Houston-based Shell
Oil Co., became the third company Thursday to apply for
certification as a marketing company for natural gas.
Houston-based Enron Corp. and PGE Energy Services of California
have already filed papers. Up to a dozen companies are expected to
apply before the July 16 deadline. Competition begins Nov. 1.
