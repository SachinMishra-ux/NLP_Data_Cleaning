Q: Remember PC Tools for Windows? The file manager had a viewer
so you could toggle through files in many formats and see the
contents, then open, copy or delete. There was no waiting, and no
programs were launched for viewing. What current program offers the
same features for Windows 95?
PC Tools, from Central Point Software, was easily the best
Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS utility of its day. It competed with
Symantec's Norton Utilities, until Symantec bought Central Point
Software and discontinued the line.
PC Tools for Windows had two great features an option that let
you set up multiple desktops, and a file manager that let you
instantly view a data file. Those technologies found their way into
an early Windows 95 product, Norton Navigator. But that product had
a lot of problems, most notably the fact that it bogged down even
the most powerful of computers. Norton Navigator has since been
discontinued.
However, there is a product that's similar to PC Tools for
Windows. Mijenix's PowerDesk Utilities 98 has a lot of the same
features, including a file manager with a built-in file viewer. It
also includes the multi-desktop feature found on PC Tools. Best of
all, it won't bog down your system.
PowerDesk Utilities began its life about the same time as Norton
Navigator, as an early Windows 95 product from a company called
MicroHelp. That's the same company that developed UnInstaller, the
original third-party uninstall program for Windows. Mijenix now
owns PowerDesk and has done an excellent job of tweaking and tuning
it.
Q: I recently learned how to build Web pages, and I've put
together a nice little home page for myself. Now I want to put it
up on the Internet, but I'm kind of at a loss. How do I do this?
I'm on America Online do I need to switch to a different provider
to make my Web page available?
A: One of the best-kept secrets about America Online is that the
service gives each subscriber two megabytes of server space per
screen name for a personal home page. Since AOL allows you to have
up to five screen names, you could command as much as 10 megabytes
of server space!
You can post your Web site several ways. If you do a keyword MY
PLACE, you'll find an area that lets you post Web pages you've
created on your own. You can upload the files here, one at a time,
until you've delivered all your graphics and pages to the server.
But AOL also has an area called Personal Publisher (use that as
your keyword), which automates the process of building a Web site
by using a template. If you're a novice, this is the place for you.
You don't need to know anything about Hypertext Markup Language, or
HTML, the code in which Web pages are written. Building your own
page is as simple as filling in a form.
Once you upload your page, it's located either at the
members.aol.com or the home.aol.com server the system will tell
you where. You can then point your friends to the site by telling
them to look at the name of the server, followed by a slash and
your screen name. For example, if your screen name is JoeSmith and
your page was on the members.aol.com server, your site's address
would be members.aol.com/joesmith.
