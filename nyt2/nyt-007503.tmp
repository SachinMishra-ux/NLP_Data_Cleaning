All hope definitely seemed gone for Mexico at steamy-hot Stade
Lescure on Saturday. Belgium stormed to a 2-0 lead, the Mexicans
were playing a man short because of a questionable red card and
every legitimate Mexican opportunity was being kicked away.
The tie clouded Mexico's hopes of advancing out of the tough
Group E, which includes the favored Dutch, who defeated Korea on
Saturday. A win would have assured a trip to the single-elimination
second round.
Now tied with the Dutch with four points, while Belgium has two
(with a pair of ties) and South Korea none, Mexico must earn at
least a tie with the Dutch in order to keep its chances of
advancing since Belgium likely will beat South Korea.
The red card came against Mexico defender Pavel Pardo in the
29th minute, and by most accounts it was a questionable
interpretation of the back-tackle rule, which FIFA president Sepp
Blatter ruled should be an automatic red card and disqualification
from the game.
The call clearly devastated Mexico. Only minutes later Belgium's
Marc Wilmots put his team ahead with an easy boot into the back of
the net off a corner kick.
At halftime, Blanco said he told teammates to quit playing so
tentatively. But only three minutes into the second half it looked
as if Belgium would walk away with the victory when Wilmots got his
second goal on a nice individual effort to get clear in the Mexican
box and unleash the untouchable shot.
But Belgium didn't, thanks to a terrific effort by Ramon Ramirez
in the 55th minute that ignited his team.
Ramirez tried to take a pass in front of the Belgian goal and
work the ball past goalie Filip De Wilde. But as DeWilde tried to
converge on the ball before Ramirez could get off a shot, Belgium's
Gert Verheyen also crashed into Ramirez, clipping his heel from
behind.
Verheyen then received a red card from referee Hugh Dallas of
Scotland and Garcia-Aspe whipped in the penalty kick to make it
2-1.
The game-tying goal by Blanco was a thing of beauty, with
Ramirez taking the ball on a big run directly at the Belgian
defense, then chipping the ball across to Blanco.
