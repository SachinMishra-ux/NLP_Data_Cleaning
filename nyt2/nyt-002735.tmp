But the deduction was eliminated in 1986. Since then, as the
number of two-income couples has increased, more people have became
subject to the marriage penalty. And the pressure to fix the
marriage penalty has increased accordingly.
Michael Jordan may be the best basketball player in history. He
may have more trophies and rings and sneaker contracts than any man
on the planet. He may even, as Fortune magazine has just
calculated, have contributed $10 billion to the global economy over
the last decade.
But he has not yet made the big leap that, if Wall Street has
its way, is in the future for all sorts of athletes and artists:
the leap from marketable commodity to tradeable security.
Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street is securitizing
virtually everything that produces a predictable stream of cash.
Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars and fraternity
houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused airline
tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
The alchemy by which Wall Street turns stuff into securities
varies. The old-fashioned method is the stock offering, which has
been used by a number of sports teams. But there are risks for
celebrities who go public: both Debbie Reynolds' casino and Wilt
Chamberlain's restaurant chain bombed in the stock market.
Then there are derivatives, so called because their prices are
derived from the value of something else, like an index or a
security or a commodity. Some involve relatively straightforward
bets on things like the price of soybeans or Microsoft shares. The
infamous variety like the ones that got Orange County, Calif., in
trouble often involve wagers so arcane as to be inexplicable. In
the works are derivatives that let investors bet on the temperature
or rainfall in a geographic region.
But the really big idea on Wall Street today is securitization,
which began with home mortgages in the 1980s. Banks had made a lot
of them and wanted to sell them, but to whom?
Then someone had a bright idea. If Wall Street put together a
whole bunch of mortgages, the bundles would look almost like
traditional bonds. They would be relatively safe investments,
because even if one borrower defaulted, there would be plenty of
others still paying. Bond buyers, like mutual funds, pension funds
and amateur investors, jumped on these mortgage-backed securities.
This led to a creative burst on Wall Street. If securities could
be made out of mortgages, why not car loans, credit-card
receivables, business loans or bad debts?
The newest and sexiest twist involves using streams of income
from entertainers. In the first such deal, rock star David Bowie
sold $55 million of bonds last year backed by his anticipated
royalties.
