One of the foremost examples in the United States is the
so-called Meteor Crater in Arizona, which measures about 4,150 feet
across and 570 feet deep. There also are some fine specimens in
northern Ontario, according to Dort.
Craters are difficult to identify on Earth, as compared to the
moon, Dort said, because of foliage or other features covering the
surface. In addition, he said, many craters have been partly or
completed eroded away or filled in through human activities and
normal geological processes.
Meteorites also generate plenty of interest and have become
collectors' items. One type contains a combination of many
different elements. The other type is made largely of iron, with a
pinch of nickel thrown in. Most meteorites, but not all, contain
some iridium.
The largest meteorite ever found in the United States is the
Willamette Meteorite, which is 118 inches long, weighs 14 metric
tons and is deeply pitted and scarred on one side. It was found in
Oregon's Willamette Valley in 1902.
They generally are errant bits of asteroids or comets and are
pulled out of their orbit by the gravitational force of a nearby
planet, toward which they eventually hurtle.
When it meets Earth's dense atmosphere, a meteorite, traveling
at perhaps 20 or 30 miles per second, encounters a lot of friction,
which causes it to heat up, melt and break into pieces, Dort said.
Sometimes a meteorite will explode upon hitting Earth's
atmosphere. The resulting shards, as well as the force of such an
explosion close to Earth's surface, can create a large hole in the
Earth's crust.
But really, what are the odds of such a catastrophe in the
lifetime of anyone now living?
Dort thinks that we must scan the skies for objects headed our
way and that we should work on developing a system for intercepting
anything deemed to be on a collision course.
