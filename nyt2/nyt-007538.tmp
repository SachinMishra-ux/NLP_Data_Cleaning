Gardner was so shaken by seeing his best friend shot that he saw
a counselor, Darlene says. The boy has lived in this neighborhood
for a long time and seen a lot of violence, heard a lot of
gunshots, but this, Darlene says, was too close.
The boys live in the same trailer park, go to the same school
and played on the same baseball team. They are always together.
Gardner seems afraid to let Lynn out of his sight, Darlene says.
Amber, 13, was outside when Gardner ran up, yelling for her to
get her mother. She ran to the other trailer, but a neighbor kept
her from going inside. Through the doorway, she could see Lynn
lying on the floor and all of the blood.
Lynn keeps an eye on Amber, a seventh grader, she says, making
sure she stays out of trouble. He shoos away any boys who show an
interest in her. And as annoying as her big brother can be, Amber
says she can't imagine life without him.
The shooting of her brother has made her afraid. Her parents
don't let her go to the mall with friends or to the nearby park as
often.
Like his big brother, Mark An drews Jr., 12, plays catcher. He
is a seventh grader, a smart kid who skipped third grade. He built
a fort in the desert near the trailer park but is not allowed to go
there by himself anymore.
 Mark Jr. was outside playing his keyboard when Lynn was shot.
He dropped the instrument and ran for the other trailer.
There was nothing for a 12-year-old boy to do but wait. He
waited while paramedics loaded Lynn into the ambulance and then
waited at the hospital. Then, he waited three days for his brother
to come home.
The case was turned down for prosecution by a grand jury, says
Phoenix Police Detective Bob Hutchins, a 28-year veteran who
investigated the shooting.
No one will ever know for sure if the shooting was an accident,
he says, adding that he doesn't think the girl shot Lynn
intentionally.
