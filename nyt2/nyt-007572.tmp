ST. LOUIS The Diamondbacks, full of life after a three-game
sweep of the Reds in Cincinnati, appear to be falling back into a
rut against the St. Louis Cardinals.
Their bullpen unraveled, and when their hitters were given the
opportunity to help the Cardinals' bullpen come apart at the seams,
they couldn't get the job done.
The result was a second straight loss, 4-2, on Saturday night in
front of a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium.
Despite giving up four walks and three hits, right-hander Amaury
Telemaco managed to play Houdini and escape trouble to hold the
Cardinals scoreless in his first start as a Diamondback.
He had a 1-0 lead, in fact, thanks to a bloop ground-rule RBI
double by Karim Garcia in the fourth inning. The hit came off
right-hander Manny Aybar, making the start in place of injured
left-hander Kent Mercker.
The lead could have been bigger. Jay Bell and Garcia were
stranded at third and second, respectively, when Kelly Stinnett
fouled out to end the inning.
And, the Diamondbacks probably should have scored in the second
inning. Instead of waiting for a chance for Stinnett or Telemaco to
drive in Bell, who had singled and moved to third on left fielder
Ron Gant's error, Manager Buck Showalter sent Bell toward the plate
as Garcia made contact. Bell was easily thrown out by Cardinals
shortstop Royce Clayton.
Right-hander Willie Banks took over for Telemaco in the fifth
and challenged the Cardinals' 2-3-4 hitters, getting Delino
DeShields on a comebacker to the mound and striking out Mark
McGwire and Brian Jordan.
He surrendered singles to the first two batters, Ray Lankford
and Willie McGee, and those two men later scored Lankford on a
groundout by Tom Lampkin and McGee on a bases-loaded walk to
DeShields.
Right-hander Clint Sodowsky came in to face McGwire, and got him
on the first pitch on a fielder's-choice grounder.
