Van Poppel, though, hit third baseman Dave Hollins with a 3-2
pitch after Erstad's home run. Center fielder Jim Edmonds, the next
hitter, lined a single through the middle on a 3-1 pitch. Hollins
eventually scored on a ground ball by designated hitter Tim Salmon,
and Van Poppel then issued a four-pitch walk to right fielder
Garret Anderson. A two-out, run-scoring single by Palmeiro also
occurred on a three-ball count.
Angels right-hander Steve Sparks, whom the Angels purchased
Monday from Triple-A Vancouver of the Pacific Coast League, beat
the Rangers for the second time in six days after going 0-8 during
11 minor-league starts this season.
Sparks, who relies on his knuckleball, allowed only three hits
and three walks during the next 5 1/3 innings after a shaky first
frame.
It remains to be seen whether Van Poppel will receive an
opportunity to start Thursday's game at Arizona.
WASHINGTON Lawyers for Monica Lewinsky have been told that she
must agree to plead guilty to some offense to reach an agreement
with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who is investigating
her relationship with President Clinton, said a person with
knowledge of the investigation.
Ms. Lewinsky's new legal team is pressing Starr to grant her
full immunity from prosecution in exchange for her testimony, in
which the former White House intern would acknowledge a sexual
relationship with the president, said the person, who insisted on
anonymity.
But in early talks with her lawyers, the person said, Starr has
insisted that he would end the criminal investigation of Ms.
Lewinsky only if she would agree to a guilty plea. It was unclear
if she would be required to plead guilty to a misdemeanor or
felony, and what sort of punishment might be imposed on her as a
result.
Details about the negotiations between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's
new legal team, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein, were first reported
on Saturday in The Washington Post.
It was not immediately clear whether Cacheris and Stein,
prominent Washington lawyers who were hired by Ms. Lewinsky's
family early this month, had been able to obtain a deal for their
client that was any better than the one that had been offered by
Starr to her previous lawyer, William Ginsburg.
Any statement by Ms. Lewinsky that she had sex with the
president would be a problem for Clinton, who has said in a sworn
deposition that he had never had a sexual relationship with the
former intern.
