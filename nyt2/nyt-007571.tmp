Baseball's sluggers have always lived in a specially reserved
loft, receiving far more attention than anyone else in the game
because they can consistently accomplish the most difficult feat in
the game hitting the ball over the fence.
So when the rare ones come along, the type who hit them farther
than anyone else ever has, the attention dial is turned up
considerably. McGwire knows very well what will happen if he gets
within striking distance of Roger Maris' single-season home run
record of 61.
The media circus will descend upon him to the point where he
will feel smothered. McGwire said he felt stifled last week when
the Cardinals came to Bank One Ballpark and then to Houston, cities
where he had never before played.
This is the same freckle-faced kid who came out of Southern
California and was blown away when reporters constantly wanted to
talk to him during his first year in the majors in 1987, when
McGwire shattered the rookie record for home runs with 49.
But that's where McGwire is wrong. He's now playing in a city
that appreciates and recognizes greatness, not what's become the
wasteland in Oakland, where he spent his first 10 years.
During his first years in the majors, one of McGwire's biggest
problems was his reluctance to say no to most requests. His mother
and father, both of whom are in St. Louis this weekend, taught
McGwire and his three brothers to be respectful of others.
McGwire has learned to say no, both to reporters and fans. He's
had to. He is still one of the most accommodating superstars in the
game, a trait that has made him one of the most well-liked athletes
in sports.
Along the way, McGwire has probably shattered some fans'
perception of him. But it's never been spiteful or malicious.
The spotlight will become brighter during the All-Star Game
festivities, where tickets to the home run-hitting contest might
become a tougher ticket than the game on Tuesday.
McGwire is no zoo animal. He is, however, the greatest spectacle
in the game today. Just remember, he is human. Pedro Gomez can be reached at pedro.gomez(at)pni.com via e-mail.
