The bill's sponsor, Assemblywoman Nettie Mayersohn, a Queens
Democrat, has been a loud and relentless advocate, spending years
trying to embarrass Silver into allowing a vote. And many Assembly
members have said the public pressure on them to act grew greatly
with the news last fall that one man, Nushawn Williams, had
infected more than a dozen women and girls in small towns in
western New York.
On the last day of the legislative session, Silver gave in to
pressure from other Democrats. Many genuinely supported the
measure, while others feared their failure to act on it would be
used against them as a campaign issue by Republicans. Silver
negotiated some minor changes with Ms. Mayersohn, then freed
legislators to vote as they pleased. The bill squeaked through two
committees, by votes of 11 to 10, before going to the floor.
Despite the resolution of the AIDS issue, many legislators
expressed disappointment about a session that seemed much more
promising months ago. In April, many lawmakers were euphoric after
the Legislature enacted the least-tardy state budget in five years.
For the first time, the budget was hammered out in conference
committees, with the involvement of many rank-and-file legislators,
rather than in secret meetings among state leaders.
But for those same lawmakers, the last seven weeks of the
session and the final 48 hours in particular were a distinct
letdown. Pataki, who is running for re-election, took much of the
wind out of the Legislature's sails by vetoing $1.6 billion in
spending it had approved, and the rest of the session sank into a
morass of recriminations and election-year politicking.
One of the final deals made by lawmakers strikes at health
insurers that deny people coverage for treatment, whose only option
is to appeal the insurer. Instead, the agreement reached by Silver,
Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno would allow patients
to appeal a denial of treatment including of experimental
treatments to an independent arbiter chosen by the state Health
Department. Both houses were expected to approve the bill Thursday
night.
The bill could neutralize what was shaping up to be an issue in
the gubernatorial race. Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, Pataki's
former protegee who hopes to run against him as a Democrat, has
made attacks on health maintenance organizations and calls for an
outside appeals process a centerpiece of her campaign, and some of
the other Democrats in the race have joined in.
Silver, Pataki and Bruno also agreed on an expansion of the
state's health care program for children of low-income families,
which will be paid for by New York's share of a $24 billion federal
grant program established last year. About 420,000 children are
eligible for the program, but fewer than half that number are
enrolled.
The state program, called Child Health Plus, makes health
coverage available at little or no cost. Income limits would be
raised from $35,000 a year for a family of four, for example, to
$40,000 expanding eligibility by about 35,000 children. It would
also lower the fees charged to some families, and move some
children in the program into Medicaid, the federal health program,
giving them a wider range of benefits.
The most prominent proposal to fade away in the waning hours,
and the one Pataki had pressed for most vigorously, was one that
would have ended parole boards' ability to release violent felons
from prison early. Under the measure, felons would have been
required to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.
As with many of the issues taken up this year, the Democratic
Assembly leaders were reluctant to go along, but were aware that
the governor's position was popular, and that Democrats might pay a
price at the polls for opposing it.
