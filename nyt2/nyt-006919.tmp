Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets
from Asia. A longer runway would bring more tourists, and would
also help business.
Gary Gifford, the president of the Maui Land Pineapple
Company, points out that the short runway makes it more difficult
to get fresh pineapples to market.
On the west coast of the island of Hawaii, a new international
airport generated a 26 percent increase in tourist arrivals in
1997. But the anti-growth forces will not countenance a bigger
airport on Maui and, so far, they are winning. 
The floundering economy sets the stage for a political showdown.
Hawaii is a Democratic bastion; the state has not had a Republican
governor since 1962. That may change in November.
Cayetano is being challenged by Linda Lingle, the mayor of Maui.
Lingle is not exactly what a political consultant would prescribe:
she is a white Jewish Republican, born in St. Louis. But she has
gained notice on Maui for getting things done and for drawing
business people into the administration.
Her finance director, Travis Thompson, is a former Boeing
employee who thought he was retiring to Maui. Lingle points out
that, while the rest of the state struggles to grow, Maui has added
jobs in five of the past six years.
Can she win? Lingle has been twice reelected as mayor, even
though registered Democrats in Maui County outnumber Republicans by
about 30 to one.
The powerful union leaders remain staunch Democrats; the rank
and file are not so sure. A recent poll put Lingle solidly ahead of
Cayetano, 49 percent to 35 percent.
