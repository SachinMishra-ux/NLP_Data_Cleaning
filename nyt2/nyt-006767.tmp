And the French national soccer team stood nearby, under the
stars on a beautiful Paris night Thursday, indeed looking like a
team ready to march under the arc next month triumphantly holding
the World Cup trophy.
On the way to pounding out the most one-sided victory of the
tournament thus far, much to the delight of 80,000 adoring,
flag-waving, anthem-singing fans who made for an unforgettable
scene at Stade de France, the French were close to perfect.
The victory was surprisingly one-sided considering the expected
strength of the Saudi team. There were spectacular plays that
included long, perfectly placed passes, crisp midfield moves by
superstar Zinedine Zidane and a beautiful back-heel pass from Youri
Djorkaeff to Bixente Lizarazu for France's final goal.
The French took a whopping 16 shots in the game, seven of them
on target and four hitting the net.
But, alas, Zidane was one who seemed to get too caught up in the
emotion in the 70th minute. And Zidane's grave mistake might be the
only reason France today cannot be talked about in the same breath
as Brazil, Germany and Italy, who have had similarly overwhelming
efforts in this tournament.
Zidane was red-carded by referee Arturo Brizio of Mexico after
an obvious hard tackle from behind. Earlier in the day, FIFA
president Sepp Blatter and France '98 president Michel Platini
scolded referees for not sufficiently enforcing the
tackle-from-behind rule.
Referees listened. In the South Africa-Denmark game earlier in
the day, a nearly unheard-of three red cards were issued. And early
in France's easy victory, Saudi Arabia's Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi was
issued a red.
Some of those calls might have been questionable under some
officials' interpretations. But Zidane, who was playing superbly
well to the 70th minute, did not argue.
The severe foul not only caused France's best player to be
ejected from the game, but by rule Zidane will be ineligible for
the next two games the second of which will be a round-of-16
elimination game.
Still, France can only feel good about Thursday's effort. It is
guaranteed of advancing, and the offense and defense could not have
looked better, after a similarly strong 3-0 victory over South
Africa in France's opener.
