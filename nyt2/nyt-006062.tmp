Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.
The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
