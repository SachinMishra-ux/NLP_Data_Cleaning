ELTON, England As the army of journalists and fleet of
satellite trucks withdraw for now from this quiet village, Louise
Woodward will soon make her way to the local pub and market without
the world watching.
But even those who campaigned to bring home the town's most
infamous daughter admitted that they could never again see her in
the same way, that just below the surface of daily routine and
pleasantries will exist a longing for answers.
The young woman who dreamed of becoming an actress is destined
for a life less ordinary, some specialists say. Made famous by a
trial observed around the globe and forever tainted by her
manslaughter conviction in the death of Matthew Eappen, an infant,
Woodward now walks the same path as others who became known for
their misdeeds.
Bybee compared Woodward to celebrity athlete O.J. Simpson,
accused and acquitted of murdering his wife and her friend.
Afterward, Simpson was dumped by his girlfriend, heckled on the
golf course, and snubbed by neighbors. Shutterbugs waited at every
corner, and he contemplated fleeing the country.
While channel-surfing at home last fall, Simpson called Court TV
during its broadcast of Woodward's trial. The fallen football
legend wanted to express his support for the frightened British au
pair one outcast to another.
As a convicted felon in a baby's death, Woodward should not
expect that those among the throngs which rallied for her during
the trial will welcome her with open arms if she tries to get close
to them.
 Her 14-year ordeal then became a roller-coaster ride of
headline-grabbing trials, convictions, and a series of appeals.
Earlier this month, a Superior Court judge overturned LeFave's
conviction, finding that the testimony of child witnesses had been
tainted by faulty interviewing. The state has appealed; if
prosecutors win, she returns to prison.
 LeFave said she lost a lot: eight years of her life in a
prison cell, her mother to cancer, her married life to stress and
her good name. She has never fully recovered.
Though she's technically an innocent woman and has been free for
nearly three years, LeFave said she sometimes lies awake all night,
her nerves worn raw by the experience. She said Woodward may have
the same anxieties.
LeFave, 40, has said she lives a closeted existence, rarely
leaving her Ashmont apartment, fearful of being recognized. At a
recent Elton John concert, she realized the joy had been torn from
her life.
