Unbelievably, he caught a good lie and managed to smack an
8-iron to 12 feet for his fifth and final birdie of the day against
one bogey.
Lehman, who has finished third, second and third in the past
three Opens, was cautiously optimistic about his 68, which included
three birdies on his last four holes.
Knowing how fickle the Olympic Club can be, there seems no other

Leeland McElroy, a second-round draft pick by the Cardinals in
1996, was released Thursday after several attempts to trade him
failed.
McElroy, from Texas AM, struggled during his two seasons. He
became expendable with the off-season additions of running backs
Adrian Murrell, Mario Bates and draftee Michael Pittman, plus kick
returner/wide receiver Terry Metcalf.
Last season, McElroy gained 424 yards on 135 carries for an
average of 3.1 yards a carry. He scored two touchdowns and started
eight games for a team that was the NFL's worst rushing team.
They have signed all but their top two 1998 draft picks, Andre
Wadsworth and Corey Chavous, after Thursday's signing of former
Arizona State player Pat Tillman, a seventh-round draft pick. 
CINCINNATI In the city where the Big Red Machine once ruled
the baseball world, it seemed a bit strange that an expansion team
could sweep a road series.
The Diamondbacks are not quite ready for that kind of notoriety,

But after Thursday's 4-2 victory at Cinergy Field completed a
three-game sweep of the Cincinnati Reds, the Diamondbacks hope the
momentum carries into the remaining five games of this eight-game
trip.
