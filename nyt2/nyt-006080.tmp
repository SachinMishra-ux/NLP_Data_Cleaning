KELSO-COLUMN AUSTIN Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed
as much for marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one
of the inventors of the Johnny-Light. Two years ago, Bradford, a
resident of Burleson near Fort Worth, gave up a $90,000-a-year job
as an electrical engineer to market the device. The Johnny-Light
warns women in the middle of the night if some bonehead has left
the toilet seat up. (Kelso, Austin American-Statesman) Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
CSIBLEY-COLUMN ATLANTA Ellen Bryan Mrs. Wright Bryan died at the age of 93 years. It's funny the things that stick in
your mind about a person you don't know well, but cherish like you
cherish unexpected laughter and a crazy, odd meeting. Mrs. Bryan's
husband was editor of The Atlanta Journal, a newspaper we on The
Atlanta Constitution considered our unlikely, unloved competition.
But we did like the Bryans and rejoice in Ellen's humor and
goodwill.(Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED 6/16.
MCCARTY-COLUMN We live in an enlightened age, right? More
women are running companies, fighting fires, mending bones. So
what's wrong with Hollywood? There women are given the boot just
about the time they develop the grace, wisdom and strength that
truly makes them attractive. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
REAL-LIFE So, let that Giuliani fellow worry about all those
folks up in New York City, the ones who need a hug and a smile and
a weekend in the country. I've got enough to keep me going right
here. And that's no exaggeration. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

WOODWARD-IMPACT (Boston) -- When the first reports appeared
about Matthew Eappen's death, the case against Louise Woodward was

most soap operas. By Peter Canellos (2 takes)
