She had come early to the park to enjoy some peace and quiet.
The whir of cars zipping overhead on the bridges provided a lulling
comfort. She is also at ease with the idea that Brooklyn prospered
after joining the city.
She planned to go to Manhattan later in the day to see what
birthday events she would run into. She had already celebrated in
her own way on Friday.
Nearby, a parks worker watered a lawn with a view of spans and
skyscrapers. On a shaded cobblestone walk, a fashion photographer
clicked away at a model who kept a cool expression while wearing a
winter coat and scarf.
Waves of weary and hopeful immigrants arrived in this city to do
just that. Dave Creary, whose mother brought him from Jamaica when
he was 6, was amazed at the variety of people who have settled in
the city.
On Friday afternoon, he was high on his neighborhood leaning
over a balcony at the Panorama of New York City, a scale model of
the five boroughs inside the Queens Museum. He was searching for
his Queens Village house, which was somewhere between Kennedy
Airport and the rows of identical homes. The city was laid out
before him: the cluster of red-brick buildings near the sands of
Coney Island, the tiny bridges stitching together the metropolis,
and the thicket of towers crammed into Manhattan.
Like most New Yorkers, he had driven past the museum without
ever having gone inside. He was too busy working, until his uncle,
who was visiting from London, talked him into a day trip. Creary
looked at the model city, awed by its size. To him, however, urban
progress was measured not by soaring towers but by much smaller
details.
On Orchard Street, the restoration went back a bit further as
the road was paved with cobblestones. On Saturday morning, Larry
Shapiro and his wife, Patricia Sousa, turned the corner from Broome
Street hoping to see the other vintage sights on the Centennial
Block. But the gates of most stores were still down, and some would
not go up at all, since the Jewish shopkeepers would be observing
the Sabbath.
Still, they had come to the street to pay their respects to
tradition and heritage on the Lower East Side. The faces had
changed, but some things were the same.
The title of top driver in the rough-edged world of stock car
racing has always carried with it an additional designation:
target.
Win too often and there will be as many fans hating you as
loving you. There will be drivers who will not hesitate to run you
into a wall and others who might even cheat to keep you from
winning a race.
