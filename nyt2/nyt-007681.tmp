The Liberty, playing its first home game of the season after a
dismal 1-4 road trip, desperately needed something. New York lost
to Utah on Monday by 71-60. The home-court advantage hardly seemed
to provide an inspiration at the start as the Liberty fell behind
by 10-2 and then by 15-4. Dydek showed a deft shooting touch,
hitting all five of her field goal attempts in the first half and
adding a pair of free throws for 12 points. But Hampton had 10
points in the first half and the Liberty was able to close the gap
to just three at the half, 32-29. 
In the second half, Rebecca Lobo, who had just two points in the
first half, got the Liberty started by scoring the team's first
eight points of the half for its first lead since 2-0. Hampton
continued to work inside in the second half, while Dydek was unable
to get her shot off. Sidelined by foul trouble for much of the
second half, Dydek attempted just one field goal and made it to
finish a perfect 6-of-6 from the floor. But Hampton outscored her
by 12-2 after halftime. 
In the first meeting between these teams, Hampton had settled
for outside shots and was just 2-of-8 from the floor for five
points. Lobo was 2-of-11 in that game, timid to bring the ball
inside.
Vickie Johnson, who had 17 points, gave the Liberty the lead for
good, 60-59, with a pair of free throws with 2 minutes 55 seconds
to play. Hampton scored inside around Dydek on the next possession,
and Johnson followed that with a 3-point field goal from the corner
with one second left on the 30-second clock to give New York a
65-59 advantage. Teresa Weatherspoon, who had eight assists and six
steals, added a free throw and then Johnson swiped the Starzz's
inbounds pass and went the distance to complete an 11-0 run.
But conditions Sunday were hardly ideal for the Astros, who
faced an unfavorable pitching matchup at least on paper and
went to battle without Billy Wagner and Doug Henry, their two top
relief pitchers.
Not a problem. The Astros scuffled their way to a win loaded
with redeeming value for pitchers Pete Schourek and Mike Magnante,
who joined Trever Miller to stifle the Reds and help the Astros
complete their first series sweep of Cincinnati since 1992.
Schourek, who was coming off his worst outing of the season,
pitched six solid innings to claim his fourth victory, and Magnante
retired the final two batters for save No. 1 a day after blowing
a 5-2 lead and displaying faulty command.
Wagner has a tired arm and was given the day off. Henry has been
sidelined for the first five games of a seven-game homestand with
soreness in his right elbow. Both should be available tonight when
the Astros open a two-game interleague series against Minnesota.
Schourek left with a two-run lead after six innings, and Miller
and Magnante made it stand up as the Astros won for the 11th time
in their last 15 games.
And this was no easy save. With one out and two men on in the
ninth, Dierker traded lefties, lifting Miller for Magnante with
All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin coming up.
