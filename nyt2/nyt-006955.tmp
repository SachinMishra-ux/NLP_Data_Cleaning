Still just in case backdoor negotiations are continuing to
see if any kind of legislation might be revived. House Speaker Newt
Gingrich suggested a much scaled-back version Thursday, but he
offered few details.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., is teaming with Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, to fashion a new bill that would keep the key regulatory
and tax penalties intended to discourage smoking, but without the
extra baggage from both parties that ultimately brought down the
original bill sponsored by John McCain, R-Ariz.
Republicans would like to immunize themselves from the tobacco
issue by passing a narrow bill to encourage education and other
efforts to reduce teenage smoking. The House leadership's version
would contain no tax increase.
Without revenue, such a bill would allow Republicans to say they
are doing something to cut teen smoking but avoid the charge that
they are raising taxes and expanding government with the big new
federal programs.
The tobacco legislation has taken so many surprising turns dead one day and alive the next and has developed so many
shifting political crosscurrents that even seasoned lobbyists won't
hazard a guess as to what will happen next.
Conservative publisher Bill Kristol said Republicans will
probably go home for the July 4 recess to see how voters react. If
there's a big yawn, as Kristol suspects, nothing more will happen.
But Democrats clearly smell an issue. Tobacco companies are now
the Great Satan of American society, polls show. And while polls
consistently show that most people hold smokers, not tobacco
companies, responsible for their smoking, sentiments reverse when
it comes to teenagers.
Yet when asked what teens do that most concerns them,
Fitzpatrick's polls show 39 percent say drugs; 17 percent say
gangs, crime and random violence; 9 percent say reckless driving
and another 9 percent alcohol; 7 percent say sex; and 2 percent
answer smoking.
SAN FRANCISCO After anguishing for weeks over how to cope with
Viagra mania, Kaiser Permanente, the nation's biggest HMO, will
announce plans Friday to exclude coverage of the popular blue pill
for male impotence.
In addition, the HMO's new national policy will apply to other
prescription treatments for erectile dysfunction, including
suppositories and pills not yet on the market.
