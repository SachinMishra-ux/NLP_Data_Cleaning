While some women with children are released immediately, others
are held for months, separated from their children. Lawyers said
that clients with identical cases might be treated differently from
one month to the next.
Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees say that these
irregularities are an especially urgent issue now because the
swiftness of deportations under the new law makes the need for a
good, timely defense more critical than ever.
Under the old law, people who requested asylum were allowed to
stay in the country while their cases were heard by immigration
judges. If the judges ruled against them, they could appeal to the
Board of Immigration Appeals and then the federal courts, a process
that could take a year or more.
Now, detainees are under pressure to prepare a compelling case
quickly and lawyers say this is a difficult task for people
behind bars. Instead of freely searching for lawyers and preparing
their cases, detainees who do not speak English or know the laws of
the United States must often wait for lawyers to spot them and
visit them at detention centers, usually out-of-the-way places that
resemble jails and afford little privacy.
There is no way of knowing precisely how many people have been
affected adversely by the law, because the federal government does
not keep statistics of how many people who go through the new
procedures are denied asylum. But asylum seekers are always a tiny
percentage of the hundreds of thousands people who seek entry into
the United States every year.
From August of last year through the end of January, for
example, 1,300 new arrivals expressed a fear to return home. Of
those, 1,066 were sent to detention centers; the rest were
deported.
Karen Musalo, a co-director of the study, said that asylum
seekers sometimes mothers and their children are routinely kept
in detention in New York for months until a judge hears their case.
That is what happened to Sivajini Kadambarathnam, 35, and her
13-year-old son, Rajakumar. The two were stopped on March 12, upon
arrival at Kennedy Airport without documents from Sri Lanka, and
ordered detained, her immigration records show. But because no
children are allowed in the Queens detention center, Rajakumar was
sent to a center for juveniles in Miami.
Immigration officials said they were willing to release the boy,
but not the mother, to sponsors. But the sponsor would not take the
boy by himself, so the two remained in detention but separated, one
of her lawyers, Eileen Collins Bretz, said. Mrs. Kadambarathnam was
granted political asylum and released June 2, after nearly three
months in detention. Her son had been released a day earlier.
In Miami, where the influx of Haitian and Central American
immigrants seldom lets up, the Krome detention center routinely
releases asylum seekers who can show they have a place to stay,
said Stacey Taeuber, a pro-bono lawyer who works with detainees.
The policy was different last year: to be released on parole,
asylum seekers needed to post a $5,000 bond.
