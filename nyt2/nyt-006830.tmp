Last year the House voted to reduce the endowment's funding to
zero from $99.5 million; in the end, the agency received $98
million.
Thursday's vote got the ball rolling again, but many rank and
file Republicans seemed to have little appetite for the debate.
When the move to eliminate the agency came up in the House
Appropriations subcommittee on Interior, no one complained about
the agency itself.
Regula said that by simply abolishing the agency, the
subcommittee was presenting a neutral stance to the House so that
it could have an untainted debate.
But Democrats on the committee, sensing a winning issue for
them, drew out the discussion and tried, in vain, to include the
$98 million in the proposed $13.4 billion Interior spending bill.
The chief purpose of the bill, which is $800 million below
President Clinton's request and $700 million below this year's
appropriation, is to keep the national parks running.
Rep. Joseph McDade of Pennsylvania, a senior Republican on the
subcommittee, told Obey that he was sympathetic with his view and
would vote to support the endowment when the matter reached the
floor. But he said it would be a tactical mistake to try to include
the money in the subcommittee recommendation. He said that such an
effort would be defeated along party lines, making the endowment
even easier to kill on the floor.
In the end, the Democratic efforts to pay for the agency were
defeated on a voice vote. But whatever the full House does, the
Senate is expected to approve financing for the endowment.
With tobacco legislation dead, the Senate Thursday quickly
passed the first of the 13 spending bills that both houses are
required to pass to keep the government operating. It approved
$21.7 billion for flood-control, beach, dam and other water
projects in nearly every congressional district, an increase of
$109 million over the 1998 budget.
The vote was 98 to 1. Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., voted
against it but declined to explain his vote. He is facing a serious
election challenge from Rep. Mark Neumann, a conservative and
ardent opponent of government spending.
The bill will have to be reconciled with a House version. A
major difference is that the Senate would continue the $70 million
taxpayer subsidy of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which the House
would end.
