We'll find out today whether or not it's a good thing they're
getting another shot at the Lake Course. Pate's strategy is going
to be pretty simple.
Yet there was Payne Stewart, basket full and face awash in an
impish grin, trying to calculate the odds against repeating the
birdie-birdie-birdie finish that propelled him into the first-round
lead at the U.S. Open.
By closing with three consecutive birdies, Stewart finished with
a 4-under-par 66 and took a one-stroke lead over Mark Carnevale on
a day with the par-70 layout played to an average score of 75.
Well-tucked pins, firm fairways, tiny greens and thick rough
tinged with a heavy morning dew helped make scoring conditions
difficult for the 156 starters. Stewart was among nine players who
finished yesterday with under-par scores.
Others included Tom Lehman, Bob Tway, Joe Durant and Jose Maria
Olazabal, all at 68. John Daly, Jesper Parnevik and Jeff Maggert, a
Houston resident and Texas AM graduate, are at 69.
Several notables struggled, however. Past major-championship
winners Ben Crenshaw (82), Hale Irwin (80), Davis Love III (78),
Nick Faldo (77), Curtis Strange (77) and Corey Pavin (76) all find
themselves at least 10 strokes in back of Stewart.
But the well-hidden pins could not stop Stewart, who collected
five birdies and one bogey. He also drained two par putts from
beyond 12 feet in matching his best career start at the Open. In
1991, when Stewart won the title, he opened with a 67.
Stewart's biggest break came at No. 17, where he hit a driver
into the first cut on the right-hand side. Figuring he could not
reach the green, Stewart opted to play a 2-iron out of the tall
grass and caught it flush. The ball rolled. And rolled. And rolled.
All the way to the front edge of the green, where Stewart
drained the 45-footer for birdie and began an impromptu funky
chicken dance in celebration.
He followed with his worst swing of the day, a misdirected
2-iron into the right rough. From there, Stewart dug out an 8-iron
that skirted the edge of the green before reaching pin-high and
turning toward the hole. It eventually stopped 12 feet above the
hole, and Stewart canned the ticklish putt for his final birdie of
the day.
