Johnson, however, won't be grilling his opening week guests,
which include Harrison Ford and Peta Wilson on Tuesday; Arsenio
Hall, Gloria Estefan and Michael Douglas on Wednesday; Christine
Lahti and Kenny G on Thursday; and Gillian Anderson and Johnson's
former basketball coach, Pat Riley, on Friday.
A legendary stickler for preparation when he was playing
basketball, Johnson has also spent months doing rehearsal shows,
and taking lessons from a voice and interviewing coach.
Johnson is also getting pointers from Jay Leno, whom his show
competes against in several key markets, and Hall, a buddy and
former gabmaster.
Audrey Steele, senior vice-president for Zenith Media, a New
York consulting firm, was impressed by Johnson during a
presentation he made to promote the show to advertisers. But she
has her doubts the show will last beyond its initial 13-week run.
Whether the show is an air ball or a swish will be up to the man
whose been pulling surprises out of his trick bag for years.
Today he is remarkably robust by any definition of good health,
thanks to drugs that have been so successful that they have reduced
the virus to levels that cannot be detected. His wife and three
children are healthy.
-- HIS HEALTH: While by no means cured, he owes the appearance
of remarkable health to a Spartan lifestyle and modern medicine.
Like many AIDS patients on these new medications, he takes a
combination of three drugs, one a protease inhibitor.Side effects
can include nausea, vomiting, headaches, backaches or
gastrointestinal problems. The drugs are expensive, costing $12,000
to $15,000 a year.
-- HIS MOVIE THEATERS: He's a partner in a joint venture with
Sony Theaters in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, with expansion
plans for nine more cities. In Atlanta, where he already has one
multiplex theater at Greenbriar Mall, the financing plans for a
second one, in south DeKalb County, drew criticism because of
concerns that public money would be used. But the plan, which was
approved by the DeKalb County Commission and will be implemented
through the DeKalb County Development Authority, provides financing
and interest rate incentives and uses funds from private investors.
-- OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks'
first joint-venture partner, with a location in Los Angeles. He has
a joint venture with TGI Friday's, with plans to open restaurants
near his theaters. He also has formed California Urban Investment
Partners with the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
investing in commercial real estate. And he represents American
Express and Adolph Coors in TV ads. Recently, he joined Janet
Jackson and record industry executive Jheryl Busby in buying a
majority stake in Founders National Bank, California's only African
American-owned bank.
SAN FRANCISCO American League president Gene Budig will take a
break from his usual regimen of signing baseballs and getting into
ballparks for free to hand out enormous suspensions, fines and
other spankings to both the Kansas City Royals and Anaheim Angels
for their beanball war.
