But the Business Software Alliance, an industry trade that
sponsored the news conference, countered with a study which held
that a government bid to curb Internet encryption would cost users
at least $7.7 billion a year and $38.5 billion over five years.
The standoff led on Tuesday to a summit conference between
government and industry leaders, including Attorney General Janet
Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Thomas Constantine, head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
The trade group also released a report on the benefits of
electronic commerce predicting that direct business-to-business
transactions in cyberspace in 2000 would range from $66 billion to
$171 billion. By 2002, the study foresaw electronic commerce
reaching the $300 billion level.

BREAST-CANCER (Schenectady, N.Y.) Most women have heard war
stories about the mammogram, the first line of defense against
breast cancer. But for too many women, it is still the enemy, even

stages and improve the chances of recovery. By SYLVIA WOOD.
GLF-OPEN-FANS (San Francisco) Viewing the U.S. Open in person
must be like what toddlers hear their mothers yell near the candy
rack in the supermarket: No! No! No! No! No! No cheering, whooping
or hollering during play. In fact, try not to move or even sneeze.
No cameras. No cell phones. No beeping pagers. By RACHEL GORDON.
GLF-OPEN-MARTIN (San Francisco) The Casey Martin saga is
flourishing on the sacred turf of the U.S. Open. Martin addressed

cart to get around. By MARK FAINARU-WADA.
