Saturday parties pay about $200 (weekdays are about $170), and
if he leads the band, it's $100 more. There is a $10 bonus if he
lugs along his own amplifier, which he always does. When he plays
solo guitar in a restaurant, he has trouble getting more than $125.
A jazz club pays him no more than $50 to $75. In these days of
depleted jobs, fees can get insulting. Not long ago, Ausfahl
rebuffed an offer to play jazz in a prison in Albany for $80.
The splendiferous Bedens Brook Club lies at the end of a curving
road in Skillman, N.J., on the outskirts of Princeton. On a recent
Thursday evening, the Princeton class of 1953 had gathered for a
reunion dinner and dance. Don Anderson, a grizzled, 67-year-old
band leader and piano player, had hired Ausfahl and three others to
provide the evening's entertainment.
Even as the evening waned, the floor was seething with dancers.
The musicians had smiles on their faces. By no means was Jeff
Ausfahl wallpaper tonight. He was making music.
NEW YORK Fire marshals spent Sunday slowly searching what was
left of a row of Brooklyn buildings in search of definitive clues
to what caused a five-alarm blaze that killed a fire lieutenant and
left a fire captain severely burned and clinging to life, fire
officials said.
The injured captain, Scott LaPiedra, 40, of Staten Island, was
in critical condition Sunday night at Jacobi Medical Center in the
Bronx with second- and third-degree burns over more than 70 percent
of his body.
Investigators picked through the charred remains of the
three-story, wood and brick city-owned apartment building at 2530
Atlantic Ave. in East New York, which burst into flames Friday
night. No occupants of the building were hurt, but the blaze spread
to three adjacent buildings and took more than 220 firefighters
more than four hours to bring under control.
Fire officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they
suspect the fire started in a mattress in the apartment building
about 8:20 p.m.
But Washington said Sunday that fire marshals had not announced
a definitive cause of the blaze and that the scope of the damage
was complicating the investigation.
Fire officials said funeral services would be held Wednesday for
Lt. James Blackmore, 48, who died of a heart attack in the fire. In
addition to LaPiedra, five other firefighters injured in the blaze
remained hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns and other
injuries Sunday, fire officials said. None of their injuries was
considered life-threatening.
Blackmore, LaPiedra and the five other firefighters were injured
when they rushed onto the second floor of the burning apartment
building after a woman told them her elderly mother was trapped
there. As the firefighters searched for the missing woman, the
second floor collapsed, dropping them into a raging fire on the
first floor.
