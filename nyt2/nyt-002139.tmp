NEW YORK Alfred Kazin, author, critic, teacher and New York
intellectual, died Friday at his home on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan on his 83rd birthday.
For more than 50 years Kazin wrote prolifically about two great
subjects: American literature and himself. His territory was the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where he grew up; the streets of
the city, which he restlessly walked as if Herman Melville, Edgar
Allan Poe and Walt Whitman were beside him, and the landscape of
American literature, which he criticized with passionate intensity.
As a critic, Kazin said writers should be understood in relation
to their culture. Unlike the New Critics, he did not engage in
minute textual analyses, and he paid less attention to style and
form than to the relationship of a literary work to its time.
WASHINGTON When Kay Bailey Hutchison first ran for the Senate,
she depended on contributions from tobacco interests to help fill
her campaign coffers.
But more recently, the Texas Republican decided to kick the
habit, joining an increasing number of lawmakers who are trying to
distance themselves from an unpopular industry.
Hutchison said she became miffed at the tobacco companies after
their executives testified before Congress that they didn't believe
their product was addictive and they weren't trying to coerce young
people into smoking.
Since 1995, the senator has not accepted tobacco contributions
and returned several donations that came anyway, according to an
analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign reports by the
Center for Responsive Politics.
In the previous two years, Hutchison took more than $55,000 from
tobacco companies and their executives to help pay for two
expensive Senate campaigns. She first ran in 1993 in a special
election to fill the seat vacated by Lloyd Bentsen and later again
in 1994 for the regular six-year term.
Gramm spokesman Larry Neal suggested that shunning tobacco
contributions was largely a public relations ploy and that the
senator considered it sufficient that he disclose the sources of
his contributions.
He has also been one of the most vocal opponents of the
anti-smoking legislation now being considered by the Senate. The
measure would substantially increase the price of cigarettes and
give the federal government broad authority to regulate tobacco
products.
