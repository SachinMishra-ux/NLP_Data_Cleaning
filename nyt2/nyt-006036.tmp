 Questionable taste? If it's such a boom time in Silicon
Valley, why did a recent survey of car dealers find that the
lowball Ford Taurus was the top-selling car in Santa Clara County
last year, while the Mercedes-Benz E-class was 15th on the list?

The Federal Communications Commission decided Friday to reduce
by more than 40 percent the budget of a plan to connect schools and
libraries to the Internet.
Under bipartisan pressure from members of Congress who
maintained that the program would increase long-distance telephone
rates, the commission agreed to trim the program. All three of the
Democrats on the commission voted in favor of the plan, while the
two Republicans opposed it.
Under the new plan, $1.275 billion will be raised for the
program this year, down from an original maximum of $2.25 billion.
Long-distance carriers are required to provide most of the money.
About 30,000 schools and libraries have applied for about $2.02
billion from the program. Under the plan approved Friday, fewer
than two-thirds of those requests will be granted, which will skew
the distribution of money toward the poorest school systems.
The commission has already raised $625 million for the program.
Under the plan approved Friday, it will raise another $650 million
between July 1 and the end of the year.
Originally a relatively obscure offshoot of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the schools and libraries program
became the subject of a hard-fought political debate last week when
four powerful members of Congress urged the commission to cut off
its funding altogether.
ATT Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., the two biggest
long-distance carriers, have said in recent months that they
intended to pass the cost of their contributions to the program on
to consumers.
