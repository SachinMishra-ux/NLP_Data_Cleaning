As it stands, the umpires union has won so many concessions from
Major League Baseball that it is stronger than the leagues. There
is no way a sport's officials should have more control than the
league.
If for no other reason than perception alone, the leagues should
strip away some of the power the umpires have. Because the best
clubs advance past the regular season, the leagues should instill a
system where the best umpires work the playoffs.
In addition, a system that sent the worst umpires back to the
minors should be implemented. That would get some of the lazy
umpires to work as hard as they did when they first made it to the
majors.
After all, the big leagues are a place where the best players
stick around. If Travis Lee goes into a swoon and cannot find his
swing, you can bet the Diamondbacks will send him to the minors.
What would be the big problem with sending an umpire or two down
if they aren't doing their job up to a major league standard? Pedro Gomez can be reached at pedro.gomez(at)pni.com via e-mail. 
NORTH BERKELEY, Calif. From his study here, the Rev. W. Mark
Richardson sits amid the ivy-covered seminaries of the Graduate
Theological Union, enjoying an inspiring view of the Campanile, the
symbolic center of the University of California.
Richardson directs the Center for Theology and the Natural
Sciences, which Sunday convenes a four-day conference where
physicists, biologists, cosmologists and computer scientists from
around the world will talk about finding the hand of God in
everything from the genetic code to the Big Bang.
The conference, which runs through Wednesday at UC Berkeley's
Wheeler Auditorium, was designed for scientists who are also
believers in one of the three Abrahamic faiths Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.
Peacocke, a theologian at the University of Oxford and a former
genetics researcher at UC Berkeley, has witnessed almost
unimaginable advances in that field during the past four decades.
At the same time, scientific breakthroughs like the mapping of
the entire human genome pose new challenges for moral theologians.
For example, what are the implications for church teachings on
homosexuality if scientists establish a genetic basis for sexual
orientation?
