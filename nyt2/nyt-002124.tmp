MOSCOW By the time the first copies of Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's latest book landed at a Moscow bookstore on
Thursday, its arrival had been heralded far and wide. Excerpts were
published in half a dozen newspapers, and there were announcements
on radio and television just the kind of fanfare that might be
expected for a work by the great Soviet dissident, Nobel Prize
winner and tireless defender of Russia's battered soul.
And yet the phones were ringing all morning on Thursday at the
Russian Way bookstore a tidy, tiny haven of classical literature
on a street filled with features of the new Russia: beauty salons,
garish cafes, investment banks, currency-exchange booths.
Solzhenitsyn's loyal readers, many of whom share his alienation
from the culture around them, were calling in to ask when they
could come by and pick up their copies.
Solzhenitsyn, who rarely gives interviews, has not personally
promoted the book, which is currently available only in Russian.
Since his return in November 1994 after a 20-year exile, mainly
in Vermont, Solzhenitsyn has become one of the paradoxes of the new
Russia. Freed from the harsh Soviet censorship that made mere
possession of his books a criminal act, Solzhenitsyn more than
any other Russian writer or thinker has had ample opportunity to
address his public.
He was host of a talk show on national television. He has
traveled the country, lecturing and listening to what people have
to say. His works have been published not only in select literary
journals but in Argumenti i Fakty, Russia's most popular newspaper,
with a readership of 3.2 million.
The new book is a rambling collection of Solzhenitsyn's thoughts
and impressions about what he has seen and heard here over the last
four years. The picture he paints is relentlessly grim: a country
brought to its knees by the avarice and cowardice of its ruling
elite and by the West in particular the United States which has
wasted no time in taking advantage of Russia's weakness.
Many Russians share Solzhenitsyn's bitterness, and according to
Medvedev, that may be one of the reasons so few are ready to hear
him out.
But for Vera Moseyeva, a retired clerk who remembers the first
book by Solzhenitsyn that she ever laid her hands on (it was almost
in tatters by the time it had been carefully and secretly passed to
her), it does not matter what he writes.
WASHINGTON Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday removed the
last legal obstacle to the full operation of Oregon's landmark
assisted suicide law, declaring that doctors who use the law to
prescribe lethal drugs to terminally-ill patients will not be
prosecuted.
In her decision Friday, Reno overruled an opinion last November
by Thomas Constantine, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, an agency of the Justice Department. The DEA had
warned that the government would impose severe sanctions on any
doctor who writes a prescription for lethal doses of medicine for a
patient.
