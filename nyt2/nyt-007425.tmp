He is one of a handful of advocates who argue the Department of
Homeless Services, created with workers from the city's Human
Resources Administration, should be dismantled, saying it has
failed in its mission to move people out of the system and into
permanent housing.
About 5,000 families, including about 7,000 children, and about
7,000 single adults stay in shelters in the city on any given
night, officials said.
Union leaders also give the agency low marks, saying they never
supported its creation because they knew it would mean a loss of
jobs for city employees. In 1994, the agency had 3,000 workers; now
it it has 2,170. In addition, the Giuliani administration plans cut
the agency's budget by $20 million to $370 million.
The city has been contracting with nonprofit groups to take over
shelters and services for the homeless since the 1980s.
WASHINGTON Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions . It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour - not including the crew of 26 - can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
