Some of the responses in the survey, conducted by telephone from
November 1997 to March 1998, appeared a bit contradictory.
Seventy-three percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans
said negative campaigns caused cynicism among voters. But asked
whether the candidate or the consultant recommended going negative,
83 percent of the Democrats said consultants, as did 77 percent of
the Republicans.
Nearly every respondent agreed that the news media devoted more
coverage to negative strategies, and 83 percent said voters were
more apt to respond to negative campaigning. And nearly two-thirds
said the way the news media reported on politics had a great deal
to do with cynicism in the electorate.
While most consultants said negative campaigning was not
unethical, 41 percent said unethical conduct did sometimes occur.
More than half said the most common unethical practice related to
misrepresenting an opponent's positions in advertising or in
campaign oratory.
WASHINGTON As President Clinton prepares to go to China this
week, the central foreign policy drama in Washington is the
increasing congressional furor over the administration's engagement
policy, in particular the sense that Clinton is damaging national
security in his eagerness to promote relations with Beijing.
Congressional leaders, mostly Republican, argue that Clinton and
the executive branch are ignoring a pattern of Chinese exports of
dangerous nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile technology. The
motive, the critics say, is that the White House wants to avoid
imposing the sanctions that the law requires.
The administration is also under new attack for authorizing the
export of commercial satellites for launching aboard Chinese
rockets, a process that may have provided technical details that
China could use to improve the accuracy of its nuclear-tipped
missiles.
Administration officials complain that Congress confuses voting
on sanctions legislation with formulating a working policy on
nonproliferation and that Congress sets even stricter requirements
for Chinese behavior than international agreements do. In essence,
the officials complain, Congress does not allow the president to
take a broader, more nuanced view of American national interests.
They say the laws do not always provide the flexibility for the
executive branch to accomplish the real ends of the legislation,
less proliferation.
The intense argument between the executive and legislative
branches reflects two approaches for dealing with China that are
not, at their core, partisan differences, although the renewed
presummit debate is intensely political. Although Republican
leaders, including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
and Speaker Newt Gingrich are among Clinton's most vocal critics on
Chinese proliferation, Democratic senators including John Glenn of
Ohio have long shared some of the same concerns.
There is wide agreement that China has significantly improved
its record on nuclear, missile, chemical and biological exports
since the 1980s, when it advocated nuclear proliferation as a form
of anticolonial equity. China gave Pakistan the design for a
nuclear weapon and the materials to make it, and it shipped
missiles to the Middle East. Prompting China to curtail such
exports has been its growing international maturity, combined with
pressure and engagement from the United States, including the apt
use of sanctions.
The attention from Republicans is on whether the Chinese
government illegally contributed to the Democratic Party and used
advice from U.S. aerospace companies to improve its strategic
missiles. But that feeds on the more longstanding and bitter
argument over whether China remains a dangerous exporter to Iran
and Pakistan and whether its behavior is improving through
engagement.
