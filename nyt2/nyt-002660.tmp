That is why Ausfahl, at 43, finds himself doing about 75 gigs a
year in front of schoolchildren, arranged through Music Outreach, a
nonprofit outfit that puts on music demonstrations in public
schools in New York. The audience is highly appreciative. He needs
the work.
There has been an evolving decline in jobs for live musicians,
caught in the undertow of disc jockeys spinning CDs on much
improved sound systems and a more thrift-minded economy.
Local 802, the New York chapter of the American Federation of
Musicians, to which Ausfahl belongs, says union club dates in the
city have tumbled to about 6,000 a year from as many as 15,000 15
years ago. The union reports that the bar mitzvah business and
lower-end weddings have been almost totally lost to DJs, who
generally cost a fraction of what a band does.
Far fewer musicians find themselves able to play full time
anymore. Many teach. And it has become axiomatic among union
musicians that they must accept nonunion jobs to eat, a practice
the union tolerates.
It is not strictly economics that has brought on this state of
affairs. Many people do not want to hear someone who sounds like
Bruce Springsteen or Elton John. They want Bruce Springsteen or
Elton John, even if he is coming out of a box.
These days, musicians have come to feel like very expensive
bottles of wine, tasted less and less often.
It was a languid Monday void of gigs, and Ausfahl was working on
the attic of the tidy Teaneck, N.J., house that he shares with his
wife, Janet, and a parakeet named Henry. Ausfahl is a sinewy,
genial man with longish hair and sharply chiseled features.
He eventually received a degree from Berklee College of Music in
Boston, after several interruptions. For a spell, he played rock
music at bars and Holiday Inn lounges. For eight months in 1975, he
joined a band in Chicago called Even Steven. The musicians wore
silver satin suits and played soul music. One summer, he journeyed
to Virginia Beach and played military bases and wet T-shirt
contests.
He has never recorded his own album, though he has been on a few
bootleg records. In the past, he appeared at many familiar New York
nightclubs like CBGB and the Bitter End, but he has forsaken that
scene.
Within reason, he'll take whatever comes along. He has a steady
Friday night gig at a university club, where he plays swing and
dance music and also sings. Once he played a divorce. A man was so
elated when his divorce papers were signed that he threw a party.
In exchange for a free checkup, he recorded a song written by his
dentist to be entered in a contest to anoint a state song for New
Jersey. (It lost.)
