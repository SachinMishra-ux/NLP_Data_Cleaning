Like the campaign-finance bill, the tobacco legislation was
principally a Democratic initiative in a chamber controlled by
Republicans.
Like the campaign-finance bill, the tobacco legislation was a
symbol of the power of money in politics. The tobacco companies
pumped millions into their fight against the bill, blanketing the
country with advertisements at the local level.
But as combatants on both sides hurled charges and
countercharges Thursday, there were few indications that tobacco
would emerge as a major issue in November's elections. There are
few congressional races where the tobacco bill is much of an issue,
and in those places principally tobacco states such as North
Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky the major candidates almost
uniformly opposed the tobacco legislation.
Even so, the end of the tobacco bill may help some congressional
challengers portray their rivals as tools of big-money interests.
In the Seattle suburbs, for example, former Democratic
Representative Jay Inslee has been describing two-term GOP
Representative Rick White, who opposed the measure, as out of touch
with his constituents and too cozy with special-interest groups.
But the bitter divisions produced by the tobacco debate divisions produced by classic conflicts between freedom and
responsibility underscore the potency that taxes have had in the
American political discourse since colonial days. In the past
quarter-century, moreover, the pressure against hiking taxes has
grown substantially, as the public increasingly has adopted the
view that taxes are the oxygen of big government.
The notion that taxes themselves are as much an infringement of
personal liberty as other forms of government oppression was once
the province of conservative theorists. But it was popularized by
Ronald Reagan and then adopted gradually across the political
spectrum so much so that when the tobacco companies searched for
a weapon to defeat the Senate bill, they gladly picked up the
anti-tax cudgel.
Even proponents of the tobacco measure acknowledged this week
that once the legislation was transformed in the public debate into
a tax bill, the effort was lost. By acknowledging that the tobacco
bill would increase revenues, its proponents made the legislation
vulnerable to charges that it was a means of financing new
government spending.
In truth, the financial scope of the legislation ballooned so
much so that it popped. The bill the Senate walked away from this
week was around $150 billion bigger than the original agreement
worked out with state attorneys general one year ago this Saturday.
Most of that money was to be paid by consumers, not the tobacco
companies.
It quacked like a tax increase and waddled like a tax increase and in the end, it died like a tax increase.
