Pigs and chickens commonly landed on the spit, according to
early English writers documenting New World cuisines. It wasn't
long before the Spanish and English were firing up the pits and
cooking with rotisseries, but using the deer, cattle and sheep of
their fields in place of pigs or chickens.
Other parts of the world, meanwhile, picked up different methods
of fire-cooking from neighbors in the Middle East, Asia and Africa,
where Egyptians, Mongolians and desert nomads routinely cooked on a
spit over coals. The meats varied according to culture and
availability lamb in Mongolia, chicken and pork in southern
China, beef and lamb around Egypt.
In parts of China and Southeast Asia today, cooking outdoors is
part of the culture, and communal cooking pits made of stone still
mark a village common. The people eat the same foods their
ancestors cooked over coals typically, beef, pork and chicken. In
southern India, Thailand and Vietnam, with miles of ocean
surrounding them, fish is skewered and charcoal-braised.
Typical of those ovens is the Indian tandoori, a wood-burning
oven that gives everything from chicken to some breads a
distinctive smoky flavor, plus a red tinge that comes from smoke
penetration. Spicy marinades help, too: Curry mixtures and rubs are
popular in this country as a pre-grill seasoning.
The Scandinavians and Russians smoke their indigenous fishes, as
do native Inuits and Indians along the Pacific Northwest. There,
planked salmon, deriving its flavor from both the wood of the plank
it's cooked on and the smoke, is a delicacy.
In Japan, the famous cash crop bonito, typically used for fish
stock, is available fresh once a year. At that time, the fish are
filleted and grilled quickly to sear the skin crisp, but keep the
flesh moist. It is then chilled and served with a marinade of soy,
ginger, honey and vinegar, according to Elizabeth Andoh, a noted
Japanese cookbook author.
From Greece and Spain come shish kebabs skewered meat grilled
over fire, but in small chunks. Kebab history is loosely traced to
the Medieval days of sword-toting warriors who frequently ate in
the field during their battles. A deer, pheasant or rabbit was
caught, divided among the camp, and roasted in pieces skewered on
their swords over the campfire.
Today's grill warriors prefer lamb, brushed with lemon juice and
seasoned with oregano in Greece; and beef and pork (and
occasionally lamb) in Spain and Portugal.
The Portuguese, however, prefer cooking over a spit, roasting
the meat slowly over the coals. Home cooks are equipped with
rotisseries, and specialty restaurants called churrasqueira offer
the roasts, according to Portuguese cookbook author Carla Azevedo.
A Portuguese delicacy, fresh sardines, get the grill treatment
after being sprinkled with coarse salt. They're served as a tapas,
with a rosemary, garlic and lemon oil dip.
