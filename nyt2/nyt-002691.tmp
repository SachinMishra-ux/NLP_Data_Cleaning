The strategy closed down the passing lanes and frustrated the
NBA's all-time assists leader. Stockton had seven assists and five
turnovers.
The pick and roll Utah methodically destroys opponents with went
stale. Malone rebounded from poor performances in the first two
games and scored 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting. But the Jazz had
just 16 assists and shot 30 percent as a team.
The Bulls even checked Malone, who hit his first six shots.
Bulls coach Phil Jackson switched Dennis Rodman to guard Malone
instead of Luc Longley. Malone went just 2 of 4 in the second half
with Rodman badgering him.
There is, however, the small problem of when Chicago is running
its system to perfection. That is the simplest explanation for last
night a game in which the team with one of the game's best
offensive players won with offense being an afterthought.
In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a
routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as
the mid-1950s hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a
cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their
hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.
Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone
female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and
the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.
By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone Belding in time to take
over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had
written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at
Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in
retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety
stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New
York agencies with retail accounts.
Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her
career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000
so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George Halperin.
After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less
than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under
her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried
employee for many years.
She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio,
and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier
Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three
grandchildren.
GARDEN CITY, N.Y. His horse seemed to have won a Triple Crown.
And then he seemed to have lost it, and then won it, and finally,
he lost it, not by a nose, by a nostril.
