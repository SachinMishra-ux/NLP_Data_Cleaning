The Mets have had good starting pitching this season, but Mlicki
was the weak link with a 1-4 record and 5.68 era.
Nomo, the National League rookie of the year in 1995, has never
duplicated that season's performance of 13-6 and 2.54 era. His
record has slipped in each succeeding season, reaching 14-12 and
4.25 last season. He has maintained his strikeout total, but the
ratio of strikeouts per inning has slipped.
The decision of Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, to
designated Nomo for assignment that meant the Dodgers had to move
him within 10 days was a shocking development, apparently even to
Nomo and Nomura, who thought the Dodgers would just proceed with an
attempt to trade the 29-year-old native of Osaka.
Claire, however, explained that he took that step because he did
not want Nomo pitching for the Dodgers once he publicly declared
his desire to be traded. Nomo had planned to disclose that desire
at a news conference last Monday, but at that session, Claire
announced his action.
More than half of the 30 major league teams called Claire to
inquire about a possible trade, but apparently only a handful
seriously pursued Nomo. The Baltimore Orioles were interested, but
the Dodgers wanted a starting pitcher in return and the Orioles did
not have one to give them. Cleveland was another team that was said
to have tried to make a deal with the Dodgers.
The Mets willingly included Mlicki in the package, but they did
not want to part with McMichael; they would have preferred
including John Hudek or Turk Wendell. But the Dodgers wanted a
reliever of the caliber of McMichael, and the Mets relented because
they wanted Nomo.
The pitcher has other connections to the Mets besides Piazza and
Yoshii. Dave Wallace, who is a senior adviser to General Manager
Steve Phillips, had been the Dodgers' pitching coach. In addition,
Manager Bobby Valentine managed in Japan, though that was in 1995,
the year after Nomo's last as a pitcher in Japan.
Fleming, who last year co-sponsored with Mayor Richard Riordan
the measure that created an elected Charter Reform Commission and
recently helped fund a poll on Valley secession, warned that
failure to take dramatic action could lead to the breakup of the
city.
His charter proposal, announced Thursday, would preserve Los
Angeles as a city by having each of the 15 elected district boards
send its mayor -- the City Council member under the current system
-- and several representatives to a 50-member Metropolitan Council
that would decide citywide issues such as harbor, airport,
utilities, police and fire services.
Members of the district boards and Metropolitan Council would
serve on a part-time basis and be paid about $100 a meeting.
