Ginsburg has said that Ms. Lewinsky would eventually have no
choice but to write a book or sell her story in order to pay off
her legal bills. But no one has approached her or her family with
any such offer recently. And any tell-all deal would certainly have
to wait until Ms. Lewinsky was out of legal jeopardy, a prospect
probably months away at the very least, if not years.
In part to minimize her legal expenses, Ms. Lewinsky did filing
and other routine office chores for Ginsburg and Speights. But this
was as much to fill her time as to make a dent in her debts.
As the subject of intense public scrutiny, Ms. Lewinsky can't do
much of anything these days, in terms of producing income or
otherwise, except to meet with her lawyers or stay secluded with
one of her parents. When she goes out in public, a fleet of TV
cameras is almost always in tow. Several weeks ago, a camera crew
staked out a bank branch near Speights' office in downtown
Washington, where Ms. Lewinsky had been using a cash machine.
In part to lift her sagging spirits, Ms. Lewinsky recently posed
in Malibu for a photo spread in Vanity Fair magazine. But according
to a spokeswoman for the magazine, Ms. Lewinsky wasn't paid
anything. And although she got to model some spiffy clothes, she
didn't get to keep them.
On the other hand, her high-profile dinners at swank Washington
restaurants with the ubiquitous Ginsburg do not appear to have
added to her legal bills; some of the restaurants may have fed them
gratis in return for the publicity of having such celebrated
guests.
Ms. Lewinsky is hardly alone in worrying about how to pay her
lawyers. After disbanding his legal defense fund, President Clinton
has established a new fund to help pay the more than $5 million he
owes to his lawyers at Williams Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher.
Paula Jones, who sued the president for sexual harassment only
to have her case thrown out of court this year, is in a tussle with
two of her lawyers over $800,000 the lawyers say she owes them. And
a slew of current and former White House aides have amassed
six-figure legal bills as witnesses in Starr's $40 million inquiry.
Of course, the marquee value of representing a client like Ms.
Lewinsky is considerable, and therefore her new lawyers may be
willing to discount their rates or be patient about getting paid.
There could even be lucrative book offers down the road, but last
week they vowed to maintain a lower profile than Ginsburg, by
avoiding the TV talk-show circuit.
And for the time being, at least, the lawyers are under orders
to scrimp where they can. One specific request: no limousines to
see Starr.
PARIS Transportation strikes are an annoying fact of life in
France, yet most people sympathize with the strikers when the
subways shut down or truckers block the highways. After all, truck
drivers and railway workers don't make much money, and employers
seldom penalize workers for not showing up during transit strikes,
so it's easy to wish the strikers well.
