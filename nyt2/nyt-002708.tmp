Zubov, 27, completed his second season with the Stars his
sixth NHL season Friday when the Stars lost in Detroit,
eliminating them from the playoffs in the Western Conference
finals.
A member of the 1994 Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers,
Zubov is among the Stars' top performers and was tied for second in
the NHL this season in points by a defenseman with 57. He was the
Stars' second-leading scorer behind Mike Modano in the playoffs
with nine points in 16 games.
A native of Moscow, Zubov came to the Stars in a 1996 trade with
Pittsburgh. He is under contract for two more seasons.
ELMONT, N.Y. It was difficult to watch a Triple Crown triumph
slip away in the last few yards of a 1 1/2-mile race. Racing fans,
80,162 strong, came out to Belmont Park to see history made
Saturday, and they were denied that experience at the wire.
However, it could have been worse. Instead of losing his Triple
Crown bid on the track, Real Quiet could have lost it in the
stewards' stand, and that would have been truly ugly.
Real Quiet, who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness and was
attempting to become the 12th Triple Crown winner in the Belmont
Stakes, zipped past the eighth pole with a 4-length lead. But it
was not meant to be as Victory Gallop, second in the Derby and
Preakness, closed strongly on him, survived two bumps, the second
of which was more than sufficient to cause a disqualification, and
prevailed by a nose.
Had the photo gone the other way, the stewards said they would
have had to take Real Quiet, the 4-5 favorite, down, depriving him
of the sport's greatest honor and depriving his connections of the
$5 million Triple Crown bonus. Had the three stewards acted,
politics would have intruded on the scene and conspiracy theorists
would have abounded. It was unfortunate for those who appreciate
the sweep of history that Real Quiet was defeated, but he is not
the greatest horse ever to stick his head through a bridle, and it
was better that he lost to Victory Gallop's charge than to the
stewards' votes.
Walden, who is an excellent Kentucky horseman, did an
outstanding job of getting Victory Gallop from the Preakness to the
Belmont in top shape. After the Preakness, Victory Gallop developed
a skin rash, caused by ringworm, and lost weight. But he was
dead-fit for the Belmont.
Baffert trains Silver Charm, who lost the Belmont to Touch Gold
nearing the wire last year, which also cost Baffert the Triple
Crown and his share of the $5 million bonus.
Kent Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet and was outfinished by Gary
Stevens on Victory Gallop, criticized himself for moving too soon
entering the far turn. Frankly, he also was a little wider than he
needed to be, but Baffert refused to rip Desormeaux's ride.
Next for Victory Gallop most likely will be the $1 million
Haskell Invitational, going 1 1/8 miles at Monmouth Aug. 9. Among
his opponents there could be Indian Charlie, another top 3-year-old
trained by Baffert, and Coronado's Quest, the talented colt trained
by Shug McGaughey who won the Riva Ridge Stakes on the Belmont
undercard. Real Quiet might go to the $750,000 Travers Stakes, at a
mile and one-quarter at Saratoga Aug. 29.
