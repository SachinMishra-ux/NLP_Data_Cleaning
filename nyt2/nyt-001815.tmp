A lawyer's first duty is to the client, not to the truth,
because the alternative is terrible. If lawyers refuse to defend
clients whom they suspect to be guilty, then some defendants will
appear in court without a lawyer. If suspects know that lawyers may
desert them, they will not be able to confide in them and so
prepare a good defense.
The right to a fair trial cannot exist without defense lawyers
devoted to the business of defending. It is for judges and juries and prosecutors to worry about truth.
When Starr himself was defending tobacco companies some years
ago, and signing briefs arguing that nicotine might not be
addictive, he seemed to understand that the quest for truth must be
balanced against the rights of defendants.
To be fair to Starr, hunting the Clintons is a soul-destroying
business. The president has used every legal trick available to
slow the prosecutor's progress. He has invoked executive privilege
to shield his staff from subpoenas; he has invoked attorney-client
privilege when that failed.
For the past year, the president has assured voters that scandal
investigations will not distract him from the task of government;
but this week (not for the first time) his lawyers claimed the
opposite, in order to persuade a court to keep the investigators at
bay.
All these frustrations are taking their toll on the prosecutor.
In the end, it is to be hoped, Starr may indeed get to the truth;
if the truth does not get to him first. (To publish this insightful 1,050-word article, it must be

Kenneth Starr is out to get the truth about Bill Clinton. He
wants the truth about a 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater. He
wants the truth about a 24-year-old lady called Monica Lewinsky.
To get that truth, Starr has done most things short of cracking
kneecaps. He has hidden a microphone on an accomplice. He has
subpoenaed bookshop records to see what Lewinsky might be reading.
He has allowed a witness who refused to talk to be kept in jail for
nearly two years.
Starr, having won a legal battle over the right to require
Sidney Blumenthal, a presidential aide, to testify, filed a brief
with the Supreme Court, urging that he be let loose on various
other members of the White House staff, including Secret
Servicemen, who have never yet had to divulge the content of
private presidential conversations. No matter: the truth must out.
Those were the headlines. But, on June 1, Starr also gave a
speech to a bar association in North Carolina, in which he expanded
on his passion for the truth at some length.
