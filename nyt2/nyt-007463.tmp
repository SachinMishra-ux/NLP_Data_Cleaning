When the wounded Havrum returned from the battlefront, Helen
Havrum was waiting. They had married in 1943, before he went to
war. He was 17 and she was 16.
Elzie Havrum worked as a laborer and lift operator at a brick
factory in Fulton for almost 40 years and also ran an auction
business out of a barn behind his house.
But when he was buried that day, it was not for the last time.
In January 1993, two FBI agents called on Helen Havrum and asked
her to sign forms permitting them to exhume her husband's body as
part of an investigation of deaths at Ward Four East.
The exhumation in March reminded Havrum of that sorrowful night
nine months earlier when she saw her husband alive for the last
time.
Elzie Havrum had been sick often. Years of smoking when he was
younger and many more years of working in the dusty brick factory
contributed to bouts of asthma and emphysema.
On the morning of June 14, Elzie Havrum told his wife he needed
to go to the hospital because he couldn't catch his breath. He had
spent three days there a week earlier for similar problems.
By evening, he was in a hospital room sitting up, eating and
talking to visitors, his wife recalled.
About 11:30 p.m., Havrum received two Tylenol 3 tablets, which
contain codeine, for his bad back. Helen Havrum stayed with him
until about midnight and then went home.
