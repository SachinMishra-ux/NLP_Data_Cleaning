Gordon began racing on Go-Kart tracks in Vallejo, Calif., when
he was 5 years old. He immediately showed exceptional ability and
an intense drive to win. When he was 13, Gordon's stepfather, John
Bickford, an auto-parts manufacturer, moved the family to Indiana,
where Gordon had the chance to race professionally as a teen-ager.
After years of dominating the Indiana dirt tracks, at the
relatively young age of 21, Gordon made the jump to NASCAR.
For Gordon, who is credited with an otherworldly kind of
aggressive precision as a driver, the timing of his arrival was
perfect. He entered NASCAR as it was beginning to establish itself
as a mainstream sport. At the time, NASCAR was expanding its
schedule and its national television deal with major and cable
networks was relatively new. Also, several new race tracks were
being built.
Attendance at NASCAR events leaped 60 percent from 1990 to 1995,
and its purses now can exceed $5 million for a single race.
NASCAR's marketing staff, too, has got much savvier about selling
the sport, a development that has led to the establishment of theme
restaurants and merchandising outlets in malls across the country.
Gordon, riding the front of the sport's new wave, won eight
races in 1995, his second full year, and 10 more in 1996.
Last year, he became only the second driver to win the $1
million bonus awarded to any racer who wins three of NASCAR's most
prestigious events.
In defense of their heroes, Gordon's army of detractors has
mounted an array of assaults: anti-Jeff Gordon T-shirts and signs
that carry similar messages. Internet home pages such as NASCAR
Fans Against Jeff Gordon (there were 10 such home pages at last
count) carry caricatures and musings that run from the profane to
the absurd to the silly.
While Gordon has his own sizable following he boasts a fan
club of more than 20,000 members there seem to be many more fans
who find satisfaction in rooting against him. Like the drivers,
they, too, are frustrated by Gordon's weekly dominance. And when he
was passed last week in Michigan, the fans roared as loudly as the
fans at Richmond after his wreck there.
In the 1970s, Waltrip was a brash young driver who openly
challenged anyone to beat him. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it was
Earnhardt and Elliott's quick rise to prominence that led to
resentment. But however much people disliked their steady success,
the drivers were always considered authentic members of racing's
rowdy fraternity. And no one then was making the kind of money
Gordon is now: he has earned roughly $15 million in purses in his
career, slightly more than $1 million this year alone.
Gordon said the boos are part of the high price of success. As,
too, are the tactics of the other drivers. Gordon, who stops short
of accusing other drivers of willfully trying to harm him or his
chances, does note that other drivers, even when it might be to
their advantage, almost never join him in the draft.
