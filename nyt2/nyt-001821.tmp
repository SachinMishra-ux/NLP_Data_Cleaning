As for Yarrow Brae, who will start in the 12th hole at Belmont,
Lukas had hoped the Illinois Derby winner would have a monopoly on
early speed and steal a win. But that hope was diminished by the
unexpected entry Thursday of the front-running Flamingo Stakes
winner Chilito.
It is one of thousands of recently established fundamentalist
Christian schools across America, with a mission to major in Jesus
Christ and minor in everything else.
Grace is housed in a small white clapboard schoolhouse beside a
dried-up creek in Mason, a pretty ranching town of 2,100 people.
Step inside, and it is immediately clear that this is a
different kind of school, with humble resources. Desks line the
main room. Teenagers sit next to small children. The atmosphere is
attentive. There are no classrooms as such, just a single teacher
and two teaching assistants walking up and down.
Grace has 35 children, aged 6 to 18. Its largest-ever graduating
class was three; but in recent years its graduates have gone on to
West Point and Texas AM University, among others.
Because most of these schools do not report to the local
educational authorities, exact numbers are difficult to come by;
but Christian Schools International, one of several umbrella
organizations, claims about 3,200 member schools in the United
States, with 600,000 pupils.
The chief reason for their growth is frustration at the removal
of God from the public schools. But some parents have in general
lost confidence in the state's ability to educate their children,
and others question the government's right to dictate educational
standards.
When is a Christian school a fundamentalist school? There are no
hard-and-fast rules; but an unequivocal belief in creationism is
probably the most reliable indicator.
Parents pay around $125 per child each year for books and course
materials. Some of these courses, such as grammar, are laudable for
their basic approach.
Larger fundamentalist schools charge fees and grant
scholarships, but smaller ones have a different approach. Grace is
typical. Its shoestring budget allows it to educate each child for
roughly $1,000 a year.
