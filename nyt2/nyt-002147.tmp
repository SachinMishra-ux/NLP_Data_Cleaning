As for savings, the magnitude isn't as important as the way the
resources are used. Thailand, South Korea and Japan all have much
higher rates of saving than America, for instance, but those
countries are a mess. One reason for the Asian economic turmoil is
that much of the savings were squandered on ill-advised
investments. It doesn't matter how much a society saves if the
money isn't transformed into sound wealth-creating investment.
This is something else for the summiteers in Washington to keep
in mind. The masses who provided savings in Asia were essentially
betrayed by their political and business leaders. Now they have the
worst of all worlds: diminished prosperity and increasingly
doubtful prospects for comfortable retirements.
Body and drive combinations are numerous: There are regular and
extended-cab models in short- and long-bed versions, both with the
standard bed and the step-side bed and in two- or four-wheel
drive. They also come with varying suspensions, from a smooth
on-road configuration to a tough off-road one.
The Chevy trucks come in three trim levels: base, midlevel LS
and uplevel LT. Leather seats are available in Chevy and GMC
models, as are front bucket seats.
I've driven most of the new trucks, in both the GMC and Chevy
versions, including the four-wheel-drive models with the sporty
Z-71 off-road package. I put one of those to the test on a rugged
dirt road from Oracle, Ariz., to the top of Mount Lemmon, near
Tucson, and found the optional AutoTrac automatic four-wheel-drive
system to be convenient for on- and off-road use. The system
engages the front axle whenever the rear wheels begin to spin,
automatically transferring power up front.
These trucks also can be easily equipped for serious
trailer-towing. The Silverado's Z82 trailering package makes it the
most trailer-ready pickup on the market, Chevy says. It includes
plug-ins for trailer lights and electric brakes. And a tow/haul
mode in the automatic transmission changes the vehicle's shift
patterns to improve performance while towing. There's a button at
the end of the gearshift lever to switch the transmission into
towing mode.
The cabs are comfortable, and there's room for six adults with
three abreast in front and rear. Road and wind noise are
surprisingly light for a truck.
I couldn't find anything bad to say about these trucks, except
that there is no four-door extended-cab model planned. That could
drive some sales to the Dodge Ram Quad-Cab. Overall performance,
however, outshines that of the Ford and the Dodge, and only the
Ram's V-10 engine has more power than the best of the Gms.
Those of you concerned about the environment might like to know
that all of these trucks' plastic parts are recyclable. There are
44 pounds less scrap metal produced in the manufacture of each
truck that in the current model.
The Package: Full-size, two- or three-door,
two-to-six-passenger, V-6 or V-8 powered, rear- or four-wheel-drive
pickup truck, an all-new replacement for the C/K models; also
available in GMC version, called the Sierra.
