A less worshipful listener heard something else: a singer with
an out-of-tune croak enthusiastically working her way through two
decades' of dewy-eyed narcissism.
More came across as rambling adolescent diary entries. But as
long as her audience wants to believe, she can still play at being
a princess.
A permanent presidential council would bring sustaining power to
race matters and make it harder for future presidents to disband
the panel without being accused of abandoning the goal of racial
harmony, said the Rev. Suzan D. Johnson Cook, a board member from
New York.
The seven-member advisory board, appointed a year ago by
Clinton, is completing recommendations to help the president
identify ways to promote racial harmony and equal opportunity. The
board's final recommendations will be turned over to Clinton before
its one-year charter expires Sept. 30.
At its final meeting Thursday, the board discussed a number of
ideas, including increasing spending on school construction,
boosting the minimum wage and promoting multi-lingualism as a way
to counter calls to make English the official language.
Some of those ideas may make their way into a report that
Clinton will issue this winter. That report will outline not only
the president's vision but also a work plan for the public and
private sectors to help equalize opportunities across the race
spectrum.
To that end, former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean, a
Republican, said Clinton should seek far more than the $5 billion
over five years for school construction contained in his fiscal
1999 budget.
Without providing a figure, he suggested that additional federal
funding for school construction be explored for urban and rural
school districts in high-poverty areas and that those funds be
matched by the states. He also suggested that the federal
government work with higher education institutions to better
prepare teachers. Kean said Clinton should find a way to ensure
that academic tracking, for placing students according to test
scores, does not result in the resegregation of classrooms.
Other suggestions were that Clinton seek an unspecified minimum
wage increase to boost the income of low-wage workers who are
disproportionately minorities, support collective bargaining to
ensure greater equality of pay, and strengthen enforcement of
anti-discrimination laws, all steps that Clinton has already begun
to take.
Board members said Clinton should urge the media, particularly
television networks, to improve the portrayal of minorities. Board
member Oh suggested that Clinton should encourage English-speaking
Americans to learn another language to help reduce hostilities
against immigrants.
