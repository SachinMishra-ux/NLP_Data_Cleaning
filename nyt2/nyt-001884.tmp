Word of the filing came as no surprise to Planned Parenthood of
Mid-Missouri and Eastern Kansas.
The new law also requires detailed reporting of abortions to the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Tiller argued that
such a requirement could violate the self-incrimination provisions
of the U.S. Constitution.
That could occur, the lawsuit said, if he performed abortions he
believed to be legal and completed reports on them, and then they
were ruled illegal and he was prosecuted. The records could be used
against him.
In another area, Tiller said the law was so restrictive in cases
of medical emergency that a doctor could not act quickly to perform
an abortion when the fetus was viable if the woman's life was in
danger.
The lawsuit does not challenge a portion of the law that bans a
procedure often referred to as partial-birth abortion.
Gittrich argued that the bill took steps toward reducing the
number of late-term abortions performed on Kansas women as well as
those who traveled to the state specifically for the procedure.
NEW YORK Two weeks after the New York Mets acquired Mike
Piazza from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they reunited him on Thursday
night with one of the pitchers he caught every five days, Hideo
Nomo.
Four days after they designated Nomo for assignment following
his request to be traded, the Dodgers shipped the Japanese
right-hander to the Mets along with reliever Brad Clontz. The Mets
sent the Dodgers Dave Mlicki, their No. 5 starting pitcher, and
reliever Greg McMichael.
Nomo, who had a 2-7 record and a 5.05 earned run average in 12
starts this season, had hoped he would be traded to the Mets.
According to a person familiar with the development, the pitcher's
agent, Don Nomura, told the Dodgers that if they did not traded
Nomo to the Mets, he would go home to Japan.
Besides rejoining Piazza, Nomo becomes a teammate of his best
friend, Masato Yoshii, another of the Mets' starting pitchers. They
will make the Mets the first team in major league history with two
Japanese starting pitchers, and New York will have three, including
the Yankees' Hideki Irabu.
