A union representing 30 percent of the engineers for the state
railway network called a strike to begin on the eve of the Cup
opening. Conductors struck and disrupted rail traffic around the
country Friday. Public transportation in Lyons, where five games
will be played, was shut down by a strike Tuesday, and workers on
the Paris municipal transportation system threatened another for
this week.
But it was the pilots who bore the brunt of public resentment.
The French are notoriously suspicious of people who are better
off than they are, to the point of making anonymous telephone calls
to Finance Ministry inspectors to tip them off to people with
lavish life styles (one reason why owners of luxury homes in Paris
often hide them behind dilapidated building facades).
So it was difficult to muster much sympathy for the well-paid
pilots, who after all were not striking for better wages but
demanding cash instead of stock options as part of their salaries
when Air France is partly privatized later this year.
The airline said it needed to cut its annual payroll by $84
million to make itself more competitive in the European market, but
many French regard the stock market as a sort of untrustworthy
gambling casino. As elsewhere in Europe, there is great resistance
here to the idea of supplementing state pensions with the private
investment plans that make union pension funds such big players in
the stock market in America.
WASHINGTON Niccolo Machiavelli had it right: never assume the
other guy will never do something you would never do. Too bad
Machiavelli never worked for the CIA.
The world might be less dangerous than it is today had the CIA
and its sister intelligence services foreseen India's nuclear tests
last month. Armed with that foresight, the United States might have
been able to forestall a test, as it did back in 1995, and thus
prevent an arms race in one of the planet's least pacific places.
A report last week by retired Adm. David Jeremiah, a former vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, blamed the failure on
systemic flaws in the way the intelligence community gathers and
handles information, trains its thousands of analysts and commands
its $27-billion-a-year empire.
Instead, he said, U.S. analysts decided that the newly elected
Hindu nationalist political party, the BJP, couldn't possibly be
serious when it campaigned on a nuclear weapons platform.
Westerners saw good reasons for India to eschew testing and
therefore thought Indians must understand their own best interests
the same way.
Failing to follow such counsel led the United States to believe
that Japan would never attack Pearl Harbor and that Saddam Hussein
would never invade Kuwait.
