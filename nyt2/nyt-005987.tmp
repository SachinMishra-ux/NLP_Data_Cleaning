Though he has had a distinguished 15-year career, Yzerman didn't
achieve a great deal of recognition until last year. Ironically,
that recognition comes as his offensive numbers are diminishing.
After being strictly an offensive gun from 1987-88 through 1992-93 when he had more than 100 points each season Yzerman has become
a strong, dependable two-way player.
This year he had 69 points in the regular season, 24 of them
goals. In the playoffs, which concluded Tuesday when Detroit
finished its sweep of the Washington Capitals, Yzerman had 6 goals
and 24 points in 22 games.
Yzerman, like Bruins captain Ray Bourque, would like to have a
career that spans 20 years.
On a night when the leaderboard changed at the top of the
American League West, the bottom stayed the same. The Anaheim
Angels took over first place ahead of the Texas Rangers and buried
the Mariners a little deeper in the basement with a 3-2 victory
before 27,952 fans at Edison Field.
Swift, the Mariner staff leader in wins with six, absorbed the
most pain in Seattle's ninth loss in 12 games against
California-based teams, suffering a bruised right pectoral muscle
when clobbered by a line drive in the second inning. Although his
status is listed as day-to-day, the veteran sounded as though his
next turn is in jeopardy.
Tuesday night, Angels second baseman Justin Baughman hit a line
drive up the middle and Swift barely had time to react. He ducked,
turned his head and put his glove up for protection. The ball hit
the right side of Swift's chest.
The stunned pitcher retrieved the ball between the mound and
first base, underhanded a throw to Segui and continued toward the
Mariner dugout, being met by manager Lou Piniella and trainer Rick
Griffin.
Swift shrugged off the pain, returned to the mound and finished
the inning. But after watching the right-hander throw several
warmup tosses before the third inning, Piniella went to the mound,
put his arm around Swift's shoulders and made a pitching change.
Swift said he tried to continue, but he could feel tightness
developing and returned to the clubhouse for treatment.
As poorly as the Mariners have played defense this season, Segui
was the exception. He had no errors through the first 69 games.
