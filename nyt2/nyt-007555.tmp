SAN FRANCISCO Ho hum, another U.S. Open, another final-day,
final-group pairing. For Tom Lehman it's getting to be as
predictable as the contents of all those long, wrapped, rectangular
boxes that so many dear old dads will be tearing open today.
A tie for Father's Day? If you're Lehman, you're thinking:
Please, no, not another one like the tie for second in 1996. And,
for that matter, no more solo third-place finishes, either, like in
1995 and 1997.
Lehman has gone into the final round of the U.S. Open with the
lead each of the last three years and lost. He has seen one of the
four greatest gifts in professional golf slip through his fingers.
The title eluded him by three shots in 1995, by one shot in 1996
and by two shots last year.
The snakebit 1996 British Open champion heads into today's final
round tied for second with Bob Tway after equaling the low score of
the third round Saturday with a 2-under-par 68.
This time the pole position and all the pressure belong to
Lehman's playing partner Payne Stewart. He opened Saturday with an
eagle-3, closed it with three straight pars and in between took
whatever the Olympic Club's stingy Lake Course would give him to
tack on a 70 to his earlier rounds of 66 and 71. His 54-hole total
of 207 is four better than Lehman and Tway, who shot a 73.
Nick Price followed a second-round 68 with a 71 to stand tied
for fourth with Lee Janzen (73). It made for some leaderboard as
all four of the players directly behind Stewart Lehman, Tway,
Price and Janzen have won a major.
Then there's Jim Furyk, who has come oh-so-close to winning his
first Grand Slam title, finishing no worse than sixth in the past
four majors. He carded a 68, same as Lehman, and is eight shots
back, at 215.
Like Lehman, Stewart is treading in familiar territory. He led
after three rounds of the 1991 U.S. Open at Hazeltine National Golf
Club in Lehman's home state of Minnesota. The experience ended well
for Stewart, albeit belatedly, as he defeated Scott Simpson in a
Monday playoff.
Since lassoing his first-and-only major, Stewart, 41, has won
only once on the PGA Tour (the 1995 Houston Open). He is the first
to admit his priorities have changed over the past few years, with
family supplanting golf as his abiding passion.
He has trimmed his tournament schedule to make time for his two
children, Chelsea, 12, and Aaron, 9. Stewart wants to be there for
them, as much as he can, just as his late father was for him.
