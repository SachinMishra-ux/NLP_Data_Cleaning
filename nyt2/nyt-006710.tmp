For Correll, who is both chairman of the Atlanta chamber and CEO
of Georgia-Pacific, the question was especially timely. Only that
morning, Correll and the chamber unveiled plans for a six-month
effort to come up with an action plan to address the metro area's
transportation and air quality problems.
The chamber is stepping head-on into an issue that has paralyzed
the community. Despite months of studies and meetings, various
state or regional entities haven't been able to fashion a
resounding consensus on this complex and politically volatile
issue.
The chamber hopes to be the catalyst, as it has in the past when
economic well-being hangs in the balance.
Sensing a need for leadership on the issue, the Atlanta chamber
started pushing forward an idea of an influential group of the key
players from both business and government. The prime movers were
Correll and Atlanta Chamber President Sam A. Williams, who was not
present at his chamber board meeting Thursday because of the death
of his 94-year-old father.
The chamber's initiative could fill a vacuum that has existed
for months, if not years.
Metro Atlanta's transportation problems have not been a state
priority, and looming elections don't help. Gov. Zell Miller has
put off much of the issue to the next governor, and other key
offices, such as lieutenant governor, also are on the verge of
transition.
The Atlanta Regional Commission has tried to address the issue
on a metrowide basis, but it lacks the muscle to get its
recommendations sanctioned by state officials or respected by local
developers or government officials. The Regional Business
Coalition, which has been studying the air quality issue, also has
shied away from bringing state agencies to the table to discuss
their differences.
The Journal article, a summary of long commute times, air
quality problems and even incidents of road rage, shows the world
is beginning to take notice. And that, as much as anything, may
prod leaders to take a stand.
When no other group emerged to lead on this issue, Williams and
Correll drafted the respected consulting firm of McKinsey Co. to
help distill problems and solutions through the group named
Thursday. They also met two or three times with Miller in the past
six weeks.
While the governor has kept a low public profile on the issue,
Correll credited him with providing sound advice on how the chamber
should form the group and ensure it produces action.
