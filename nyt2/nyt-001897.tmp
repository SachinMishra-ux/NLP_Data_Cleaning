And so ended the Sabres' Cinderella run in the spring of '98.
Although backed by Hasek, considered the best goalie in the world,
the young Sabres ultimately could not match the Capitals' veteran
touch around the net as they lost the best-of-seven series, 4-2.
And Hasek was slightly outplayed by Olaf Kolzig, who turned back 39
shots Thursday night in leading the Caps to the finals for the
first time in their 24-year history.
The Caps will visit the winner of the Western Conference finals Dallas or Detroit in Game 1 Tuesday. Game 2 will be Thursday,
followed by Games 3 and 4 in Washington the following Saturday and
Tuesday.
Thursday Washington coach Ron Wilson captured his club's
imagination by asking his players to focus on the accomplishments
of Apollo 11.
The one giant leap for the Caps came on a neutral-zone turnover
by Buffalo defenseman Darryl Shannon. Oates took possession outside
the blue line, fed Bellows, and the rest was in the hands of
Mission Control.
The Sabres appeared to have a date for Game 7 set in the third
period when Paul Kruse used one of his skates to knock in a Bob
Boughner slapper. Fighting for position down low in the slot, Kruse
couldn't have seen Boughner's steamer tick off his boot and slip
past Kolzig for the 2-1 lead. Thousands of white pom-poms in the
crowd were raised in celebration, looking like ghosts of playoffs
past for the Caps, who three times in their history lost series
after taking 3-1 leads.
With 5:59 remaining in regulation, the persistent Caps tied it,
2-2, when Peter Bondra redirected Andrei Nikolishin's pass from the
right wing board. It turned out to be the end for the Sabres, a
plucky bunch of kids who rallied around Hasek, their Olympic
gold-medal goalie, and came within six victories of a Cup.
The Caps now have four days to rest their aged bones and prepare
for the finals. Too old and too tattered to get to where they're
going, they could be trooping the Stanley Cup down Pennsylvania
Avenue in a couple of weeks.
In the meantime, Wilson can work on his next theme, maybe
something with William Shattner or Leonard Nimoy. The Caps have
shown there is a whole universe of possibilities.
Nomo, designated for assignment Monday after demanding the
Dodgers trade him, was sent to the New York Mets in a four-player
deal that was completed after O'Malley assured the pitcher he would
not be sent to a team against his wishes.
The trade reunites Nomo with former pitching coach Dave Wallace
and catcher Mike Piazza. Mets starter Masato Yoshii was a former
teammate with the Kintetsu Buffaloes and New York manager Bobby
Valentine managed one season in Japan.
