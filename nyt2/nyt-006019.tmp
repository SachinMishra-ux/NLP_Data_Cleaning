But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
