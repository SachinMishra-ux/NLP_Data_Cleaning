WASHINGTON President Clinton and congressional leaders from
both parties jockeyed Thursday for political advantage from the
Senate's votes Wednesday night to shelve comprehensive tobacco
legislation.
Without offering many details, House Speaker Newt Gingrich said
that he would put forward next week a low-budget alternative to the
Senate bill, a measure that would be tightly focused on
discouraging teen-agers from smoking. Gingrich said the bill would
go before the House for a vote in July.
The Senate bill would have raised the price of cigarettes by at
least $1.10 a package over five years, allowed the Food and Drug
Administration to regulate cigarette advertising and marketing and
forced the tobacco companies to pay stiff penalties if the level of
teen-age smoking did not fall to specified levels.
