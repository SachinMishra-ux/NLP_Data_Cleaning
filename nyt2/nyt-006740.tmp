Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Co., the second-largest American
investment bank by capital after Merrill Lynch Co., said earnings
for the period ended May 31 jumped 45 percent, compared with a year
ago, to $854 million, or $1.37 a fully diluted share. Lehman
Brothers Holdings, the fourth-largest brokerage firm, said earnings
rose 168 percent from a year earlier, to $324 million, or $2.12 a
share.
Both companies said a blistering pace of mergers and
acquisitions in America and overseas bolstered advisory fees. The
companies also reported sharp increases in equity and debt issues
and trading.
Despite signs that the long-running bull market in stocks may be
slowing, both companies said record backlogs of new debt and equity
issues and ongoing mergers promise continued strong earnings growth
into the second half of the year.
One reason for the sharp gains was the record pace of merger and
acquisition activity. Morgan told Wall Street analysts in a
conference call that the value of deals in which companies bought
other companies totaled $1 trillion in the first half of this year.
Companies also sold nearly half a trillion dollars in securities
during the first half. Both figures were records.
Both companies benefited from a strong international presence.
Even in Asia, where financial markets have plunged, results were
sharply higher. That is because volatility in those markets means a
sharply higher pace of selling and buying, and the brokerage
companies earn their fees based on transaction volume.
Like the United States, Europe has had a strong stock market,
but that market is seen as at an earlier stage in its rally.
Moreover, market activity looks set to increase in the run-up to
European monetary union early next year, with some American
securities companies well placed to benefit from that surge.
Morgan's strong performance comes about one year after the
institutional business of Morgan Stanley merged with the retail
brokerage operations of Dean Witter. Both sides of the business
reported record earnings, Scott, the chief financial officer, said.
At Lehman, which become an independent listed company when it
was spun off by American Express Co. in 1994, this year's second
quarter continued a string of strong growth that has seen its
annual profits rise to $647 million in 1997 from $113 million in
1994.
WASHINGTON Iraq is smuggling large volumes of oil into Turkey
in violation of U.N. sanctions, U.S. and Turkish officials say.
The officials say the Clinton administration has chosen to look
the other way, aware that the smuggling benefits Turkey, a crucial
ally in the American policy toward Iraq, and Kurds who deny the
Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein control over northern
Iraq.
