In a terse statement Thursday, Selig said that discussion of his
willingness to take the job was premature and that he had not yet
accepted it. An article in The New York Times on Thursday said
Selig had decided to accept the position full time.
Owners and officials throughout baseball said Wednesday, and
others confirmed Thursday, that Selig had responded to a large
group of owners who want him to be commissioner by signaling his
intention to accept the job.
Major league rules stipulate that a vote for commissioner has to
be done with a written ballot. Since the owners' next quarterly
meeting is not until September, Selig is expected to call a special
meeting to hold the election. He has to give the owners 10 days'
notice.
If Selig had decided not to accept the job, Jerry McMorris of
the Colorado Rockies, the search committee chairman, would have
presented four candidates to the ruling executive council,
according to one official close to the commissioner search.
National League president Leonard Coleman was the only one of the
four who is already in baseball. The official did not identify the
three people outside baseball.
McMorris declined to comment on the candidates. He also declined
to discuss Selig as commissioner because, he said, the Milwaukee
Brewers' owner has not told him he wants the job.
Because Selig owns one of the teams he would be overseeing, he
is expected to take some action regarding the Brewers. The most
likely option is that he would put his share of the team into a
trust.
This is the second search since Fay Vincent resigned as
commissioner in September 1992 that has ended without a candidate
other than Selig being considered by the executive council.
The Democrats plan to pound the Republicans on the smoking issue
through the November elections, arguing that they are doing the
bidding of the tobacco industry.
And the Republican leadership will buck any attempt to resurrect
the $516 billion anti-smoking legislation that would have raised
cigarette prices by a $1.10 a pack.
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga, said a plan to be debated
next month would likely include an anti-smoking advertising
campaign and provide incentives to states to discourage teen-age
smoking, such as denying driver's licenses to underage smokers.
