There is something peculiarly American about the trap of
mirror-imaging. Americans overseas like foreigners to speak, dress,
eat and entertain as Americans do. They may well believe that
everybody also thinks as they do. The whole world buys Big Macs so the ideas must come along with them, like a side of fries. This
way of thinking meant that, last month, the United States
government looked down at India from its spy satellites and saw
the United States.
What does this say about the state of U.S. intelligence? First,
mirror-imaging filled a void. America had few or no spies in India
reporting on the nuclear program. So its analysts had to think
without the benefit of facts.
In its defense, the CIA was not the only outfit in Washington
that had a mirror where its crystal ball should be. So had the
White House, the Pentagon and the State Department.
The agency's reporting on Pakistan's subsequent nuclear tests
was prescient and precise. But Jeremiah found the CIA misread
India's nuclear ambitions because it was short on insight,
expertise, training and leadership a strange state of affairs for
an intelligence agency created to be the deepest think tank in the
world.
David Cone, the New York Yankees right-hander, was nipped on the
index finger of his pitching hand by his mother's dog and had to
yield his turn in the pitching rotation to Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez, newly defected from Cuba. Thus a minor bite by a Jack
Russell terrier named Veronica facilitated the storybook odyssey of
a gifted pitcher, from ostracism in his Communist homeland to a
victorious debut in Yankee Stadium on Wednesday night.
Developments on the dog-bite front aren't usually so uplifting.
That was also clear last week for in case you didn't notice (and
it's a good bet David Cone didn't) it was National Dog Bite
Prevention Week.
The sponsors, the U.S. Postal Service and the Humane Society of
the United States, say that each day man's best friend chomps down
on 12,000 Americans mostly children, but also 7 postal employees
daily on average for a total of more than 4 million dog bites
annually. The cost? Ouch: hundreds of millions of dollars annually
in medical bills and liability claims.
The close association between humans and domesticated dogs began
at least 12,000 years ago. Since then, people have been intimately
involved in domesticating the wild dog into hunter, guard and
companion. However, the domesticated dog retains many of its wild
instincts, including behaviors that all too often lead to human
attacks. This risk has always been present. Only now, however, are
we beginning to gain a full understanding of the impact of dog
bites on populations.
Recent work by Sacks et al has improved the precision of
national estimates for dog bite-related mortality and for dog bites
receiving any medical attention. For the 10-year period 1979
through 1988, an annual average of about 15 fatal dog attacks was
documented in the United States, with extrapolated estimates
suggesting that as many as 20 per year may have actually occurred.
Based on a random household survey, the Injury Control and Risk
Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it was estimated that about 800,000 bites occur annually that
require medical attention.
(BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Of course, there are many minor bites that
go without medical attention. But by sifting national data on
emergency-room visits, the researchers were able to focus on the
most serious injuries:(END ITALICS HERE)
