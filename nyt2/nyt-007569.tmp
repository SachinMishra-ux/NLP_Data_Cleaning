Win, lose or honorable tie, U.S. players plan to shake hands
with the Iranians afterward. Several said they hope to exchange
gifts.
Seven years later, as the draft returns to upstate New York,
another physical center with Lindros-like proportions has emerged
as hockey's most coveted choice.
In 58 games last season for Rimouski Oceananic in the Quebec
junior league, Lecavalier racked up 44 goals and 115 points along
with 117 penalty minutes. Central Scouting gave him grades of 10s
in hockey sense and puck-handling, nine in competitiveness, and
eights in skating, checking and physical play.
Lesuk and the Coyotes would love to have him. But Lecavalier
will be long gone by the time Phoenix makes its first pick with the
14th overall selection.
Unless the Coyotes make their third major trade in two weeks, of
course, and ship out yet another core player for the rights to the
shining, can't-miss 18-year-old. The team recently traded top-line
center Craig Janney and popular enforcer Jim McKenzie. But don't
count on seeing Lecavalier in a Coyotes sweater.
As sure as Joe Thornton was bound for Boston as last year's
consensus No. 1 pick, Lecavalier is headed for Tampa Bay, which
maneuvered itself into grabbing the first pick after it changed
hands from Florida to San Jose.
The Panthers gave it to the Sharks last November for Viktor
Kozlov. Originally the No. 3 pick at the time, it became the No. 1
pick when San Jose won the draft lottery in May. The Sharks,
though, sent it to the Lightning, in part, for Bryan Marchment.
San Jose will still make out on Saturday. The Sharks hold the
No. 2 pick and will be overjoyed at drafting the other top center
in the field, David Legwand of Gross Pointe, Mich., if Lecavalier
goes to Tampa as expected. Legwand, who is 6-1{ and 175 pounds,
scored 10 more goals than Lecavalier did last season, netting 54
and 105 points for Plymouth in the Ontario League.
Many scouts have the two rated evenly. Central Scouting gave
Legwand 10s in skating, hockey sense and puckhandling and an eight
in competitiveness. He drew only sixes in checking and physical
play, but he's being compared to Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars,
the No. 1 pick in the 1988 draft.
One scout said Legwand will be a franchise player and
consistently rank among the NHL's top 10 in scoring by the time he
is 24. Others have made similar remarks, which doesn't sit well
with Lecavalier.
