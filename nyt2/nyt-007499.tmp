Woodward says she wants to attend college and then get a job.
LeFave said she'd been there, too. She had a steady job as an
airline reservations clerk two years ago until a supervisor saw
her on the 6 o'clock news. LeFave was immediately escorted from the
premises.
 Then again, some say that like a fading athlete grown addicted
to glory, Woodward may miss the constant media attention: cameras
flashing and reporters jostling to get closer to her.
British journalists said last week that although they will soon
leave town, they will return to document Woodward's most personal
milestones: her start in college, her first job, her love
relationships and, especially, the birth of a first child.
On Tuesday, minutes after she left Marblehead for Logan Airport
and the flight home to Elton, media trucks and journalists
descended on the English town. Some villagers complained, and
others even crossed the street to avoid reporters. But Barlow noted
that still others have come to realize how vital publicity has
been a help to Woodward, at least financially.
Left alone, Woodward will probably suffer internal conflicts
between her belief that she's innocent and her court conviction,
British psychologists say.
Dr. Sidney Crown, a London psychotherapist, believes the
Woodward family should undergo counseling as Louise tries to regain
her life.
Woodward's challenge to adjust will be complicated by the fickle
press, said Dr. Richard Howells, a communications instructor at the
University of Leeds.
In November, when Judge Hiller Zobel reduced Woodward's
second-degree murder conviction to manslaughter and sentenced her
to the 279 days she had already served, the village of Elton
toasted Woodward with champagne, hailing her as a folk hero who'd
survived rough treatment in a foreign land.
But as she finally arrived here last week traveling like
royalty despite unresolved allegations that her family misused her
defense fund public opinion on British soil had already shifted.
Howell said Woodward's upcoming interview with the BBC's Martin
Bashir may swing the public pendulum back to Woodward, if all goes
well and, experts added, as long as she doesn't get paid for her
story.
