Stewart's closest pursuer is Carnevale, a career journeyman who
has bounced between the PGA Tour and Nike Tour in recent seasons.
But the 38-year-old emerged as the only front-runner to finish 18
holes without a bogey in the opening round.
Carnevale, 38, hit 10 of 14 fairways and found 12 of 18 greens
in regulation. He one-putted nine greens, including three for
birdies.
SAN FRANCISCO As they watch him limp, the bitterness wanes. As
they meet the person, the principles soften. And as they witness a
disabled man validating his journey, an amazing thing is happening:
A big divot of compassion is emerging from the pampered fairways of
their soul.
Not now. Not when the man with a dying leg beats the system,
shrugs off the animosity, keeps his head down and completes the
first round of his first major . . . eight strokes off the lead.
The stodgy suits will never admit it, but golf scored big on
Thursday. Four months after winning in court, Martin is poised to
go from role model to folk hero.
After all, this wasn't a freak show or a rebel without a cause.
This is a golfer proving why he deserves to ride. And if you have a
pulse, you are cheering for Martin now.
Why must the lords of golf fight this sentiment? Why can't they
drop the appeal, one that is costing Martin over six figures in
legal fees? How can they cite the sanctity of tradition when they
sell out to club manufacturers?
It's easy to fawn over talent, but what about courage? Isn't
that worth more than anything, a lesson everyone can learn from?
You would think they'd recognize what a boon Martin can be for
their sport.
It was almost cruel what Martin experienced after arriving in
San Francisco. A flat tire on the way to his practice round. A cart
that broke down after one hole, and another single-seat model that
almost tipped over navigating the hills.
Through it all, Martin graciously accepted whatever he was
given, and then his luck began to change.
