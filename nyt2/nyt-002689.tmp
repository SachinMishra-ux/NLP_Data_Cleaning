With no depth either on the big club or down on the farm, the
Mariner skipper simply does not have the pieces necessary to shake
things up.
It only takes one game to start a win streak. A turnaround is
conceivable, but not without some bold intervention.
SEATTLE After suggesting Saturday night that some lineup
changes were in store, Mariner manager Lou Piniella stuck with
basically the same starters Sunday and got a similar result in the
series finale against the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros slugged solo home runs and the
Dodgers blooped losing pitcher Jamie Moyer into submission during a
game-clinching five-run rally in the sixth inning as the Mariners
fell eight games below .500 (27-35) for the first time since ending
the 1994 season with a 49-63 record.
The M's went down with a ninth-inning fight, scoring three runs
and then loading the bases to bring the potential winning run to
the plate. Sore-footed pinch-hitter David Segui struck out.
Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 24th homer in the ninth but otherwise
had an rare dismal game striking out three times and misplaying a
line drive into right-center field for his third error of the
season.
Segui, the only lineup change and only because he has a sore
right foot took three swings against Antonio Osuna, missing all
three.
As they returned to their clubhouse, the Mariners continued to
rub their collective eyes in disbelief. They left 13 more
baserunners on base. And popups fell in front of Griffey and right
fielder Rob Ducey to fuel the Dodgers' big fifth inning.
The Dodgers, who won the final two games of the interleague
series, rode the solid pitching of starter Darren Dreifort for
eight innings. The right-hander, whom the Mariners reportedly
requested in recent trade talks involving Randy Johnson, spaced
nine hits and got a superb defensive play by second baseman Eric
Young, who deprived Edgar Martinez of a run-scoring single in the
third inning.
Seattle was 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position until
Rodriguez singled home Cora from third base in the seventh inning.
