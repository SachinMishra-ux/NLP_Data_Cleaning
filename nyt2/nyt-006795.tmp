Down 2-1, the Braves started the fourth inning with three
straight singles, off the bats of Andres Galarraga, Klesko and Javy
Lopez. Lopez's single up the middle scored Galarraga to tie the
score.
Klesko's aggressiveness, however, caused him to stumble over the
base and fall. When he reached back for third, Florida's Todd Zeile
had his glove and the ball there to meet his fingers.
After the game, Klesko sounded as if he wanted to find a spot
there himself.
He didn't. Lopez's single, the third in a row of the inning,
also was the last of the inning. Michael Tucker followed by forcing
Lopez out at second, and Andruw Jones hit a weak grounder to first
to end the inning.
After Klesko's faux pas, only two more Braves got as far as
second base. And the Marlins' pitchers hushed all possibilities of
another score.
Klesko is batting .418 (18-for-43) with four homers and 13 RBIs
during his hot stretch. But the blunder?
SAN FRANCISCO -- It seemed the sensible thing to do. In the
first place, picking out a player to follow the first round of a
golf tournament is a crapshoot. The chance of picking the player
who might take the lead is even more uncertain than trying to pick
the winner. This U.S. Open started out with 7,117 applications, and
another 136 came in late, out of which 156 would eventually make
the field.
Sixty-seven are exempt. The rest have to go through qualifying.
Larry Mize missed by a stroke. Fred Funk didn't make it. Trevor
Dodds and Steve Pate, Tour winners, had to survive playoffs. Craig
Stadler and Bruce Lietzke refuse to try any longer.
You decide the wise thing to do is pick a guy with a local
background and see how it works out. Stewart Cink has done well in
the U.S. Open, no worse than 16th place, which in 1996 won an
invitation to the Masters. He was paired with Fuzzy Zoeller,
another pleasant fellow to watch, and Retief Goosen, a young South
African who is beginning to make his home on the European Tour.
Cink and Zoeller both birdie the first hole, Cink out of the
heavy stuff twice. Cink goes 2-under par with a birdie on the 5th
hole and follows that with another from about 15 feet on the 6th.
This is looking good. The early leader board is looking good.
Woods, Couples, Montgomerie, Daly and Verplank are up there.
