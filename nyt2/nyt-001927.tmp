But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
WASHINGTON It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
