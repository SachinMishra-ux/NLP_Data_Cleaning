The murder by three white men of Byrd, a happy-go-lucky black
man known in Jasper for singing songs and hitching rides, has
reminded Jasper and the rest of America that relations between
the races are as vexed as ever.
Unlike the rest of Texas, which breaks down along Anglo-Latino
lines, east Texas is almost wholly black-and-white. This is
particularly true of Jasper, which is 55 percent white and 42
percent black.
The knee-jerk reaction of the national media, as the story
broke, was to present east Texas as a white-trash outpost whose
public offices are occupied by closet bigots. In fact, as the
journalists soon discovered, Jasper has a black mayor and a black
school principal.
Even the Black Panthers, who sallied into town for a shameless
publicity session, praised the white sheriff, Billy Rowles, for his
efficient handling of the case. Byrd's family offered unconditional
forgiveness to his white killers.
Many times in the week, militant blacks in town from distant
parts to preach their particular form of racial separatism were
shouted down not by whites but by blacks, who said they abhorred
violence and vengeance. On the surface, outrage and sorrow brought
Jasper together.
The townsfolk were adamant that this awful crime did not
represent them. This was true. What represents the town, and makes
it so typical, is something much more subtle: a thousand small
prejudices and slights that blacks in east Texas feel, but whites
rarely notice.
It bothers blacks in Jasper that the bank-tellers are almost all
white, and that they rarely see a black waitress in the more
expensive local restaurants.
A group of black maids at a local hotel (speaking anonymously
for fear of managerial retribution) were particularly candid. They
felt humiliated, they said, when security people followed them
around the aisles in the Wal-Mart.
Younger blacks were particularly unhappy with Jasper's black
leaders, who, they said, were too deferential to whites. It had
taken the death of Byrd, they claimed, to wake up the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
On Saturday, Byrd's funeral showed the unstated segregation. Of
the 1,000 or so people who attended the service, fewer than 50 were
white.
