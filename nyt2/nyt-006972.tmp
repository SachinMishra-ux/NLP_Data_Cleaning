The overwhelming consensus was that the fellow should go ahead
and get them. Actually, $49.95 is pretty high for a set of Blue
Chips, but I gather this one comes boxed. I'd forgo the box and buy
them cheaper. I can't remember what I paid for mine, but it was
closer to half that price. Of course, that was a long time ago.
Some responders even suggested that anybody who would turn up
his nose at Blue Chip chisels is nothing but a snob.
I would say get the Blue Chips for a couple of reasons: First,
this gentleman is obviously a beginner and they're most adequate
for starters. Second, I know of no other moderately priced set
which includes the invaluable 1/8-inch chisel. And finally, I'd as
soon have the Marples as the Sorby. I don't know how much
difference in price there is between the sets, but I doubt if
there's much difference in quality.
But I wouldn't suggest that anyone who wants a better set is a
snob. He's simply moved to another level of the craft.
I recall some years back Fine Woodworking did one of its rare
(for the time) reviews of tools, and in this case analyzed the
steel in various brands of chisels. The Blue Chips came in last by
a long way. They'll take a fine edge, but they won't necessarily
hold it very long.
There are, generally speaking, no finer chisels than those made
in Japan, although one needs to be careful to buy from a reputable
dealer who will sell a set made for export. Japanese chisels are
made of laminated steel; a thin layer of hard steel on the back for
the edge, with a thicker layer of milder steel to back it up.
In Japan, most woodworkers use soft woods, and thus can use
extremely hard steel. But in this country, where furniture making
nearly always involves hardwoods, such an edge will tend to chip
very easily.
Japanese chisels range from moderately priced to incredibly
expensive. The more expensive ones tend to be works of art rather
than practical tools. A $10 chisel may not hold an edge as long as
I'd like, but a $100 one makes me nervous.
The Record plane is in the same category as the Marples chisels
-- it's hard to find anything else, and even harder to find
anything better. The soles of Record planes are never, in my
experience, flat or square to the sides, and the irons are of
indifferent quality. If you're willing to put in a considerable
degree of scutwork, you can deal with this.
Basically, you'll have to flatten the soles by hand, which means
rubbing them on wet silicon carbide powder or paper on an
absolutely flat surface, usually heavy glass. The soles don't have
to be totally flat, but the leading edge, the surfaces just fore
and aft of the iron, and the tail end should all be on exactly the
same plane. The rest of the surface can be a little lower.
