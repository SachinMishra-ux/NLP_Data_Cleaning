The money was left by Rev. J. Keith Symons, bishop of the Palm
Beach Diocese. He told the troubled man's family it came from his
heart and out of his pocket. The parents told him another priest
had assaulted their son, and Symons said he wanted to help.
As Symons was making the weekly payments, the mother's two sons,
now in their 30s, were giving prosecutors sworn statements in a
lurid sexual molestation case in St. Petersburg.
Rev. Rocco Charles D'Angelo was being accused by five former
altar boys of assaulting them in the 1960s and 1970s. The boys said
in court papers D'Angelo abused them while he was at St. Mark's
Church in Boynton Beach. Records show D'Angelo admitted being a
molester, sometimes assaulting boys while wearing his priestly
vestments.
Symons was the chancellor of the St. Petersburg diocese from
1971-81 when D'Angelo was moved there from Miami. Symons was the
keeper of the paperwork, the official church records. He was the
administrator who admitted receiving a letter describing D'Angelo's
history as a pedophile in South Florida.
Joseph Divito, general counsel to the Diocese of St. Petersburg,
did not return repeated telephone calls Thursday. Symons, church
officials say, is undergoing psychological treatment at an
undisclosed site.
On Tuesday, he resigned as bishop of the Palm Beach diocese,
admitting he like D'Angelo, his subordinate had molested altar
boys decades ago.
Symons' departure comes a week after Sidaway announced he'd
settled a lawsuit against the church in the D'Angelo case. Sidaway
is one of at least eight men who say the priest molested them.
Sidaway sued Symons, the Diocese of Palm Beach and the
Archdiocese of Miami in 1996. In court documents, the church later
admitted to the sexual assaults and to placing D'Angelo in
treatment. The church admitted promising victims' parents the
priest would be sent where he could not bother children; instead,
D'Angelo spent 25 years in the Tampa Bay area.
In November 1975, D'Angelo had been in St. Petersburg for seven
years and wanted his affiliation officially transferred from Miami,
according to church documents.
Symons wrote Archbishop Coleman F. Carroll of Miami; the Miami
chancellor wrote back to Symons' supervisor, the bishop of St.
Petersburg, explaining the circumstances of D'Angelo's departure
from South Florida.
