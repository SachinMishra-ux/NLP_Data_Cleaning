Since then the quiet, modest Lehman has earned more than $5
million in prize money. He also has endorsement contracts that
guarantee him at least $5 million a year for the next five years.
But for many golfers, the Open circle can be the most difficult
to close, because the Open is arguably the most difficult of the
four majors. The rough is too thick, the greens too fast.
Sam Snead never did win the Open, blowing to an 8 on the final
hole at the Spring Mill course of the Philadelphia Country Club in
1939 when all he needed was a par 5. Arnold Palmer streaked to a
final-round 65 to win at Cherry Hills in Denver in 1960, then lost
three 18-hole playoffs. Tom Watson holed a memorable chip-in to win
at Pebble Beach in 1982.
Over the years, Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus share
the Open record with four victories (along with Willie Anderson
nearly a century ago). Proof that Jones, Hogan and Nicklaus were
the best of their respective eras.
But no other recent golfer has had the elusive opportunity to
win the world's most prestigious championship more often than this
big man from Minnesota who now lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., with
Melissa and their three children.
In the past three Opens, he had been paired with Jeff Maggert
last year at Congressional, with Steve Jones at Oakland Hills and
with Greg Norman at Shinnecock Hills.
Some golfers would be tormented by being so close at the Open
and yet so far. Not Lehman.
But now Tom Lehman, who will turn 40 next March, must wait for
next year's Open at Pinehurst, N.C., which he is already thinking
about.
SCHOLARSHIP SCAMS: You can now find advice on how to avoid
college scholarship and financial aid scams at www.finaid.org, the
Website set up by the National Association of Student Financial Aid
Administrators. According to the association, a growing number of
scam artists are preying on parents and students, using such
tactics as hefty application charges and demands for administrative
fees before a mysterious academic prize can be claimed.
RETIREMENT PLANS: Most Americans rely on employers rather than
themselves or Social Security to finance retirement, a new survey
shows. The study, conducted by the nonprofit Certified Financial
Planner Board of Standards, suggests that 67 percent of Americans
depend heavily on employers to fund their golden years, compared
with 10 percent who depend mostly on personal retirement plans and
3 percent who rely on Social Security. The survey, which also lists
the top reasons Americans don't achieve their retirement goals, is
available at www.cfp-board.org.
