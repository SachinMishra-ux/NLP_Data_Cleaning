Park (5-4) gave up a two-run double to Tony Gwynn in the third
inning that tied the game 2-2. It was Gwynn's first start in a week
since straining his left calf.
With the game tied 3-3 in the sixth, Park allowed a two-run
homer to Ken Caminiti. Although the Dodgers scored three runs in
the ninth, they never recovered from Caminiti's home run.
The Dodgers even spotted him a 2-0 lead on home runs by Gary
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi on a rare night when Padres right-hander
Kevin Brown (7-3) did not have his best stuff.
The Padres appeared to blow open the game in the seventh when
former Dodger Carlos Hernandez lined a three-run double into the
left-field corner against Mark Guthrie, who replaced Park after six
innings.
Guthrie allowed a fourth run and all of them were unearned. With
one out, Greg Vaughn grounded to short, but Eric Young did not
touch the bag as he tried to complete a double play.
Second-base umpire Jim Quick ruled the base runner, Caminiti,
was safe. When Hernandez doubled it just seemed like piling on. It
turned out to be a critical play.
Before the game, the Dodgers held a players-only meeting with
hopes of regaining some of the fire lost in back-to-back losses to
Colorado on Saturday and Sunday.
The Dodgers rallied for three runs in the ninth inning against
right-hander Brian Boehringer. Jose Vizcaino singled home two runs
and Sheffield followed with an RBI double. But Trevor Hoffman came
on to get the final out for his 21st save in 21 opportunities, the
only closer in the majors who is perfect this season.
Sheffield continue his hot hitting since joining the club in the
big trade with the Florida Marlins. With three more hits he is
batting .352 (35 for 96) since joining the club.
But Bonilla continues to struggle since his first weekend with
the club. Tuesday, Bonilla went 0 for 4, including an inning-ending
double play in the eighth after the first two batters reached base.
