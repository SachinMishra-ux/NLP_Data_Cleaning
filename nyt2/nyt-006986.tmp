Two-way U.S.-China trade amounted to $157.2 billion last year about eight percent of U.S. trade worldwide. White House officials

economies in the world.
Clinton will emphasize the U.S. economic stakes in trade with
China during his 10-day, five-city visit to China that begins next
Wednesday, McCurry said.
Clinton's visit will be the first by an American president since
Chinese communist authorities cracked down on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, leaving between 400 to
800 dead and hundreds more imprisoned.
McCurry noted America's deepening trade deficit with Asia due to
the inability of faltering Asian economies to import U.S. products
and the ever-cheaper prices of Asian goods in the United States.
Clinton renewed the status on June 3. Congress has 90 days to
vote to disapproval the renewal. The House is expected to take the
initial congressional action on Clinton's request after it returns
from the July 4 recess.
The Commerce Department reported on Thursday that the U.S. trade
deficit soared to $14.5 billion in April a new record for the

the purchase of Japanese yen earlier this week in an effort to stem
the declining value of the Japanese currency, a situation that

PARIS On at least two counts, past experience does not
encourage optimism that America's intervention to prop up the
wilting Japanese yen will prove effective for long.
