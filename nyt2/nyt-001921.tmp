On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.
It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
