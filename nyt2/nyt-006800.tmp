For Bill Wilson, now is the ideal time to sell, says James F.
Wilson (no relation), an analyst with Jefferies Co. in San
Francisco.
After opening at $45.50, Tekelec shares lost as much as $5,
before regaining some ground to close down $4.875 at $40.625. More
than 1 million shares traded hands, nearly four times the issue's
six-month average daily volume.
Thursday's drop came a day after Tekelec officials finished a
road show to New York and Boston to introduce analysts and
investors to the firm's new chief executive officer, Michael
Margolis. Margolis replaced retiring CEO Allan Toomer in February.
Among the issues on which Margolis was queried by investors was
Tekelec's second quarter book-to-bill ratio, a figure that compares
the dollar amount of new orders coming in to existing orders
shipped over a given period. A ratio of 1 means that the amounts
are equal and implies a steady stream of business.
Several analysts have predicted the company's book-to-bill ratio
will drop below 1 for the quarter, though Tekelec has said it
should go down no further than 0.9. That would mean Tekelec is not
getting as many new orders as it's currently filling.
Kevin Slocum, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group, said he
blamed his own comments in part on Tekelec's Thursday dip. In a
daily report published by First Call Corp. and distributed to
analysts and investors, Slocum said some investors were disturbed
by the company's likely ratio. But in an interview Thursday
afternoon, Slocum said he personally is unconcerned by the figure.
Tekelec manufactures and services diagnostic testing equipment
for large computer networks, and network switching equipment used
in the telecommunications industry. The company had 1997 revenues
of $125.2 million and has, as of Thursday's close, a market
capitalization of $1.08 billion. 
It was like listening to a TV evangelist. Let industry standards
into your life, the preacher says, and they'll guide you to
deliverance (not to mention big revenues).
Microsoft held a Hollywood-style party Tuesday night near
Lincoln Center to preview the next version of its Office suite,
called Office 2000. (Obviously, it isn't coming out any time soon.)
Office, in case you don't know, is the software package that
includes Word, Excel, Access and PowerPoint. All will be integrated
so closely with the Web, they'll make Kentucky cousins look like
distinct family lines.
For example, you'll be able to drag elements of a database and
spreadsheet into a Word document and save the finished product in
HTML (the language of the Web) directly to your company's Intranet.
And that's not all. Because the applications are linked, when you
update information in the original document, it also updates
automatically on the Web page.
