There is the usual soccer fanaticism a fan recently scoured
the downtown strip of sports stores buying up 1,000 Iranian jerseys
for friends in the United States. Some universities postponed exams
and people have delayed summer vacations until after the World Cup
Tournament.
But the love of Iranian soccer is better illustrated by impish
nine-year-old Samayeh Hemati. Under the required head scarf and
black cape, there's a soccer fan in blue jeans and sneakers.
She plays with the boys in the street and saves a picture of her
favorite Iranian forward.
Women might be the country's biggest fans, though they cannot
play on organized teams. When the team qualified for the tournament
in December, men and women danced side-by-side in the streets. The
ruling religious Mullahs were nervous, but did not dare try to stop
them.
It had been 20 years since Iran made it to the World Cup. Since
then, Iranians replaced a brutal, American-backed, dictator with a
popular, but stern, Islamic revolution. They stormed the U.S.
Embassy in 1979, holding 52 Americans captive for 444 days. Later,
the Iranians saw one of their airliners shot down by a U.S. Navy
missile.
Last year they surprised the world by electing President
Mohammad Khatami, who promised to loosen the strict religious codes
if he can hold off the more powerful religious conservatives.
When the team qualified for the World Cup in December, thousands
of women forced their way into the 100,000 seat male-only stadium
to honor the team. People danced in the street and soccer started
to mean change.
President Clinton has taped a goodwill message with the hope it
will be viewed on TV by Iranians during the game and a Swiss
referee has been chosen to make sure things are neutral.
Symptomatic of the country's identity crisis, Iranians have been
flipping channels between the World Cup action and the dramatic
broadcasts of the popular, reformist, mayor of Tehran. He is
defending himself against religious conservatives who have put him
on trial.
Even today is not just saved for soccer. Sunday is a work day
here and the hard-line Iranian parliament is holding an impeachment
hearing for one of Khatami's most important cabinet members.
