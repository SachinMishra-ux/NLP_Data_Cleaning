So is the C70 worth the price? My test drive followed time in
the CLK and a couple of BMWs, and the C70 suffered in comparison in
terms of ride, handling and comfort.
Volvo's coupe inhabits an uncomfortable niche between sport and
luxury, and it comes off as neither flounder nor pheasant: front
drive inhibits the aggressive engine and the body structure seems
oddly unrefined. The car's luxury pretensions are undercut by a
jumpy rough-road ride.
After driving a car so costly, I'm usually sad to see it go. But
I walked away from the C70, admired the sweep of its sheet metal
one last time, and never looked back. 
A C70 convertible will go on sale early next month at a price
estimated at $44,000. Options will push fully equipped models close
to $50,000, where the C70 will compete with the Mercedes CLK320
Cabriolet, which arrives in the fall.
The C70 is Volvo's first convertible since the plastic-body
Volvo Sport of 1956, and it is a stylish showcase for a company
trying to break out of its safe, staid box.
The top goes up or down at the push of a button, with no latches
to release or covers to snap in place. Touching another button
lowers all four windows simultaneously.
Like the coupe, the convertible is elegantly appointed the
test car had unusual, but pleasing, suede-like seat inserts but
front legroom is glaringly short. The back seat was a revelation,
though, with plenty of room for two adults whether the top was up
or down.
Twin roll bars pop up behind the rear head restraints if a
sensor detects that the car may roll over. But the mechanics for
the roll bars and the elaborate power top steal much of the trunk
space.
While the C70 convertible looks like the coupe, it uses the less
powerful 2.4-liter five-cylinder from the S70 GLT. With a
light-pressure turbo-charger, it pumps out 190 horsepower, 46 less
than the coupe.
The soft-top comes only with a four-speed automatic
transmission, and its standard tires and wheels are smaller,
16-inch versions. With less power and an extra 250 pounds of
reinforcement, the convertible does not have the coupe's
neck-snapping takeoff.
