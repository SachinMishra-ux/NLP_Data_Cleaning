Among those who did not rise at the crack of dawn to follow
Elizabeth from her 6 a.m. check-in to her delivery at 10:40 a.m.,
was Christopher Rywalt, a New Jersey resident who tried to showhis
wife's delivery live through the internet last year.
He had arranged to show his wife's delivery over the Web, but
the hospital pulled the plug at the last minute.
DAYTON, Ohio -- Xiomara Young joined the millions of people who
shopped on the Internet this year. But she wasn't in the market for
a CD, a book or a car. She shopped for and found a job with Bank
One Dayton.
Indeed, Dayton-area employers increasingly are trawling the
Internet for workers as a way to fish for talent in a shrinking
labor pool. They see it as a way to broaden their reach, in
addition to buying traditional classified ads in newspapers.
Dozens of free and for-fee sites on the Net allow head hunters
and job seekers alike to find each other in a way impossible just a
few years ago. Several, including JobTrak, link employers with
colleges, offering the next best thing to on-site recruiting.
The Internet as job-recruiting tool takes on added significance
when mapped against a joint University of Dayton and Wright State
University study this year, which showed there are more than 48,700
local jobs available in this time of near-record low unemployment
levels.
Susan Hoying, global recruitment director for NCR, offered a
hard lesson for companies posting their own employment sites. In
its haste to launch an employment page about two years ago, NCR
tabbed a third party, CareerMosaic, the hottest job bank on the
Web.
Moreover, the job site is not on the same computer server as the
rest of NCR's Web pages, meaning the company has to go through
CareerMosaic to update the listings.
The Internet has brought the world's employers to home PCs.
Workers can look for jobs virtually anywhere in the world, any time
of day, increasing the choices of an already mobile workforce. More
advances are on the way.
New software in the works will let job seekers keypunch their
desired position, salary, location and other requirements and have
their PCs hunt the Web for suitable jobs. The software will alert
users when the search is done and keep the list on file.
