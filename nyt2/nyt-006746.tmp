LONDON A consortium of American investors, including Microsoft
Corp.'s co-founder, Bill Gates, said Thursday that it had agreed to
acquire the British luxury hotel company Cliveden PLC for 42.8
million pounds, or $71.1 million.
The consortium consists of Destination Europe Ltd., which is
owned by two real estate investment firms, Lowe Enterprises and LF
Strategic Realty Investors, in addition to Cascade, the personal
investment company of Gates.
Cliveden is best known for the Cliveden Hotel in Berkshire, near
London, a stately home set on a 375-acre estate on the bank of the
Thames. It was built in the middle of the last century for the Duke
of Sutherland and became the home of the Astor family and the site
of glittering parties in the Edwardian era. The estate gained
notoriety in 1963 when Harold Macmillan's minister of war, John
Profumo, was found having an affair there with Christine Keeler, a
call girl.
The British hotel company also owns the Cliveden Town House near
Sloan Square in London and the Royal Crescent Hotel in Bath. The
company is also currently in the process of converting the former
headquarters of Scottish Equitable in Edinburgh into a luxury hotel
scheduled to open next spring.
The acquisition comes amid a flurry of investment this year by
American companies in Britain's hotel business. In April,
Blackstone Group paid 520 million pounds, and Patriot American
Hospitality bought Arcadian for 92 million pounds.
LF Strategic Realty Investors owns 65 percent of Destination
Europe USA, the holding company for Destination Europe Ltd.; Lowe
Enterprises owns 25 percent of the company, and Cascade holds 10
percent.
PARIS An American tour company said Thursday that 15,000 World
Cup tickets were stolen from its Paris office Thursday morning, the
latest twist in the uproar over the sale of tickets for the
monthlong tournament.
Gillian Pattison, a spokeswoman for Prime Sports International,
said burglars broke into the company's offices early Thursday,
smashed a safe, grabbed cash worth over $560,000 and made off with
tickets for most of the remaining matches, including the final in
St.-Denis on July 12.
Police confirmed that the robbery had taken place. But it was
not clear why the company, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., had so
much cash or so many tickets in its office.
The theft came as complaints continued to pour in from thousands
of fans, including large Belgian, Brazilian and Japanese
contingents, who say tour operators have promised them tickets that
have not been delivered.
