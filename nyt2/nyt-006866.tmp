In the second-to-last week of the session, Silver said he would
accept the parole provision if it were linked to expanded education
programs in prisons and to laws allowing some felons to be
sentenced to drug treatment programs rather than prison. Pataki and
Bruno rejected those conditions, and despite negotiations that
continued far into the night Thursday, no compromise was reached.
The governor was the chief advocate for several other ideas that
died in the last few days, like casino gambling and creating
so-called charter schools, public schools with particular missions
that operate largely independent of the usual bureaucracy. The
Assembly Democrats and their allies, the teachers' unions, opposed
the governor's charter schools proposal, and while they insisted
they were open to some other version, there was little evidence of
a middle ground they would accept.
Pataki also wanted to see a change in law to allow mutual
insurance companies, which are technically owned by their
policyholders, to sell stock to outsiders with limited compensation
to policyholders. Under current law, a mutual insurance company can
sell stock but the policyholders must get most of it. The Assembly
leaders negotiated with the insurers until late Thursday, but no
deal was reached.
CLEVELAND If there was any doubt whether Orlando Hernandez is
good enough to face good teams, he put it to rest Thursday night,
when he pitched seven and two-thirds strong innings against the
Cleveland Indians.
Hernandez was out of the game before the Yankees won, 5-2,
snapping a tie in the ninth inning when Scott Brosius drew a
bases-loaded walk with an 11-pitch at-bat and then adding two more
runs. But Hernandez confirmed the Yankees' belief in him, and their
decision to keep him in the rotation and move Ramiro Mendoza to the
bullpen.
The Yankees had the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, and
Indians reliever Mike Jackson struck out Chad Curtis for the second
out. Brosius beat out what appeared to be a run-scoring infield
hit, but Tim Tschida, the home-plate umpire, ruled the ball was
foul, prompting a lengthy argument with Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager.
After Brosius resumed his at-bat he fouled off five two-strike
pitches before taking the walk that scored pinch-runner Homer Bush
with the lead run. A single and an error added two more runs in the
inning.
Hernandez was initially scheduled to pitch against Baltimore on
Monday, and quite logically, the Indians did not send an advance
scout to watch El Duque's last start, in Montreal on June 9. The
Yankees had two rainouts last weekend, Hernandez's subsequent start
was postponed, and the Indians then were left to examine videotape
of his previous outings, to look for patterns or tendencies or any
sort of clue to identify when and what Hernandez would throw.
They might have had more luck finding the Loch Ness Monster.
Hernandez, in his third major league start, mystified the Indians
completely with his cheek-high Bruce Lee leg kick, the gold chain
and cross dangling from his neck, his instinctual feel for
confusing batters.
Most starters become more vulnerable as the game progresses, as
opposing hitters begin to time their fastballs and better recognize
the off-speed stuff. But in the case of Hernandez, information
almost seems to be counter-productive; the Indians grew more
baffled inning to inning, at-bat to at-bat, as they guessed
incorrectly what Hernandez might try next.
