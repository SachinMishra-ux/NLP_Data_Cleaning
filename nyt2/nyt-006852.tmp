Other men wanted to race the riding mowers. But they turned pale

Evidence keeps mounting that the Chinese army is exploiting
flawed American export controls to acquire sophisticated satellite
communications technology for military and intelligence use. The
Pentagon and State Department are now questioning the pending sale
of a Hughes communications satellite whose upgraded design would
let Chinese authorities eavesdrop on mobile telephone conversations
at home and abroad. President Clinton should suspend this sale and
the licensing of any more satellite deals with China until export
control rules are tightened. In particular, he needs to put the
State and Defense departments back in charge of export approvals
and diminish the role of the Commerce Department.
Communications satellites must be carefully watched because they
have both military and civilian uses. Satellites for civilian
mobile telephones can be used by China's army to communicate with
remote field units. When equipped with powerful antennas and
computers, they can spy on other countries' communications systems.
In the mid-1990s, with China's own communications satellites
wearing out, military leaders set out to find foreign-built
replacements. The Clinton administration initially approved the
Hughes sale, it now says, after being advised that the Chinese
could purchase similar communications technology from European
sources. But since that approval, the project has been modified by
adding a more powerful antenna. It is not clear that China could
obtain comparable equipment from Europe.
Critics have suggested that the administration loosened the
rules on satellite sales because of large campaign contributions to
the Democratic Party from the American aerospace industry and, it
appears, Chinese military officials. In late 1996, the same year
Clinton initially approved the Hughes satellite, he granted the
aerospace industry a change in export licensing procedures.
Satellite licensing authority was shifted from the State and
Defense departments, whose concern is national security, to the
Commerce department, which promotes business deals.
But in a country like China, where aerospace and communications
companies have close links to the army and government, these deals
are rarely purely commercial. Clinton should work with Congress and
the intelligence agencies to evaluate any damage done and develop a
sounder policy. 
MONTREAL Montreal Manager Felipe Alou not only is Mel Rojas'
uncle, but also used to be his manager. That was when Rojas was at
his best as a reliever, from 1994-96. Now, Rojas, 31, is struggling
in his role as the Mets' setup man.
After Rojas had picked up the loss in Wednesday night's 5-4
victory over the Expos, the right-handed pitcher said one of the
reasons he has struggled this year against right-handed hitters is
because he throws so many more fastballs to them than to
left-handed hitters, against whom his main weapon is his
split-finger fastball.

World Airlines, died June 1 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
in New York. He was 74 and lived in New York.

named chairman and chief executive of Transworld Corp., a holding
company formed when the airline was restructured in 1978.
