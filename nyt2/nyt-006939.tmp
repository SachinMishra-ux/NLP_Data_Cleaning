Karl struggled with his point guard from start to finish.
Veteran Sonic players complained privately that Karl established
rules such as players must practice to play then let Payton
bend them with impunity. They also complained that Payton sometimes
strayed from Karl's game plans or would sometimes distance himself
from his teammates in critical moments of games when his leadership
was needed.
After the Sonics were dropped from the postseason, Karl met with
president Wally Walker to discuss the team's future. One of Karl's
suggestions was that the Sonics should be open to the possibility
of trading Payton for several players if the team experienced more
second-round jolts. It was the second time in four years that Karl
made such a plea.
Karl admired Payton's skills. To most observers, Payton is the
best point guard in the game. Karl also knows that Payton turned
him into a $3.5 million coach. Karl helped Payton become a $12
million player.
Their relationship, while respectful, was airtight only for
public consumption. Karl continuously insisted on more from Payton.
He wanted a type of leadership Payton isn't ready to give. In
Payton's view, playing hard and producing every night is enough;
Karl also wanted a second coming of Nate McMillan, a vocal leader
in the locker room as well as on the court.
Payton, though, is a superstar. And with superstars come
baggage. Now, it is Westphal's turn to carry the load.
Westphal knows the makeup of his best player. Payton often does
not practice. He is volatile and emotional. Payton is so
competitive that when he doesn't win, he transforms into someone
whose raging persona rivals the Incredible Hulk. Karl never got a
grip on that part of Payton.
Perhaps Westphal will. He is cut from the same cloth. Although
Westphal is considered laid-back now, he was a terror growing up.
Westphal told a childhood story about getting kicked out of a
sixth-grade game. He thought the officiating was terrible and
committed a flagrant foul.
So his meeting with Payton in Oakland earlier this week wasn't
about changing the eight-year Sonic. Westphal merely opened the
lines of communication as soon as possible.
For as little as Chicago's Phil Jackson is given credit for the
Bulls' success, the glory is his. Sure, Michael Jordan makes all
the game-winning baskets, but he is canning them Jackson's way.
Payton's reluctance about practice is due in part to his
chronically sore back, for which he gets regular treatment. It's
not in the club's best interest that he risks aggravating the
problem in practice.
