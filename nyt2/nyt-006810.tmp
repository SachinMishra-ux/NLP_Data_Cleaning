The list includes 10 publicly traded companies, and their shares
tumbled before the official announcement was made. The Korea stock
exchange suspended their shares after the announcement, including
Korea Tungsten, Haitai Stores, Haitai Electronics, Haitai
Confectionery, Hanil Synthetic Fiber, Dai Han Wool Textile, Tong
Kook General Electronics, Shinho Electric and Communications and
Young Jin Co.
Under the leadership of the new president, Kim Dae-jung, the
government has promised to allow market forces to steer the
economy, but the commission's list, dictating the life and death of
scores of companies, seemed to contradict that commitment.
There were some notable absences from the group marked for
extinction. Samsung Motors, a new car manufacturing unit of the
Samsung group, for instance, is clearly not financially viable at
the moment.
Launched this spring after the Asian financial crisis turned the
South Korean economic miracle into a bust, the car company cost
$4.8 billion to put together and must compete with already
established contenders like Hyundai, Daewoo and bankrupt Kia Motors
in a domestic market now less than half the size of a year ago.
Planning to produce just 80,000 cars this year, the company is not
even close to breaking even.
The aim of the big deal is to push the chaebol into
consolidation by forcing them to swap businesses with each other.
Hyundai Motors, for example, could adopt Samsung Motors in exchange
for its semiconductor business, which could be absorbed by Samsung
Electronics, one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors.
Lee, the commission's chairman, said the top five conglomerates
were to come up with revised business plans by the end of July that
would hopefully involve such deals.
Bankers said the list issued Thursday was problematic for those
chaebol that have already begun efforts to sell subsidiaries now
fingered for extermination. The Hanwha group would have liked to
put all or part of the Otron Co., a mobile telephone handset
manufacturer that is on the list, on the block, but now any
disposal would probably be a fire sale.
The list also is likely to worsen unemployment, which has
already hit more than 1.5 million people this year. While several
chaebol said Thursday that they would try to find jobs for workers
from companies on the list, it will be hard to absorb all of them.
HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. For more than a decade, Michael
Laudor had wrestled with the demons of schizophrenia, managing to
eke out startling victories over the delusions and hallucinations,
like a degree from Yale Law School and more than $2.1 million in
book and movie contracts for his life story.
But Thursday the disease seemed to have snatched its own brutal
victory. Laudor was charged with the murder of his 37-year-old
pregnant fiancee, Caroline Costello, a technology administrator at
the Edison Project, the private firm that manages public schools.
