Derek Jeter, in the final step of rehabilitating his abdominal
strain, played shortstop for the Yankees' Class AAA Columbus
Clippers Thursday night, in Durham, N.C. He hit two doubles and
struck out in four at-bats. He also made a throwing error.
Jeter is expected to join the Yankees on Friday and play against
Cleveland, after being activated off the 15-day disabled list.
Chad Curtis was not in the first lineup posted in the Yankees'
clubhouse Thursday. But after talking to Curtis and examining the
statistics of the Cleveland starter, Charles Nagy, Joe Torre
reinserted Curtis in center field. He was 1 for 3.
A columnist at The Boston Globe, a Pulitzer Prize finalist,
fabricated people and quotations in four of her columns this year,
and the newspaper has asked for her resignation, The Globe
announced Thursday.
In one case, she made up nearly an entire column about a woman
dying of cancer, the newspaper said.
Storin said he had yet to receive Ms. Smith's letter of
resignation. But in Ms. Smith's final column, published in Friday's
issue of The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., she
acknowledges her misdeeds.
Ms. Smith did not respond to messages left on her voice mail at
work, and her home telephone was out of service. Her lawyer, John
Williams of the Boston firm Palmer Dodge, also did not respond to
voice-mail messages.
This was the second time in Ms. Smith's career that her
credibility had come under fire. As an editorial assistant at The
Chicago Sun-Times in the late 1980s, she wrote a review of a
concert that she had not attended, a former colleague recalled. The
newspaper ran a correction, but she was not dismissed.
The revelations about Ms. Smith come just a week after The New
Republic published the results of an investigation into the work of
Stephen Glass, a staff writer, who it said had fabricated parts or
all of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for the magazine in two and a
half years.
The Globe said it discovered Ms. Smith's fabrications two weeks
ago during normal monitoring by senior editors. Under the system,
which Storin said he established two and a half years ago, editors
occasionally double check columnists' sources.
