NEW YORK There's Betsey, her hair in gravity-defying Raggedy
Ann orange pigtails, dressed for success in a bra-revealing
bustier, tightly laced over a teeny flowered minidress worn over
black leggings and, for comic relief, striped socks and sparkly
blue platform shoes.
And then there's Lulu in a simple black cardigan, her blond hair
hanging down her back, her long, slim legs encased in black
boot-cut pants. The only thing they seem to have in common is
matching tattoos a lightning bolt over the left breast.
If Betsey Johnson, 55, isn't exactly growing up she ended her
latest Bryant Park fashion show with a trademark cartwheel her
daughter, Lulu, 23, who is in charge of the designer's Ultra line,
has definitely brought a new level of sophistication to her
mother's fashion carnival.
Betsey Johnson picks her daughter up every morning for work.
They share an office space with desks that face each other. They
giggle, constantly interrupt each other, complete each other's
sentences and generally act like joined-at-the-hip best friends without ever losing sight of the bottom line.
The Betsey Johnson company, which was founded in 1978 by Ms.
Johnson and a partner, Chantal Bacon, now has 23 outlets and had
revenues of $38 million last year, Ms. Bacon said. In 1995, the
company introduced the pricier Ultra line, which is aimed at the
designer-label buyer and Ms. Johnson's celebrity clients, including
Jenn
Lulu earned her fashion stripes working as a runway model in her
mother's shows, and as a salesgirl in the company's stores during
summer vacations. After high school, she went to work full time for
the company. Her biggest contribution may be that she represents
the company's target demographic. She keeps her mother abreast of
the club scene, the latest videos, the hottest new models.
But Lulu's fashion sense is at the other end of the spectrum
from her mother's punk, sex-kitten style. The clothes Lulu designs
for the Ultra line include slinky, hand-beaded slip dresses, tiny
cardigans, fake fur-trimmed embroidered satin coats and cashmere
separates.
The Ultra line, whose prices range from $300 to $2,500 more
expensive than the original Betsey Johnson line is the most
obvious effort to give the company legs. It tends to appeal to a
more sophisticated customer than the typical buyer of Betsey
Johnson's signature clothes.
A few days before Fashion Week, everybody t the Betsey Johnson
showroom was engaged in the same activity frantically nailing
rhinestones to skimpy garments for the designer's show. Manning
their stud guns, dozens of assistants looked like Santa's elves, if
Santa were based in Las Vegas. Paper-doll thin Irene Wright, the
company's fitting model, sidled in in a gold lame dress.
