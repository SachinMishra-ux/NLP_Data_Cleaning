Subdued for five superb innings by Florida rookie Jesus Sanchez,
the Braves turned around Wednesday night with a four-run sixth to
beat the Marlins 6-2 and make Maddux baseball's first 10-game
winner of the year. Scratched for two unearned runs in the fourth
off a Tony Graffanino error, Maddux bore down to hold Florida
scoreless the rest of the way to improve his record to 10-2.
Winning their fourth straight, the Braves finally subdued
Sanchez with a four-run sixth, Gerald Williams' two-run double the
critical blow. Chipper Jones then closed the show with a two-run
homer in the seventh, his 18th of the year.
Maddux extended his win streak to eight games, the longest in
the NL this season.
Held scoreless for the first five innings for just the seventh
time this season, the Braves went up 4-2 in the sixth, which Maddux
began with a cue-shot single past first baseman Ryan Jackson. After
Walt Weiss walked on four pitches, Williams ripped Sanchez's first
pitch down the left field line, scoring both men to tie it. The
double was Williams second of the game and his third in his
previous four at-bats.
Andres Galarraga, who had struck out twice with men on, hit the
first pitch into the right-center gap for a 3-2 lead and after
Andruw Jones walked to load the bases, Danny Bautista sent a
shallow fly into right field. Chipper Jones tagged up anyway and
scored easily for a 4-2 advantage when Mark Kotsay's throw bounced
twice on the way to the plate.
Through the first five innings, Sanchez struck out nine and
although he had allowed a pair of doubles, both times he maneuvered
around the trouble. After Chipper Jones' two-out double in the
first, Sanchez struck out Galarraga to end the inning. After
Williams opened the fourth with a double, Sanchez fanned both Jones
and Galarraga before inducing an inning-ending ground-out from
Andruw Jones.
Maddux faced the minimum through the first three innings but
Todd Dunwoody became a problem in the fourth when he reached first
on second baseman Tony Graffanino's fourth error of the season.
Advanced to third by Edgar Renteria's sacrifice and Kotsay's
ground-out, Dunwoody scored the night's first run on Todd Zeile's
single.
Zeile, hitting .363 with runners in scoring position and two
outs since joining the Marlins, stole second on a 2-1 pitch to
Cliff Floyd. The Marlins' lead then grew to 2-0 when Floyd sent a
sinking liner into right, which Williams could not handle in a
diving attempt. Both runs were unearned.
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. In this region with one of America's fastest
growing Hispanic populations, little-known scientist Stephen D.
Mumford offers an unorthodox solution to the immigration problem he
sees brewing.
He suggests that developing nations supply women with tiny pills
that prevent pregnancy by scarring their fallopian tubes pills that
Mumford already supplies. The permanent sterilization would, in
turn, reduce the number of immigrants to the United States.
