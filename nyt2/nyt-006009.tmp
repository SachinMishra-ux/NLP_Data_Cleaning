Under both proposals, most of the money would go to roughly
124,000 farmers; if they receive $28 billion, that averages some
$200,000 per farmer.
Farmers are split on the two alternatives; some support the
Lugar provision because it would allow them to continue growing
tobacco. Prices would fall, but so would costs. Others want the
option of keeping the quotas to maintain high prices if they decide
not to relinquish their quotas.
Boyd defended payments to nonfarmers who own quotas, arguing
that many are widows who lease their quotas to survive.
The outcome of the tobacco bill remains murky after a month of
contentious debate. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called for a
closed-door meeting of rank and file Republicans Wednesday to
determine strategy.
Key Republicans continue to oppose the legislation because it
constitutes a huge tax increase and creates many new federal
programs. But GOP ranks broke when amendments were approved to cut
taxes for married couples and increase health insurance tax
deductions for the self-employed. If the bill clears the Senate, it
faces stiff opposition in the House, which also could make
substantial changes.
The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
