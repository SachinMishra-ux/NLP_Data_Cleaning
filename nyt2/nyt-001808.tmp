Farris decided to begin educating his six-year-old daughter at
home when he realized that she cared more about the approval of
other six-year-olds than she did about her own family.
Harvard's Illingworth says the sociability of home-schooled
applicants varies as much as it does among ordinary ones. The
exceptions come from religious families who have deliberately
withdrawn their children from a world they consider tainted.
One shadow lies over home schooling. Joe Nathan, a senior fellow
at the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the University of Minnesota,
has spent much time interviewing parents who teach at home.
In general, he considers home schooling to be a good thing for
bringing change to the public schools; many home schoolers have
already been drawn back into the system by charter schools and
other such experiments. But there is a worrying group lurking in
the home-schooling shadows.
Even so, most home-schooling parents choose to teach their
children at home at great cost to themselves because they reckon
the public schools are missing the mark; and, in many cases, they
are right.
A surge of defections may finally send a wake-up call to the
whole public system. Rather than merely talking of change, it is
time to bring some about. (To publish this fascinating 1,200-word article, it must be

CHICAGO Education has always been a local issue in America.
Now an increasing number of parents are choosing to make it even
more local: they are doing it themselves.
Home-schooling groups put the number of students learning at
home at 1.23 million, or slightly more than all the public-school
students in New Jersey. Such numbers are notoriously imprecise,
since some of the most populous states, such as Texas and Illinois,
collect no meaningful data on home schooling.
Still, experts reckon that the number of families teaching their
children at home has exploded over the past decade and is growing
by at least 15 percent a year.
Why? Twenty years ago home schooling was a hippie habit, the
natural complement to free love and natural healing. But the flower
children soon had strange bedfellows.
