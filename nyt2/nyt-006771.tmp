CHINA-TRAVEL BEIJING If you know China, don't bother reading
this. You are already convinced that from megalopolis to
mist-shrouded mountaintop, China is an engaging place. This is
written for the couple of hundred million other Americans who may
love to knock about in bizarre places but haven't yet made it to
the Middle Kingdom. You'll find that China offers spectacular
travel riveting vistas, exotic cultures embracing thousands of
years, enticing food on almost every corner of every city. If the
news coverage surrounding President Clinton's trip to China June
25-July 3 intrigues you whether it's an aged peasant's creased
smile or the serenity of a Guilin lagoon that sinks the hook in
your wanderlust make a plan and go for it. In the three months
we've been living and working in China, we've managed a sampling of
some not-to-miss places. China is more tourist-friendly than ever.

With CHINA-TRAVEL-SIDE BEIJING This is the city central to
your China trip. From the chaotic alleys called hutongs to the
grace of the Forbidden City built for the emperor and his
entourage, China's capital can keep you happily occupied for five
days. After that, it gets to be work. An aimless stroll or float
across the lake in Beihai Park will put you in the company of
Chinese relaxing away an afternoon. Or try hunting down the Niujie
Mosque, where tranquil gardens date back to the 15th Century, and
the nearby Fayuansi Buddhist temple to see an ancient spiritual
dimension of modern Chinese life. Here are some recommendations
specific to Beijing touring. (Albright/Kunstel, Cox News Service).
CLINTON-TRIP When he visits China later this month, virtually
everything President Clinton does every step he takes, every
place he goes, every bite he eats - will have been choreographed
weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women who will have
scheduled every second of his trip. After spending hours studying
videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret Service agents
will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and air ducts
blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting bombs. His
armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead. Hotels will have
been comandeered for the president and his entourage. Detailed
briefing books will have been prepared for him, providing
classified information on the ranking officials with whom he will
meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the traveling
White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will have been
installed so the media can beam images back to the United States.
In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around the
clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make sure
the whole thing goes off without a hitch. Bob recently represented
the print press corps on a trip to China with about 40 White House
advance people responsible for putting the trip together. This
would be a behind-the-scenes look at how a WH trip is staged.

MICROSOFT-CULTURE REDMOND, Wash. Microsoft has brought a new
corporate style to the corridors of corporate America. It lets
low-ranking employees help shape corporate policy, but takes a
hard-nosed stance against corporate or government influence. A
visit to Microsoft's campus to see how this culture has helped
produced not only the world's most popular software whose latest
version ships Thursday, June 25 but also a bitter antitrust
battle. (Glass, Cox News Service).

OPENLIVES Twenty-four hour video cameras monitor Central Park.
At some day care centers, parents now look in via the Internet to
check on how their children are being treated. Electronic databases
track the movies you rent. Automated gas pumps record where you
fill your tank. Your boss may be reading your E-Mail, or counting
the keystrokes you type. Don't like someone looking over your
shoulder? Better get used to it. Author, futurist and physicist
David Brin says we're hurtling headlong into an era when everyone's
life will soon be an open book. Welcome to the Transparent Society.
