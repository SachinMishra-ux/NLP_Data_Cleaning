White supremacy may be marginalized, but it is still menacing.
The sheriff's claim that there are no Ku Klux Klansmen in Jasper
appears to be false. A local Klan leader insists that his group has
a strong presence there.
And already the town is bracing itself for a Klan march on June
27, with its potential for a bloody showdown between white bigots
and Black Panther hotheads.
The murder has also shed light on the fact that state prisons in
Texas and across the South have become purveyors of white
supremacy, recruiting susceptible men into violent gangs such as
the Aryan Brotherhood.
And what of Jasper? This is a community of mutual respect, but
it is still distinctly divided at all the levels that matter in
ordinary life.
What the boys on the basketball court cared about was not
whether white kids came and played ball with them. They cared about
good jobs, fair treatment and about the fact that Dennis Rodman,
the bad-boy star of the Chicago Bulls, had elected to pay for
Byrd's funeral. It sounded awfully like separate but equal. (To publish this compelling 1,025-word article, it must be

JASPER, TEXAS At dusk on Friday night, at the end of a
difficult week in the east Texas town of Jasper, 80 or so boys were
playing basketball in the park.
Two games were in progress, one at each net. Boys rose up,
caught air, dunked baskets. Cars were drawn up close to the court,
doors open, pumping out a heavy urban beat into the sultry air.
Every player was black, all the attendant girlfriends were black,
all the hangers-on were black. There was not a white in sight,
apart from this correspondent.
The scene, and the conversation, would not be unusual in
inner-city America. In a town of 8,000 people, it gives pause for
thought.
Jasper is a quiet, pretty place, with forests and lakes that
look more like Finland than Texas. Down one country road you pass a
creek, a meadow dappled in sunshine, then you go on into dense
emerald forest.
This spot is where the last sinews on James Byrd's neck tore
loose and his head the face already shredded on the tarmac bounced off into a ditch.
