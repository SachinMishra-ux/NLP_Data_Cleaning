The glowing newlyweds looked as if they had just stepped out of
a Hallmark greeting card.
Only a week earlier they were joined in a church. Now they were
basking in each other's presence, flipping through their wedding
album and making plans for their honeymoon in Greece. It was a
typical snapshot of post-wedding bliss except for one unusual
detail:
Michael Calvert and Bryan Keever were joined during a commitment
ceremony in the Christ Covenant Metropolitan Community Church near
downtown Decatur, Georgia. The MCC is a congregation founded by and
for homosexuals. Calvert, an MCC deacon, could not envision
worshipping or marrying anywhere else.
Eleven o'clock Sunday morning may be the most segregated hour in
America, but a new kind of church division is now taking place a
growing separation between the straight and homosexual religious
communities. Gays and lesbians in metro Atlanta, no longer willing
to wait for mainstream churches to embrace them, have in recent
years created their own religious groups.
The Southern Voice, a weekly catering mostly to the city's gay
community, lists at least 40 places of worship in the Atlanta area
that welcome gays and lesbians. A few are part of mainstream
denominations, defiantly ignoring church doctrine. But most were
specifically created for homosexuals.
If mainline churches continue to reject the inclusion of
homosexuals, leaders of gay places of worship say, their
congregations will prosper. According to MCC officials, they have
one of the fastest-growing Christian denominations in the world.
Since its founding in Los Angeles in 1968, MCC has grown to about
300 churches in 17 countries. MCC's worldwide membership, officials
report, is now at 32,000.
The Metropolitan Community Church was founded by Troy Perry, a
minister defrocked by his Pentecostal church for homosexuality.
After recovering from a suicide attempt, Perry said he received a
call from God to start a church that affirmed gays and all other
outcasts.
Still, don't expect any homosexual megachurches in Atlanta or
elsewhere. Most gay places of worship have comparatively small
memberships. The MCC congregation that Calvert and Keever attend
has about 220 members. The Unity Fellowship Church, which is
predominantly black and open to gays, has about 25 members.
Congregation Bet Haverim has about 165 members.
Ironically, though many homosexuals feel uncomfortable in
mainstream places of worship, they insist on retaining the
trappings of such traditional faith communities.
The Metropolitan Community Church in Decatur, for example, looks
as if it could have been lifted from a Norman Rockwell painting:
white steeple, stained-glass windows and an orange juice stand out
front. The MCC worship style includes the traditional sacraments of
baptism and Communion.
