The most conservative Republicans had been pressing for $150
billion in tax and spending cuts, but gave way when it became
apparent that such big cuts would make it impossible to pass the
plan in the House.
Although the party's leadership came up with the needed votes,
some moderates said they were voting for the plan only reluctantly,
fearing that the combination of big tax cuts and unspecified future
spending reductions imposed too much of a strain on legitimate
government programs and risked the nation's newfound fiscal health.
But during the floor debate, Gingrich appealed to party loyalty
and warned potential dissidents not to distance themselves from the
party's accomplishments of the past few years.
MEXICO CITY The first showers of the rainy season have fallen
across parts of Mexico and Central America but have failed to
quench many wildfires that are destroying virgin forests and
feeding a smoke cloud that is drifting across the southern United
States, officials said Friday.
Mexican and American officials predicted that some fires, which
have consumed millions of acres of forest and grassland across the
region, may continue to rage for several weeks. About 150 fires, 23
of them large, very destructive blazes, were burning this week.
The U.S. delegation visited Mexico to coordinate a $5 million
assistance program, which includes a heavy-lift helicopter and
radios, as well as boots and other safety equipment for 3,000
Mexican forest rangers. Many Mexican firefighters have been wearing
straw hats and sandals while battling flames with buckets of water.
The American officials praised Mexico's battle to control the
fires, in which more than 60 firefighters have died this year.
He said many, perhaps most, of the blazes have started as
out-of-control agricultural fires, set by peasant farmers who
prepare their fields for planting by burning the previous year's
stubble. In other cases, forests have been set afire to clear plots
for growing marijuana or opium, he said.
WASHINGTON Republican leaders mustered enough support Friday
to pass a five-year $101 billion tax cut plan, but it was hardly a
victory for some GOP moderates concerned that making deeper
reductions in social programs to pay for it could hurt them in an
election year.
The non-binding budget resolution was approved by a narrow
margin of 216-204. It lays out an ambitious plan to cut taxes by an
additional $101 billion over the next five years and to pay for it
by making the same amount of cuts in various entitlement programs.
But it fails to specify how much would be trimmed from areas such
as welfare, education and Medicaid, and it includes no
recommendations on how to pay for $25 billion in extra spending
included in the recently approved highway and agriculture bills.
