More than 100 ministers who supported Creech signed a statement
vowing to continue to bless same-sex unions, while those outraged
at the verdict called for a special session of the denomination's
General Conference to deal with the aftermath.
After his bishop did not reappoint him to his Omaha church,
Creech announced that he will take a leave of absence from the
ministry and move to North Carolina. His last sermon in the Omaha
pulpit will be today.
The Methodists are just one group of many in Christendom
struggling with questions of same-sex relationships.
Presbyterians, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Catholics, Baptists and
members of the United Church of Christ have their own skirmishes.
The votes and charges at the national level have filtered down into
metro Atlanta's pews and pulpits, in some cases causing division
within churches and defection from denominations.
On a practical level, the great church debates center on two
questions: Should there be a rite for same-sex unions? And, should
sexually active gay men and lesbian women be ordained to church
office?
But on a theological level, what is at stake may be much greater
than a ceremony or a clerical position. Some leaders on both sides
of the line see themselves in a battle for the soul of the church.
The names of two movements within United Methodism describe the
attitudes of the two factions toward the church. Reconciling
Congregations are those who intentionally include gays and
lesbians, focusing on the need to bring in and nurture everyone as
a member of God's family. Transforming Congregations are those who
believe homosexuals can be changed in their orientation through
God's healing powers, or can find the courage to live a life of
celibacy in order to conform to the church's teaching.
While both sides say they see sexual expression ideally as an
expression of commitment and love, in general those who would
prohibit the blessing of same-sex unions or the ordination of
sexually active homosexuals see sex as tied to procreation and
God's plan of creation.
A statement by the Alliance of Baptists, a moderate group of
Southern and American Baptists, is echoed in reports by other
denominations, including the United Methodist Church and the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). The statement says:
With more bishops, priests and ministers willing to defy their
denominations by blessing same-sex unions and ordaining
homosexuals, and more legislative action pending before several
bodies, there is no end in view.
