The only re-education occurred when visitors toured the sites
and the guards pretended to teach lessons in Communism.
Robert Joseph Cousy, without whom there would have been no
Boston Celtics for Bill Russell to lead in the direction of those
11 championships, played his final game as a Celtic on April 24,
1963. He had sprained an ankle during the game, but he returned
with his team in trouble against a good Lakers team. With The
Cooz's firm hand on the tiller, the Celtics nailed down
championship No. 6 that night in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
He played for the Boston Celtics, which means that his No. 14 is
just one of 18 retired numerals. So many great players have
performed for this team that it is understandable if the names and
achievements all sort of run together after a while. It is hard now
to conjure up the circumstance of the early '50s, when the Celtics
had no cachet in this town and the only reason most people went to
see the team play was the electrifying and magnetic presence of the
game's best passer, ballhandler, and thinker. Absent Cousy, the
Celtics would have quite literally ceased to exist.
Along with George Mikan, he was the NBA to the first generation
of professional basketball fans. This is why among People of a
Certain Age, Bob Cousy remains an airport traffic stopper. Bob
Cousy is one of the great American sports heroes of the century.
Much like his old coach, Red Auerbach, The Cooz respects the
past but does not wallow in it. He is, without question, more
knowledgeable about the modern NBA than any of his contemporaries
because he has left it only once in the 35 years since his
retirement, that being his six-year stint as coach at Boston
College (117-37). He coached the Cincinnati Royals from 1969
through the 23d game of the 1973-74 season, and before that
campaign was over, he began a local broadcast career that continues
to this day.
As anyone who has covered the Celtics in the last
quarter-century knows, The Cooz still does his homework. He goes to
home games in order to look over opponents he'll be discussing in
his road telecasts. He keeps voluminous files on every team. He is
always on top of the new talent. He doesn't settle for being a
raconteur. He is always current. The next night he mails in a
performance will be the first.
We can naturally assume he'll be back in the headset for another
few years. I mean, he (itals)is(unitals) Bob Cousy, is he not?
He has played against, played for, or witnessed every great team
the NBA has had to offer in the past five decades, which makes him
the ideal person to discuss the historic placement of the Chicago
Bulls.
But The Cooz will not sign on to the proclamation that the Bulls
are the greatest thing ever to come along or that their six titles
in eight years is an equivalent achievement to the Celtics' 11
championships in 13 seasons from 1957-69.
It's true. The 1962-63 Celtics included Russell, Cousy, Tom
Heinsohn, Havlicek, Frank Ramsey, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, and an
end-of-career Clyde Lovellette, all of whom have been inducted into
the Basketball Hall of Fame.
