Moreover, the $14 billion Janus Worldwide is still accepting new
investments, while Janus Overseas was closed at just $4.3 billion
earlier this year. At the time, Helen Young Hayes, who runs both
funds, said she was concerned that significant cash coming into the
fund would make her job more difficult. Why not close the larger
fund, too, Goldfarb asked.
Many people have voiced similar concerns since Janus Overseas
was closed to maintain the quality of its performance, a Janus
spokeswoman said.
However, she said, Worldwide can own United States stocks as
well as foreign stocks, and that makes it easier for Ms. Hayes to
maneuver.
They also begin to move more sluggishly, handicapped by their
larger size. Kaufmann is a clear example, said Goldfarb: its
performance has suffered as assets rose to today's $6.4 billion. A
fund official declined to comment.
At the $5.3 billion PBHG Growth fund, liquidity is a concern
because the fund needs to be able to move quickly to execute its
earnings momentum driven strategy, Goldfarb said. Gary Pilgrim, the
manager, said liquidity is less of a problem at lower-turnover
funds like his.
The $4.3 billion Mutual Discovery fund has moved to mid-cap
names in the United States, and its size will lessen its ability to
buy the smaller European stocks that had bolstered its performance,
Goldfarb says.
Robert Friedman, a manager of Mutual Discover, conceded that
Discovery has moved into mid-cap stocks, but noted that these tend
to be less volatile and that managers have more clout with
companies.
Sheer size reduces a fund's ability to add value through some
mid-cap and smaller-cap stocks, especially when funds balloon to
$20 billion or more.
This includes the $26.6 billion Vanguard Windsor II and
Fidelity's $18.7 billion Equity-Income II fund, which Goldfarb
nonetheless rates as buys because of their strong managers. But he
advised investors to select smaller alternatives, if available.
A Vanguard spokesman noted that Windsor II is run by four
different managers who trade independently, adding flexibility that
other large funds may lack. A Fidelity spokesman said the company
would close its funds if it were in the best interest of
shareholders.
