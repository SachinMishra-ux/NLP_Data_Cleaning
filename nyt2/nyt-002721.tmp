All this as Hincapie a winner turned loser in this race a year
ago was shooting over the finish line first in Sunday's First
Union US Professional Racing Organization Championship, winning in
6 hours 6 minutes 35 seconds.
Last year Hincapie hopped on the podium when he thought he was
the first American finisher, thus gaining the title of US
professional national champion. But he had it taken away minutes
later when judges disqualified him for illegally using a team car
to draft with in the race.
First, it was $30,000 for winning the race, which was 156 miles
long. Then it was a starred-and-striped jersey for being the first
American to win, and becoming the year's US pro national champion.
Finally, there was a silver cup and a check for $10,000 for winning
the Solidarity Cup, a series of races completed Sunday that took
place over the past two months in Poland and America.
The race that covered 10 circuits around downtown Philadelphia
traveled along the Schuylkill River, up the steep road called the
Manayunk Wall, and back down to make a loop in front of the fans at
the start-finish line. And the fast, crescendoing synthesizer music
and the announcer's frantic voice were not in the least too intense
for the drama that unfolded during the last half-hour.
As the riders made their way on the last three 3-mile circuits
of the race, the red, white, and blue Postal Service jerseys
dominated the lead pack of 30. The Polish, Spanish, and Italian
riders were trying to pedal up to the front and dominate, but
Hincapie said it was two Americans Frank McCormack, of Leicester,
Mass., and McCormack's brother Mark, of North Easton, Mass. who
were really causing him trouble.
So with just 200 meters to go, as riders jostled for position
and rode far faster than the 25.43 m.p.h. they had been averaging,
Hincapie made for the line. That, he said, is when his mind zoned
out.
ALAMEDA, Calif. The Raiders completed their final minicamp
Sunday, Mo Collins manned the left-tackle position. It isn't a
stretch to suggest Collins even as a rookie could become the
caretaker of quarterback Jeff George's blind side.
Pat Harlow, the returning starter at left tackle, missed all
three of the team's offseason minicamps. The Raiders are treating
Harlow carefully as he recovers from back surgery.
Coach Jon Gruden is optimistic that Harlow will be fine. If not and back pain can linger, as Harlow knows the all-important job
falls to Collins, the 23rd overall choice in the draft.
Collins played at Florida, so he knows something about
protecting the passer. He spent most of his college days at right
tackle; changing sides requires some adjustments in technique.
