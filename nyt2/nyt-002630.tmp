The explosion and the swift Pakistani reaction appeared likely
to increase tensions between the two countries longtime enemies
that have just stunned the world by setting off rival nuclear
tests.
Each has blamed the intelligence services of the other for
planting bombs and stirring up trouble among the region's many
fractious religious and ethnic groups.
Hussain, Pakistan's information minister, said the government
had an Indian agent in custody who had been captured near the
Indian border. He said the Indian had confessed to similar acts of
terrorism, including 10 bombings in a 9-week period this year that
resulted in 16 deaths and that wounded another 93 people.
He suggested, too, that a bombing earlier this week in a movie
theater in Lahore, which killed three people and wrecked the
theater, was part of an Indian-sponsored series of terrorist acts.
He said the main suspect was an Indian citizen.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan, on a tour of Persian
Gulf emirates and Saudi Arabia in hopes of garnering financial
support in the face of impending sanctions, announced plans to
visit Britain, Canada and the United States in an effort to build
support among Pakistani expatriots. He is scheduled to be in New
York on June 16. Money sent home by Pakistanis working abroad is
one of the main sources of income in the country's beleaguered
economy.
PHILADELPHIA A year ago, soon after the First Union U.S.
professional cycling championship, there were tears for George
Hincapie and his family tears of sorrow. Sunday, there were tears
again tears of joy as the 24-year-old New York native finally
won the national championship he thought he had captured last year.
In a frantic finish to a 156-mile circuit race through streets
and parks that had the pack flying at almost 45 miles an hour at
the end, Hincapie started sprinting with about 270 yards to go. He
won by 2 feet, the width of a bike wheel. Massimiliano Mori and the
Saeco-Cannondale team of Italy was second and Tomas Konecny of the
Czech Republic and the ZVVZ-Giant team was third.
Especially after last year. George Hincapie came in third here,
behind an Italian and an Australian. As the first American
finisher, he became the national champion. On the victory podium,
he was given a national champion's stars-and-stripes jersey and a
bouquet. And it was Father's Day, and Ricardo Hincapie had the gift
he wanted most.
Eighty minutes later, when they returned to their hotel, the
phone rang with awful news: officials said Hincapie's team car had
illegally led him back to the pack after he had a flat tire. They
disqualified him.
Also the high-rent zone because the $120,160 overall purse (with
$30,000 to the winner) makes this the world's richest one-day bike
race. The first 31 finishers were given the same time 6 hours 6
minutes 35 seconds, or 25.53 miles per hour. Of the 103 starters,
66 finished.
