There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour not including the crew of 26 can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies. And as a precaution, bottled
water is being flown for the president and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton to drink and bathe.
The president will take along his own car, too an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet.
Nine other armored limos will also be flown ahead to transport
various high-ranking officials accompanying the president.
Also flying ahead will be a pair of sport utility vehicles used
by the U.S. Secret Service agents who protect the president.
He will also take his own private telephone company banks of
switching and transmission gear must be transported and set up days
ahead of time for each stop he'll make so that the president can
talk with international leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere
around the world without worrying that someone else might be
listening. All told, it's estimated the White House will be taking
60 tons of communications gear.
Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized
corporation.The president will have his personal valet, for
instance, and Mrs. Clinton will bring her personal hairdresser.
Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
It isn't yet clear precisely how large the presidential
entourage to China will be, but some 800 people went along with
Clinton to Africa last spring, in addition to 200 journalists and
media technicians.
