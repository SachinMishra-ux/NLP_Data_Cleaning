In the first payoff from the state's new utility deregulation
law, a Boston buying cooperative is expected to announce today the
first large contract for commercial and municipal users to buy
electricity on the open market.
National Energy Choice LLC, acting as a broker, said it has
letters of intent with several hundred users businesses;
nonprofit organizations; cities and towns in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island to purchase electricity from Select Energy, the
unregulated subsidiary of Hartford-based Northeast Utilities, the
largest utility in New England.
The National Energy Choice program would officially start in
January 1999. It would be available initially to businesses and
organizations, but not residential customers. There are plans to
expand the program to residential customers after 2000, said Paul
L. Barrett, a National Energy Choice managing director.
Customers who sign up for the four- or five-year program will
pay about 5 percent less than what they pay utilities now, said
Steven M. Rothstein, managing director of National Energy Choice, a
company backed by Citizens Energy Corp.
The agreement is similar to but potentially larger than an
electricity purchase agreement between the Massachusetts Health and
Educational Facilities Authority and PECO Energy Co. of
Philadelphia.
Users that have signed letters of intent include movie theaters,
hotels, associations representing Massachusetts municipalities,
nursing homes, and newspapers, along with 30 school districts in
Rhode Island.
He said for communities that spend $500,000 per year on
electricity, about 30 percent of that cost will be in electric
generation. Users will save 5 percent on the electric generation
portion. National Energy Choice will earn a monthly fee of 15
percent to 24 percent of the money saved, said Barrett.
Customers can also save an additional 5 to 7 percent if they
pursue an optional energy efficiency program aimed at reducing
electrical consumption.
For those savings, Select Energy will conduct an energy audit
that would recommend improvements in heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning systems. Customers could use Select Energy or other
companies to perform the upgrades to qualify for the discount.
NEW YORK Long viewed as one of the world's most attractive
targets for terrorists, New York City has quietly undertaken an
ambitious effort to counter attacks carried out with deadly
chemicals or germs, according to city officials.
