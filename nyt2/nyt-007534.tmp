It's a different role today for Lehman, who has slept on the
54-hole Open lead the last three years and failed to win. But a 68
returned his confidence level after a Friday 75.
BOSTON The Boston Globe, answering allegations that its star
columnist, Mike Barnicle, had fabricated material in his work,
announced on Saturday that it had checked 364 of Barnicle's columns
and confirmed the existence of the people who were portrayed and
quoted.
The announcement came on Saturday in the wake of accusations by
Professor Alan Dershowitz of the Harvard Law School that The Globe
could have been guilty of applying a double standard based on
gender and race when it asked for the resignation of Patricia
Smith.
Ms. Smith, the only black female columnist at a major Boston
newspaper, resigned on Thursday after she admitted fabricating
information in her columns.
Dershowitz, who is white, has accused Barnicle, who is also
white, of falsely attributing a racist, sexist quote to him in a
1990 column.
Editors and librarians at The Globe checked the sources in 364
of Barnicle's columns through computer data bases and discussions
with the writer, Matthew V. Storin, the editor of The Globe,
announced on Saturday.
The Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co., has
occasionally checked the veracity of its Metro columnists' writings
since January of 1996, but undertook a full review of Barnicle's
work in light of Ms. Smith's admissions and Dershowitz's
allegations. The Globe is continuing to review the columns written
by Ms. Smith.
LOS ANGELES The lasting image of Michael Jordan's epic,
title-clinching shot in Game 6 of the NBA Finals may have to last a
long time.
The NBA and the players association have nine days to break a
three-month stalemate on a new labor pact or face another
owners-imposed lockout of the players the league's second labor
stoppage in four years.
Free agents will be frozen out. There will be no trades, no
player signings, no summer pro leagues, no NBA stars in the World
Championships.
