The Transportation Improvement and Mitigation Program was not
properly circulated to the public for input before the City Council
voted 9 to 4 to approve the General Plan and an accompanying
Environmental Impact Report in 1996, the judge said.
Yaffe said he would not substitute his judgment for that of the
City Council on the merits of the proposal, but said the city was
legally obligated to disclose the transportation plan and its
warnings before adopting the General Plan.
Hal Bernson, who chairs the City Council's Planning and Land Use
Committee, harshly criticized the ruling even as he maintained it
would have little immediate impact.
Deputy City Attorney Susan Phann said depending on the wording
of the judge's written order to be finalized in two weeks the
General Plan might be allowed to remain in effect while the
transportation report is recirculated and hearings are held.
But Lawrence Teeter, an attorney for the federation, said he
believes the judge's action would temporarily set aside the city's
General Plan while the transportation issue is reheard.
Teeter said he does not see how the council could keep the
General Plan in effect while holding hearings on whether it is
adequate.
Gordon Murley, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners
Organization and the federation, said the ruling allows a new
challenge about whether the growth plan adequately deals with
traffic and transit problems it would generate.
If the city were allowed to grow at the levels envisioned by the
plan, freeway speeds would grind to half what they are nowunless
mass transit was greatly expanded.
Growth allowed under the disputed plan would create a huge gulf
between needs and critical services, leaving the city short 6,100
police officers, 77 fire stations and 87 schools.
The General Plan is a land-use guide for city planners in
judging zoning and building applications, channeling new
development into areas where public agencies would have to invest
in service and transit upgrades.
