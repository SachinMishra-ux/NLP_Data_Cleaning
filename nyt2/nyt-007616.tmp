Living to be 100 is no longer viewed as a quirk of nature, but
as a distinct possibility, something to be worked for. It is the
goal of the exercise and spirituality class for the aging that
Blondola Lucas, 76, a retired educator, leads at the White Rock
Baptist Church in Durham, N.C. One member of the class, James
Schooler, who can do 25 push-ups at a clip, has seven years to go.
Still, attitudes toward the very old are a mixture of admiration
and dread. About 30 percent of centenarians have full command of
their faculties and are living in the community, said Leonard Poon,
director of the University of Georgia gerontology center, and the
director of a 10-year study of centenarians.
But Poon, whose research confirmed findings of earlier studies
in Germany, said that about 45 percent of centenarians had some
sort of disability, varying in severity.
And disability can set in well before 100. According to the
census, 47 percent of those 95 and older are in nursing homes.
(Among those 85 and older, 22 percent are in nursing homes, while
the number drops to 7 percent for those 75 to 84, and 1 percent for
people ages 65 to 74.) The average centenarian lives to be 102.
The country's mixed perceptions of aging and longevity are
reflected by a 1996 poll for the Alliance for Aging Research.
According to the poll, 61 percent of Americans say they would like
to live to be 100, and while few expect to achieve that goal, 51
percent think they will live to be at least 80.
At the same time, a majority of Americans are anxious about
aging, with 64 percent saying they are worried about living for
years in a nursing home because of a physical frailty or long-term
illness, and 56 percent worried about developing Alzheimer's
disease.
When people talk about wanting to live to be 100, they surely do
not have in mind being severely disabled patients in a nursing
home. The paradox, says John Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai
Hospital and School of Medicine in New York City, is that people
want to live longer, but they do not want to get older or disabled.
While the research is still in its early stages, Rowe and other
experts say the evidence is that life is being prolonged, that
there is a modest compression of the amount of time people spend in
poor health during their final years.
For the next two weeks at Ye Olde All-England Lawn Tennis
Championships in Londontown, there will be ye young tennis starlet
Anna Kournikova as the target of sneers and jeers, yet revered by
the media.
Maybe that kinda kids' stuff plays in Siberia. Maybe in England,
it plays in the tabloids. But over here, where even a simple
traffic signal knows when it's right to stop and go, we tend to get
a little uptight about these March-July relationships.
