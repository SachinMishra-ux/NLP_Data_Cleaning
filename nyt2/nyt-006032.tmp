Still, many Americans appear to be embracing the information age
tentatively, if not fearfully. More than half of all computer
users, 52 percent, say they have never installed a software program a basic step in computing. While technology enthusiasts never
tire of extolling the virtues of computers as personalized tools of
empowerment, the Times/CBS poll suggests that a large share of the
computer-using public has no interest in tailoring their machines
or changing them.
The portrait of many people as passive recipients of computer
technology may also cast some doubt on one of Microsoft's arguments
in its dispute with the government. The Justice Department,
Microsoft says, has overstated the advantage the company enjoys
because the main desktop screen that users see when they turn on
their machines is Microsoft's Windows. That first screen can be
easily changed or modified, Microsoft insists.
Microsoft's market power is viewed with both ambivalence and
pragmatism, according to the Times/CBS poll. Monopoly, it seems, is
no longer regarded as an economic evil. A majority of those
questioned say Microsoft is a monopoly a label Microsoft itself
shuns but 77 percent also say Microsoft makes high-quality
products. And 58 percent of computer users and 67 percent of people
who have installed software themselves consider Microsoft's
dominant role in the software business to be good for consumers.
A certain ambivalence about big, successful companies, and what
the government's role should be in policing them, has been a theme
of American public opinion for decades, analysts say.
Consider Christopher Rogers, a 25-year-old medical student in
Philadelphia, who seems little concerned by the dominance of
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
Still, Rogers, like others polled, is skeptical about whether
consumers would benefit if Microsoft were to control the market for
software used for browsing the Internet a market that is a focus
of the Justice Department's case. Only 8 percent of those polled
said it would be a good thing if Microsoft dominated the browser
market, 41 percent said it would be bad, 39 percent said it would
make no difference and 12 percent had no opinion.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
