Maybe a reserved treatment is surprising from NBC just coming

that the Kings left because of the signal's lack of penetration in
the San Fernando Valley and because the station presented many more
conflicts with other teams' broadcasts....
UCLA's football game at Miami on Sept. 26 will be on CBS'
schedule with a 9 a.m. kickoff time locally, and Terry Donahue will
