 A senior executive who runs several miles to work in his
two-piece jogging suit and then strips to his T-shirt and running
shorts and begins work without bothering to shower.
 A senior partner in a law firm who wore a polo shirt and jeans
while greeting prospective clients in a major case. Judging him by
his clothing, they assumed he was an associate and went elsewhere,
offended because they thought the firm had assigned their case to
an inexperienced lawyer.
 A woman who sent productivity plummeting by arriving for her
job in the shortest of Lycra miniskirts and a strapless, stretchy
bandeau top.
Like many people, the doctor and his associate believed that
Casual Friday would spin out of control.
Arlene B. Isaacs, a New York City business consultant and
executive coach, remembers a 26-year-old client who took the
interpretation to extremes.
At their first meeting, Ms. Isaacs recalled, the client wore
high-heeled sandals and was encased in a floral polyester jumpsuit,
worn without a bra; her fingernails and toenails were painted
black, which matched the roots of her dyed blond hair.
Peter Giuliano, the chairman and founder of Executive
Communications Group, a consulting firm in Englewood, N.J., recalls
an instructor who led a program in media training for a client in
Tennessee.
Part of the program dealt with how to dress for a tough
on-camera interview, and how to handle the questions. Because the
participants were field technicians at a chemical plant, the
instructor disregarded their casual attire at the session work
boots, overalls and T-shirts.
One of the workers, however, had soot on his face and wore a red
bandanna around his neck, so the instructor gently told him to wash
for his final on-camera interview the next day.
The client did as told, turning up clean and shiny. He would
have made a perfect spokesman for the company, except for one
detail.
