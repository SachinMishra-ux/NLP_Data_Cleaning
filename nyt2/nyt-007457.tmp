But isn't it preposterous that haughty Notre Dame, the school
with its own football network (NBC), would join any conference? Ten
years ago, did you think the possibility of the Southwest
Conference dissolving preposterous?
The Big Ten has made overtures to Notre Dame before. This time,
I hear, it's a Godfather offer. Take it or leave it, Irish, there
won't be another chance. The Big Ten is going to 12 no matter what.
And if Notre Dame refuses, the Big Ten is prepared to invite
Syracuse from the Big East. That would begin the end of the Big
East, where Notre Dame has found a home for its sports other than
football.
With most of the second-tier bowls aligned with conference
tie-ins, Notre Dame is boxed out of the postseason if it fails to
earn a spot in one of the four Bowl Championship Series games. That
problem is solved if it joins the Big Ten.
(Quick aside on a juicy rumor: Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany
is considering emulating director James Cameron's King of the World
personna. He has talked casually of testing the limits of
expansion. 16 teams? 20? 28? 30? 32?)
If the Big Ten domino falls, then watch the feeding frenzy. Word
is the ACC is eager to reach a dozen members and has its eye on
Syracuse, Boston College and either West Virginia or Miami of the
Big East. The Big East is on the endangered species list.
The Pac-10 will get to 12 by inviting Colorado, a school which
considered a Pac-10 offer in the Big 12's infancy. And the Pac-10's
12th school?
BYU or Utah. Yes, either of the two leaders of the Western
Athletic Conference renegades would be a perfect fit; plus, the
Pac-10 has few other options if it wishes to expand.
All the breakaway WAC schools have is the good word of their
eight fellow defectors, so BYU and Utah are free to cut a better
deal. There is no honor among thieves or conference shufflers.
And no, the Big 12 wouldn't throw a lifeline to TCU or SMU to
become Colorado's replacement. With the SWC dead, Arkansas' escape
in 1992 has been erased from its permanent record. Arkansas would
be a geographic fit for the Big 12.
