The investigation at Montefiore, which has long been considered
a leader in caring for immigrant New Yorkers, is being watched
closely by other health care providers and by immigrants'
advocates, who hope to use it as leverage to bolster their demands
that hospitals and clinics improve their interpreting services.
Most of the city's hospitals and clinics rely on a patchwork of
bilingual staff members, volunteers and, at times, the children of
patients to do translation, said Francesca Gany, executive director
of the New York Immigrant Task Force on Health. This ad hoc system
frequently breaks down, she said, sowing confusion and making the
diagnosis and treatment of immigrants' health problems much more
difficult.
Over the last several years, civil rights inquiries around the
country have prompted changes in the way health care providers
offer translation for patients. In Colorado, the state social
services agency was cited for allowing the friends and family
members of patients to translate during psychiatric evaluations.
One patient, El Hong, 48, said that when he stumbled into the
clinic recently with severe diarrhea and stomach pain, he waited
seven hours until a translator could be found and he could be seen
by a physician. Hong later recalled the event, speaking through a
translator. He shook his head and said he did not know how he would
cope without the guidance of Ni Yann, a former translator who has
been reassigned as a medical records clerk.
But the guidelines do not require all institutions to employ
full-time interpreters. They can rely instead on bilingual staff
members or a pool of qualified volunteers or they can contract with
outside interpreters. Montefiore officials said that at its two
Bronx hospitals, a bank of volunteer interpreters and bilingual
staff members, who represent 44 languages, provide translation as
needed.
Several staff members at the clinic on 193rd Street said the
reassignments were inefficient, forcing them to scramble to find
bilingual employees who may be busy tending to other tasks and
forcing their patients to wait.
On Dr. Zach Rosen's shift a couple of weeks ago, for instance,
an elderly Cambodian woman with a history of hypertension came into
his office for a scheduled visit; neither spoke the other's
language. So, while the patient waited, Rosen said he ran around
looking for a medical assistant on the floor who spoke Khmer. She,
as it turned out, was busy translating for another physician down
the hall.
Some staff members also said the full-time interpreters were
crucial in offering a sense of safety to refugees still traumatized
by war and dislocation.
A nurse practitioner, Nancy Tenney, said an elderly Cambodian
woman who had recently been assaulted came in complaining of
numbness in her arm. Ms. Tenney suggested an MRI, but when the
patient was told that Ms. Yann would be unable to accompany her,
she refused the test.
BOSTON Raging winds, hail, and blinding thunderstorms pummeled
much of Massachusetts Sunday night, killing two people in a pickup
truck in Winchendon, Mass., cutting power lines, toppling tree
limbs, and threatening tornadoes for much of the night.
