The game is based on the mystery left behind by Professor
Faulkner, as revealed in a series of computer screens. Players face
a labyrinth of about 1,200 clues involving word and number riddles
tapping everything from ancient Hebrew letters to Morse code to
literary quotations.
In addition to solving the puzzle, winners were required to
submit an essay of at least 1,000 words explaining their answer.
Telephone operators list only one Dreizen in San Francisco Pamela. She did not respond to a phone message, and computer
searches under that name lead nowhere.
Gnant said P. Dreizen asked not to be identified further. He
added that game rules don't require the winner to go public, and he
is morally bound to respect Dreizen's request.
Gnant said he didn't release the winning essay because Dreizen
asked him not to, and because it contains personal information.
Still, Gnant refused to answer basic questions such as: How many
people were on the winning team? Is Dreizen male or female? When
was the winning entry submitted?
That date is critical to players who say they came up with the
mystery answer more than a year ago.
This week, Gnant acknowledged that Wigowsky solved the riddle
before Dreizen, but was disqualified because he did not place a
contest registration number in the appropriate place.
He said there was no celebration of the final results because
his company has switched from computer games to CD-ROM movies, and
he didn't want to spend money on a victory bash. SKEPTICS UNSATISFIED 
Bill Boucher, a Colchester, Vt., postal supervisor who spent
vacations working the puzzle, said Treasure Quest is so complex
that no one could solve it alone, yet the winner's name never
surfaced during two years of chat room exchanges.
