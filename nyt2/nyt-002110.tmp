In November 1938, Jewish leaders in Europe and in the United
States appealed to major western nations to take in the Jewish

Scotland and Wales.
Eva Burger, a Kindertransport survivor now living in Silver
Spring, Md., was 13 when she and her two sisters were rushed out of
their home town, Vienna, Austria, and shipped to London in 1939.

cultural barriers made her new life in England more difficult.
She was eventually reunited nine years later with her sisters
and their mother, who had survived the death camps. Her mother told
them their father had died in one of them.
