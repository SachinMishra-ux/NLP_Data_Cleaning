Meanwhile, Dun Bradstreet Corp. sent an analysis to the
congressional oversight panel warning that unless the government
takes more care in granting loans, it will continue to make bad
debts.
Among the cases it cited was a company that defaulted on one
federal loan and then was given a second loan from the same agency,
which it also failed to pay. Later, a second federal agency awarded
the same company $200,000 in contracts.
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. Behind nearly every Medal of Honor is a
gripping story of the valor that earned this nation's highest
award. But in its own right, the Medal of Honor itself has a
storied past in its rise to what is now considered the world's most
prestigious decoration.
Receiving the medal is unique and it involves such intense
bravery in mortal combat, that two out of three recipients are
presented the medal posthumously.
In additional to representing individualism and a person's
ability to bravely rise above his colleagues, the Medal of Honor
depicts the struggle of good over evil, the promulgation of
democracy. It is the most exalted of all medals awarded for combat
in this country.
Yet, the medal did not always stand for so much. Indeed, when it
was first awarded to soldiers in the Civil War after its
establishment by Congress in 1862, the criteria for receiving the
Medal of Honor, along with its design, were tinkered with more than
once. At one point, the Medal of Honor was being awarded to
soldiers from the Civil War who had managed to keep the Union flag
from touching the ground during a battle.
Then in 1918, Congress created other medals for bravery, such as
the distinguished service cross, in order to set apart the
significance of the Medal of Honor, Gibran said.
Two years earlier, a board of five retired generals appointed by
the Secretary of War were assigned to investigate whether anyone
had been awarded the medal for something other than distinguished
conduct involving combat with an enemy.
In 1963, Congress again changed the criteria, now requiring that
the medal only be given in cases where there are at least two
witnesses, including an officer. That requirement, according to
some of the 163 living recipients who are in Saratoga Springs this
week for their society's annual convention, has prevented many
soldiers and sailors not receiving the medal even though their acts
of bravery warranted the award.
Williams, 74, earned his medal on Feb. 23, 1945, while serving
as a corporal in the Marines on Iwo Jima. Covered by only four
riflemen, Williams volunteered to take out Japanese machine gun
posts that were preventing his division from advancing. In one
instance during his four-hour ordeal, Williams mounted a pillbox
and inserted the nozzle of his flamethrower through an air vent to
kill the occupants who were firing on his unit.
