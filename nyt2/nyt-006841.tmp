T. Rowe Price International Stock fund's $10.6 billion in assets
has forced it to own a large number of stocks, and lose
flexibility. But Steve Norwitz, a T. Rowe Price spokesman, said
size is not an issue because the fund owns large companies and is
diversified internationally.
By the shores of Lake Merced, the veteran from steamy Orlando,
Fla., birdied the final three holes as he came in early with a
stunning 4-under-par 66 in the first round of the US Open.
Mark Carnevale, who has made only four cuts in 14 PGA Tour
events this year, checked in with a bogey-free round of 67. Joe
Durant, who once was so discouraged that he quit the game and has
made just six cuts in 12 tournaments, walked at Carnevale's side
and posted a 69. That was later matched by Tom Lehman, who has led
this championship the last three years entering the final round but
has come up short every time.
Stewart, who won the 1991 US Open at Hazeltine in a playoff with
Simpson, took the past two weeks off and went to Aruba to film a
made-for-TV match with Nick Price, then settled by the pool at his
home in Florida. He was totally relaxed.
His round warmed up on the seventh hole when, from a terrible
lie in the rough, he hit into the fronting bunker and got it up and
down to save par. Then it heated up when he rolled in a downhill
putt from 40 feet on the eighth and made a 15-foot birdie putt on
the ninth to turn in 33.
Durant stirred things up when he birdied four of the first five
holes and, after a three-putt bogey on the sixth, hit a 9-iron into
the par-3 eighth and made a birdie to turn in 31. When he hit a
wedge into the 12th to within a foot, he was 5 under. Joe Durant?
He returned to earth with a three-putt double bogey on the 14th
but sank a 40-foot birdie putt on the 15th. Bogeys at 16 and 17
clouded his moment in the sun.
Embracing a trend that is rapidly reshaping the Internet, Walt
Disney Co. let it be known Thursday that the Tomorrowland of
cyberspace will be entered through a giant consumer gateway cobbled
with the gadgets of interactive technologies and the proven lure of
traditional media news, sports, entertainment and information.
On Thursday, Disney announced a complex deal valued at about
$900 million in which it will buy 43 percent of Infoseek, a service
that helps guide users to what they want on the World Wide Web. The
announcement capped two weeks of fevered developments across media
and technology industries that were too small to shake the
financial markets but obviously a trend that was too significant to
ignore.
Last week, General Electric's NBC unit struck a deal to take
control of Snap, an upstart online directory service, for up to $65
million in cash and more than $100 million in free television
promotions.
