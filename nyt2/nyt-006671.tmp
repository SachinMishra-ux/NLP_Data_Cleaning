Every topic that touches on Indian-white contact is ripe for
gibes, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to television to casinos
even.
In three paintings by Harry Fonseca (Maidu) done from 1987 to
1993, Coyote turns up as a vaudeville Uncle Sam, a hipster in a
black leather jacket and a saint surrounded by clouds and flowers.
NEW YORK The mournful tableaux of white plaster figures fitted
into diners, subway cars or telephone booths produced by George
Segal in the 1960s earned him a permanent niche in the history of
Pop Art. But he was not content to confine his vision to that
genre, and in later years he tackled other worlds and bigger
themes.
The retrospective of Segal's work now on view at the Jewish
Museum is determined to prove that he was more than just a Pop
artist; it presents him as a humanist able to address difficult
historical topics or deep religious themes. He also appears as a
playful traditionalist doing variations on Cezanne or Cubism and,
in a series of late portrait drawings, as a follower of Rembrandt.
Of the 42 works on view, only three or four are in the style for
which Segal is best known. But the problem is that those remain his
most convincing works. The original show, organized by Marco
Livingstone for the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, had 71 works;
this was whittled down to fit the tighter confines of the Jewish
Museum.
Segal, who was born in 1924, was in his late 30s when, in 1961,
he discovered the possibilities of casting human bodies in plaster.
Before that, he had been a brushy, figurative painter mixing
influences from Matisse and Abstract Expressionism, and he had made
some roughly modeled plaster figures that he posed in front of his
paintings. At the same time, he was working in New Jersey as a
chicken farmer and later as a schoolteacher.
At one point, Segal realized he didn't have to make everything
with his own hands but could work as an assemblagist, arranging
things he had found into theatrical situations. Other artists,
including Robert Rauschenberg, Edward Kienholz and Segal's friend
Allan Kaprow, who staged his first Happening at Segal's farm, were
already moving in this direction. In Segal's case, it was a
breakthrough and was what made his figures so striking.
Constructed from thin plaster shells made by applying medical
plaster-impregnated bandages to real people, the figures are more
like found objects than expressive representations. And when
they're placed in settings built from real-world materials, the
effect is uncanny.
There's a resonant ambiguity about these figures. They're blank
but emotionally fraught, specific but anonymous, ordinary but
strange. And there's a melancholy romance in these scenes that
calls to mind the paintings of Edward Hopper.
Segal's sculptural portraits, like a full-figure cast of his
dealer Sidney Janis (1967), posed looking at a simulated Mondrian
on a wooden easel, are problematic in another way. The technique
doesn't allow nuanced responses to personality, and the sculptures
look like what they are: inert shells of real people.
