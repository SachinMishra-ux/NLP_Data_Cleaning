For the Assembly Democrats, especially Speaker Sheldon Silver,
the session went much as it did for Pataki. They, too, calculated
that there was not much they needed, politically. They, too,
entered the year with a limited agenda, and in defeat found
election-year ammunition.
Pataki's broad budget vetoes in April denied the Democrats much
of what they wanted, including a $500 million increase in spending
on school construction and a tripling of spending on child care.
Silver refused to negotiate with Pataki and the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, on restoring some of the vetoed items, saying
it was all or nothing.
From the start, the speaker made it clear that he would rather
have the issue to use against Pataki than have a fraction of the
money back. And as the session ended, Silver kept up his attacks on
the governor with an eye toward the November election.
The Assembly Democrats called for steps to reduce New York's
auto insurance rates, knowing well that the Republicans would
reject them. Again, even before the session had ended, the defeat
had become a campaign issue, as the Democrats running against the
governor piggy-backed on the Assembly's plans and blamed Pataki for
high premiums.
It was telling that when asked what he considered the major
achievement of the session, Silver cited not a piece of
legislation, but a process: the negotiation of a budget through
public conference committees with the Senate, rather than in
private talks.
Somewhat obscured by the furor over the vetoes was the
Democrats' achievement of some of the things they wanted most this
year, including a large increase in basic school aid, expansion of
the state's health care program for poor children, and a process
for people to appeal when their health insurance companies deny
coverage for certain treatments.
The Assembly passed a criminal-justice package that included the
governor's proposal to end parole, though it also included other
measures that Pataki and the Senate refused to accept. In the end,
no law was enacted, but the Democrats can go home and tell voters
that they, too, voted to abolish parole.
So attractive was that measure as a piece of political cover
that all the Republicans in the Assembly voted for it as well, for
fear that they would be accused of opposing the antiparole measure.
LYON, France In one of the wilder twists of the most
anticipated, and controversial, matchup of this World Cup, Iran
takes on its most-hated enemy of the last 20 years under the
leadership of a man who has enjoyed all the benefits of life within
the despised land.
Jalel Talebi, who seeks to guide the Iranians past the United
States tonight at Stade Gerland, has spent most of his time since
the Islamic revolution 19 years ago residing in the Bay Area, where
his sons were schooled, his wife runs a couple businesses, and he
has coached at the same junior college in which U.S. coach Steve
Sampson once played and coached.
