For many, the VW Bug is basic transportation. But, as Wijers
said, it's also a deeply ingrained feature of Mexican cultural
history.
Beetle sales last year in Mexico fell to 35,000. It may have
been the effects of the 1995 peso crisis, but Wijers theorized that
would-be Beetle buyers were waiting to see if the new model would
be in their price range.
Nevertheless, the $17,500 retail price of the new Beetle puts it
way out of the price range for most Mexicans.
North of the Rio Grande, too, the Beetle is not about affordable
transportation but about a lifestyle choice.
NEW YORK On a sunny morning last week, Bonnie Pressman sat in
her office on the 10th floor of a gleaming Fifth Avenue tower. The
black-matte telephone on her desk looked big enough to route the
calls of a small city, and it wouldn't stop beeping and mewling.
Two assistants hovered by the door, impatient to escort her to a
meeting, while the noise of a jackhammer rose from the street.
But Ms. Pressman, the executive vice president and fashion
director of Barneys New York, ignored the phone, asked an assistant
to shut the door and stalled the waiting suits in a conference
room.
Ms. Pressman belongs to the growing number of trendsetters on
the East and West Coasts high-profile people from the worlds of
fashion, entertainment and society who have taken passages to
India, following to their source the popular interest in yoga, the
writings of Deepak Chopra and the blissed-out look in fashion and
cosmetics. Although Ms. Pressman discovered India through a medical
emergency, many others seem simply to be carried on the winds of
the latest trend.
When Marie-Anne Oudejans, the designer who founded the fashion
house Tocca, abruptly resigned two months ago, surprising the
fashion world and leaving no forwarding number, it was to Udaipur
that she disappeared for 10 days. The junior jet setter Lulu de
Kwiatkowski visited India in the spring, and Stephan de
Kwiatkowski, her brother, goes once a year. The models Kate Moss
and Naomi Campbell stored up reserves of equanimity in Rajasthan
for the hectic ready-to-wear shows in March. Ms. Campbell was
accompanied by Didier Fernandez, a booker who until recently worked
at Elite.
Of course, Western fascination with Indian culture has gone in
cycles for a long time. Ever since Alexander the Great marched into
northern India in 326 B.C. to persuade a yogi to return to Greece
with him (the yogi declined, preferring instead to immolate himself
on a funeral pyre), Westerners have periodically sought yogic
counsel. The potential threat of nuclear jousting between Pakistan
and India does not seem to have dimmed the latest cultural
infatuation.
The most hard-core recent visitors Sting, the director Andre
Gregory, the actors Meg Ryan and Betty Buckley, the Hong Kong
clothing impresario Joyce Ma and the social figure Anne Dexter
Jones are devotees not only of India, but also of the ashram
experience.
