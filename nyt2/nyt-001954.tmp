One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
But it's worth it financially enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
