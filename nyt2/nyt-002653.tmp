Shelby's remarks, his first public comment on the subject,
echoed findings of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
last year concluded that Beijing had tried to influence American
elections. But that committee, headed by Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn., also uncovered scant evidence that the plan had been
carried out.
Shelby's committee hearings last week were the first formal
congressional sessions on the China Plan, as it is known, since the
disclosure that Johnny Chung, a Democratic Party fund-raiser, had
told Justice Department investigators that a large portion of the
nearly $100,000 that he raised for the Democrats came from an
official with close ties to the Chinese army.
The money came from Liu Chaoying, a Chinese army lieutenant
colonel who also is an official of a Chinese aerospace company. Her
father was a high-ranking general and Communist Party official.
Shelby's hearings were the first of a number of planned
congressional inquiries into accusations concerning campaign
fund-raising and the Clinton administration's decision-making
process in allowing the launching of civilian American satellites
on Chinese rockets.
The Justice Department is looking into Chung's disclosures along
with whether two satellite makers Loral Space and Communications
and Hughes Electronics illegally gave China space expertise that
allowed Beijing to more accurately aim its nuclear missiles. The
issue of the transfer of technology arose after a Chinese rocket
carrying a $200 million Loral satellite was launched in China on
Feb. 15, 1996, and exploded seconds later.
China asked Loral and some experts from Hughes to conduct an
independent review of the accident. It was in the course of the
review that some administration officials raised questions about
how much information had been turned over to the Chinese.
Bernard Schwartz, the Loral chairman, contributed more than $1
million to Democratic political campaigns in the last election.
Schwartz and other Loral officials denied the donations were an
effort to influence administration decisions on Loral's satellite
deal.
Last week, the intelligence committee uncovered evidence of
conflicting views on the subject within the administration. A CIA
review concluded that the companies had not disclosed information
to China that damaged national security. But an intelligence arm of
the State Department found that the disclosure had placed American
security interests at risk.
ALBANY, N.Y. If only Bertrand Russell had known about the
meetings of the Assembly Rules Committee, he might never have had
to invent the bald king of France.
The committee does have members; indeed, its 26 Democrats and 12
Republicans make it the Legislature's largest. It also has
responsibilities, in fact, arguably more than any other Assembly
committee. During the last few frenzied weeks of a session, when
most legislation finally reaches the floor for a vote, it is up to
the Rules Committee to set the agenda. It has the power to move a
bill forward or, just as significant, hold one back, thereby
killing it.
