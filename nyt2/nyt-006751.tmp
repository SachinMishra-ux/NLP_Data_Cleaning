Issuer or listing fees typically include a hefty initial charge
when a company lists its shares, an annual fee and additional
charges if a company issues new shares of stock. Exchanges usually
base their fees on how many shares a company has outstanding.
Regardless of a company's size, fees are highest on the New York
Stock Exchange and lowest on the American Stock Exchange.
On the Big Board, for instance, a company with 5 million to 6
million shares outstanding would pay an annual charge of at least
$16,170. On the American Stock Exchange, it would pay $9,000. On
Nasdaq, it would pay $12,000, up 54 percent from the $7,750 charged
last year.
Although this may seem like pocket change, these fees can be a
significant cost of doing business for the small concerns that have
made Nasdaq their home because they do not meet the Big Board's
more stringent listing requirements or do not want to pay its high
fees.
And the annual fees come on top of Nasdaq's original listing
fees of almost $60,000 for a firm of that size. Original listing
charges for such a firm would be as much as $88,100 on the Big
Board and $27,500 on the American Stock Exchange.
Not surprisingly, the bigger the exchange, the more important
listing fees are to its overall financial picture. Last year, for
example, 41 percent of the New York Stock Exchange's revenues came
from listing fees: $261 million in total.
Nasdaq's issuer fees totaled $113 million in 1997, 18 percent of
its revenues. The American Stock Exchange took in $16 million in
such fees, 8 percent of its total revenues.
But companies that list their shares on Nasdaq have experienced
the heftiest increase in fees. According to a study that Healy
conducted for his clients, Nasdaq's listing fees increased by
almost 500 percent from 1990 through 1997.
Only a small portion of the increase can be attributed to more
listing companies: The number of issuers rose only 34 percent
during the period. Most of the growth in issuer revenues came from
price increases.
Nasdaq said that it had to increase its issuer fees to cover new
information services including its World Wide Web site and online
services developed for issuers and investors. The fee increase
also went toward investment in technology for Nasdaq's market
surveillance system.
Because its fees remain below those on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nasdaq says its charges are reasonable. But comparisons
with the Big Board are irrelevant to most of its issuers because
most do not meet the New York Stock Exchange's listing requirements
and therefore could not list their shares there.
