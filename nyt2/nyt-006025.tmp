Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
More often they're used by the military to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
