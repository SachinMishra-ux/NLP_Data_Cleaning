Roy (Robert Skjaerstad) is a furtive, sullen, thoroughly
miserable fellow. He's a postman, but you can forget the old
rain-snow-dark-of-night bit. When his bag gets too heavy, he simply
dumps the excess mail in a railway tunnel. Nor is he beyond
relieving his boredom by steaming open his customers' letters and
looking into their lives.
When a young woman, Line (Andrine Saether), forgetfully leaves
her apartment keys dangling in her mailbox lock, Roy can't help
himself. He snatches them, sneaks upstairs and invades her home,
snooping through her cupboards, stealing a photo of her from a
scrapbook and, most intriguingly, stumbling across a plastic trash
sack filled with cash.
He is, in fact, taking a nap when Line returns. Hiding beneath
her bed, he's got a ringside seat for her attempted suicide. After
a moment's indecision, Roy pulls the unconscious woman from her
bath, phones rescuers, then flees before they arrive.
But having saved Line's life, Roy feels weirdly obligated to her and romantically stirred. Before long he is defending the young
woman from her venal boyfriend, George (Per Egil Aske). The money
in the bag is a result of George's criminal activities, and when it
turns up missing, Roy has to play the hero.
No wonder Roy decides to risk his neck to save Line. What with
the deadly dull world around him, flirting with death may be the
only way he'll ever feel alive.
Dedee, played with sneering voluptuousness by Christina Ricci,
doesn't like movie cliches. But then Dedee doesn't like much of
anything, including those of us in the audience, whom she addresses
with undisguised contempt.
This prime slice of 16-year-old trailer-court trash is the most
outrageous character in writer//director Don Roos' comedy of bad
manners, but she manages to bring out edgy behavior in just about
everyone she encounters.
As the film begins she's run away from her Louisiana home (after
desecrating the grave of her molesting stepfather) and high-tailed
it to Indiana to pay an unannounced visit to her older half-brother
Bill (Martin Donovan), whom she has seen only once before.
Immediately zeroing in on the weakest person in sight, she gets
to work on the slow-witted Matt, bullying him into exploring his
latent heterosexuality.
Before long Dedee has fled with Matt to California after
cleaning out Bill's bank account. The jilted Bill and Lucia give
chase, only to discover the very swollen Dedee cheating on Matt
with her old boyfriend from Louisiana, a violence-prone Christian
fundamentalist (William Scott Lee).
