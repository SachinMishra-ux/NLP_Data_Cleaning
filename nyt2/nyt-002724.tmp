Mike Fetters, the A's fourth reliever of the day, might indeed
have been throwing at Benitez. He might even have been mad that
David Dellucci had legged out a double earlier in the eighth after
the score was already 12-4. But Fetters made a strong argument that
he did not plunk Benitez.
The way the A's saw it, that high-and-tight pitch to Kevin
Mitchell in the bottom of the eighth should have been enough of an
answer to any perceived offense Fetters committed. Mitchell got out
of the way but dropped his bat and sprawled to the ground. Mitchell
didn't think Amaury Telemaco's inside offering was aimed at him,
but he also didn't think much of the Diamondbacks going after
Grieve.
The chest-thumping and war of words might serve to fire up an
A's team that looked in danger of going flat. The loss brought
their only three-game home winning streak of the season to a
screeching halt. They headed to Los Angeles for a three-game series
with the Dodgers that threatens to be punishment enough to kill any
optimism generated by the team's 3-2 homestand, just the second
winning homestand of the year.
The Diamondbacks (20-43) reached double digits in scoring for
only the second time this season, the other time coming April 20
against the Florida Marlins (17-44). That was mostly because
knuckleballer Tom Candiotti had to leave the game in the second
with back spasms, handing the ball over to the A's bullpen.
Jay Witasick, called up from Triple-A Edmonton on Thursday, gave
up a homer to the first batter he faced, Dellucci, and that pretty
much set the tone. He gave up three homers and six runs in his 31/3
innings. At least Witasick has some promise. It's hard to say the
same about Aaron Small or T.J. Mathews, the next two A's relievers
to squirt a little kerosene on the fire.
ELMONT, N.Y. Darkness was falling upon Barn 9. It was nearly
three hours after one of the greatest Belmont Stakes in memory, one
of the most exciting finishes that ever could be scripted, and Mike
Pegram was leaning against a fence post by the barn.
All the outward glitz of a party-to-be were there. More than 100
people were clumped here and there around Real Quiet's barn, a
whole caravan of white and black stretch limousines all with Real
Quiet placards on their sides were parked beyond the barn, and
even more were lined up near the Belmont training track a half-mile
away. But the party chatter was low, there had been tears and there
could be little joy.
Pegram's horse had run 1 1/2 miles and had finished an inch
short, a nose shy in the jargon of horse racing. Pegram, the
ever-present can of Bud Light in hand, still seemed in shock. He
and his horse had come within an inch of a Triple Crown.
Pegram seemed almost believable. But still he seemed in shock as
he went through the motions of posing with a fan with a camera here
or giving an autograph to another fan with a Belmont Stakes program
there. The flash would not go off for the fan with the camera;
Pegram gamely posed a second time.
But to lose the Belmont that way, to lose the Triple Crown in
that fashion, to see $5 million slip away when your horse has
opened 4, 5, and 6 lengths in the stretch only to lose it all by a
nose was the cruelest way to lose. Pegram's face showed it; his
words wouldn't.
