Ramos hopes to make an impact against Iran. Sampson has told him
he'll start in that game, probably in place of Ernie Stewart.
Frankie Hejduk, who nearly pulled the Americans even with a fine
header in the 53rd minute, also will be in the lineup, if one hears
the messages Sampson is sending; he'll step in for Mike Burns, as
he did at halftime on Monday. The other potential change from the
first-game lineup would be Roy Wegerle in place of Eric Wynalda,
but Sampson said Tuesday he has not yet made a determination on a
starting forward.
It was clear from the first minute how Germany planned to
neutralize the Americans take midfielder Claudio Reyna out of the
match and their plan worked to perfection.
Reyna, whom the Germans were familiar with from his work with
Bundesliga straggler VfL Wolfsburg, received a blow to the kidney
from Jens Jeremies just seconds into Monday's clash, and the 1860
Munich midfielder beat up on Reyna the rest of the night.
The biggest criticism of Reyna, widely considered the greatest
player the United States has produced, is that he doesn't like
physical play. Expect the Iranians and Yugoslavs to treat him in a
similar manner.
Winger Frankie Hejduk, the surfer-turned-soccer star who made
the biggest impact for the Americans on Monday, took a page from
baseball superstition and twisted it in an effort to overcome the
Germans.
Eric Wynalda, who didn't manage even a shot in 63 minutes as the
Americans' striker, says he knew things were going wrong almost
from then start.
As the 98th U.S. Open unfolds Thursday at The Olympic Club, the
ground has shifted, something that happens a lot in this town. The
guy with the goatee and wraparound sunglasses belongs inside the
ropes, not outside them. In fact, put David Duval not Tiger Woods at the top of golf's leader board.
For 12 months, since the previous U.S. Open at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Md., Duval has ruled the game like no
other. Check the win column. Check his bank statements.
Duval, 27, a Jacksonville, Fla., native and son of a Senior PGA
Tour player, carefully sidesteps the issue of whether he is golf's
top player now. But he didn't dismiss it.
Of course, Duval's absolute brilliance won't last forever. Golf
never permits anyone to get too comfortable or too cocky. The
latest reminder of this came when Woods hit his plateau, posting
merely reasonable success after an astonishing pro debut.
