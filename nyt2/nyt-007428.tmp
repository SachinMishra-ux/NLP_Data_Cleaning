Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
NEW YORK Like pilgrims at a sacred site, Dot Garabrant and her
friend Sadie Ciganeck stood outside the Lower East Side Tenement
Museum on Orchard Street, pointing to a collage of old-time
pictures of women in long dresses and fancy hats. The two had just
finished reading a novel about old New York something about a
woman who hailed from a line of healers. They had read the book.
Now it was time to do the city.
One hundred years after what was most likely an ordinary day in
the newly consolidated city, New York is marking its birthday this
weekend with scores of events across town. Unlike the big bashes of
past years the Bicentennial with its flotilla of elegant tall
ships, or the Statue of Liberty's century celebration with its
dazzling and deafening blast of fireworks in the harbor this
birthday was low-key and spread out.
The actual anniversary of the city's consolidation was on New
Year's Day, but organizers thought the summer's first weekend would
provide a natural opportunity to herald both history and warm
weather by piggybacking onto the many events that always take place
this time of year.
Marie Salerno, the president of NYC 100, which has organized a
yearlong series of events to mark the consolidation of the five
boroughs into Greater New York, said this weekend's idea was to
promote local pride. And if the neighborhood groups brought the
cake, she said, her group would light the candles with a
simultaneous five-borough fireworks show.
The weekend's theme had caught the fancy of Rafael Bueno, a
poet, philosopher and prime mover behind the gallery and its
adjacent community garden. Wearing tails and a ruffled shirt, he
was scruffily formal for a show at the gallery, an official
Centennial event. In the garden, he walked under a leafy canopy of
grape vines he wants to bottle the first Bronx vintage, he said.
He would also like to see the borough become to Latin Americans and
indigenous people what Harlem is for African Americans.
In Queens, history was on the march. So was science, home repair
and even Danielle Steel, as library workers carried boxes of books
from the old public library to the new Flushing branch Saturday
morning. Most people lining the eight-block parade route were
unaware of any real connection to the city's centennial. This was
just their chance to celebrate their own neighborhood, which
sometimes feels like a stepchild.
The neighborhood, like its library, has grown over the years,
and both reflect the rich mix of people who have come to call this
place home. The library collection includes items in 30 languages.
Videotapes and best-selling novels are the big favorites, although
Joanna Almeda said she thought of finding a book about how Queens
and Manhattan were united.
Which is not how some folks feel in Staten Island, where a
secessionist sentiment still smolders. Linda Gregori, 53, thinks
they never should have built the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, which
has joined her island to Brooklyn since 1964, never mind what
happened in 1898. It brought too much traffic, people and crime.
A century ago, that was the fear of Brooklynites who resisted
the city's consolidation amid fears that their bucolic town's charm
would vanish forever.
