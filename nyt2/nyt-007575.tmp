He hit a cyprus tree and made birdie. He buried a few balls in
the unkempt rough and slapped another into the grandstand and still
salvaged pars. He bent putts across double-sloped greens and danced
like he was at a Greatful Dead Concert when they lipped the cup and
dropped in.
But then the unreality and gravity of the Olympic Club Lake
Course finally began to exact its toll. Holding a five-stroke lead
at one point, Stewart slipped from 7-under to 3-under on the back
nine, capped by one of the strangest birdie attempts ever witnessed
by Stewart or anyone else.
Sitting pin-high with eight feet to go for a four-stroke lead,
Stewart's birdie try on 18 slipped around the hole, gently rolled
at an angle down the severe slope of the green and didn't stop
until he had a 25-footer coming back uphill. He missed, made bogey
and then ran up to the clubhouse with a slim one-stroke lead over
Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway.
Wearing his trademark plaid knickers and jaunty red cap, Stewart
certainly could not be mistaken for someone who was ready to
tighten up like the rest of the first-round leaders at the fabled
course. But the putt on 18 put a damper on his good vibrations,
which began with three straight birdies.
Washington state native Kirk Triplett had a similar putt not
long after Stewart's, and he stopped the ball from rolling back
with his putter an infraction that cost him a two-stroke penalty
and put him well out of contention to make the cut.
On the more normal side of the spectrum, the day also belonged
to button-downed 19-year-old U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar, who
had four birdies to go with one bogey, a double bogey and the rest
pars to finish the first two rounds at 1-under.
Kuchar, the Georgia Tech junior-to-be who captivated crowds with
his 21st-place finish at the Masters, served notice that he's no
fluke.
Kuchar was tied for third place with little-known Lee Porter and
Lee Janzen, whose 4-under-par 66 was the low score of the day.
Porter, of Greensboro, N.C., has spent as much time on the Asian
Tour as he has playing on the PGA Tour but managed to qualify for
his first Open this year. He capped his round with a 112-yard
pitching wedge shot for eagle on the par-4 18th, a shot he counts
among the most memorable of his life.
Maggert could understand Stewart's frustrations on a course in
which only four players have managed to break par over 72 holes in
three previous Opens held here in 1955, 1966 and 1987.
