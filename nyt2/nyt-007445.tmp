For example, Axelrod's collection of tens of thousands of
fossils showed him that the Sierra Nevada were once just gentle
foothills, with slopes rising no more than 2,000 feet. He also
found that the giant redwoods, lately living in California, were
once rooted in Nevada's ancient wet forestland.
Axelrod, who wrote about such topics as dinosaur extinction and
plate tectonics, was a founder of the discipline of paleobotany,
which uses fossils to recreate climates that existed millions of
years ago, said Dr. Jay Quade, director of the Desert Laboratory of
the University of Arizona in Tucson.
Axelrod figured out that today's plants of a dry Nevada evolved
from ancestral plants that lived in central Mexico long ago in a
zone like the Nevada desert of today.
Daniel Isaac Axelrod was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. He received all
his degrees from the University of California at Berkeley, his B.A.
in botany in 1933, and his M.A. and Ph.D., both in botany and
paleontology, in 1936 and 1938.
He served in the Army from 1942 to 1946, winning the Bronze Star
for his work in photographic intelligence in the Philippines.
In 1946, Axelrod joined the University of California at Los
Angeles, moved to the Davis campus in 1967 and became an emeritus
professor there in 1976.
He is survived by his wife, Marilyn Gayler Axelrod; a son, Peter
Axelrod, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Hillary Dion
Gayler, of Davis; a sister, Dorothy Heller Axelrod, of Arcata,
Calif.; and a brother, Walter Axelrod, of Rainbow, Calif.; and one
grandchild.
LYONS, France It is great that the Clinton administration
wants to reconcile with Iran, Alexi Lalas said. He and his U.S.
teammates will shake hands with Iran's players before Sunday's game
and exchange jerseys afterward. But this is the World Cup, and
politics must take a backseat to soccer, he said. Ultimately, it is
more urgent to win the game than to win new friends.
Without a victory over Iran, the United States (0-1) has almost
no chance of advancing to the second round of the World Cup. And
yet anything less would mean disappointment and a failure to match
its accomplishments during the 1994 World Cup. In fact, the
Americans not only need to beat Iran, they will also very likely
need to win by at least two goals, given the tie breaker formula
used to determine which teams advance in soccer's world
championship tournament.
Because his team needs goals, and because it is looking to
relieve the timidity that accompanied its 2-0 loss to Germany last
Monday, Coach Steve Sampson has called for more risk taking and
assertiveness in the team's attack. He may even abandon the 3-6-1
formation, with its lone forward, in favor of two forwards. If so,
he could either start Eric Wynalda and Roy Wegerle up front, or
perhaps start Wynalda with Tab Ramos as a withdrawn forward.
