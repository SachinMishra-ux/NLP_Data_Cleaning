This second shelter experience in 1995 offered the guarantee of
at least the basic necessities of life for 30 days that came and
went too soon.
But there was no rest there. My now-2-year-old had developed kid
ney disease. Her fever was high and she was swollen head to toe. I
had to take her to the hospital immedi ately, after midnight and
with a groggy 8-year-old old in tow. My old vehicle by now had two
gears left, no air-conditioning, and over heated every seven miles
like clock work.
It finally gave out on one of these runs to the clinic a day
I'll never forget.
It was July, the height of the summer heat, with a feverish baby
and a confused 8-year-old. And when it broke down that day, I
suppose I did, too tears rolling down my face, unable to move,
car horns blaring at me, drivers cursing at me, my children looking
scared I gave up in the middle of Alma School Road.
With one I called the clinic to say the baby would be late.
Another I gave to my 8-year-old, hoping it would make her feel
better. The other I used to call my ex.
I spent hours on the phone or in transit to appointments,
filling out form after form, existing in waiting rooms with hungry,
restless chil dren.
When my time was up at the shelter after 30 days, I had nowhere
to go, no provisions, no working vehicle, no housing and $270 a
month on which to survive with two children.
Society seemed to disregard that I didn't get to be a battered
woman by choice.
I felt awkward, undeserving and self-conscious among the
married, the housed, the fed, the insured, the secure.
A friend offered to let me and the children stay with her for a
week. When the week was up, she gave me enough money for a U-haul
truck to put my few belongings in storage.
