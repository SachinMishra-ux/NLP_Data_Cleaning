A rugged man of the West who prized independence and freedom, he
could not march to the beat tapped out by Jerry Falwell, Pat
Robertson and their brethren who would have government dictate
private conduct.
Goldwater once said in an interview that among the men who had
served in the White House during his years in politics he most
admired Harry Truman. Although they differed drastically on the
role government should play in the lives of the people, he liked
Truman's honesty and integrity and the way he spoke his mind.
In the contentious summer of 1974, it was Goldwater who was
chosen by his fellow Republicans to inform Nixon that if he did not
resign, he would be convicted in the Senate of impeachment charges
voted by the House.
Although he was a staunch Republican, he prized his friendship
with John Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey and other Democrats in the
Senate.
Some of us who covered his campaign wondered if Goldwater really
wanted to be president. He did and said so many things that a man
lusting for the Oval Office would not do and say.
But he was a stubborn old desert rat who was determined to be
candid with the voters even if him cost him the presidency.
Goldwater, as president, probably would have tried to abolish
many of the New Deal reforms that people had come to cherish and
depend on. And he would have failed.
HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. Inside the laboratory of Drs. Garth
and Nancy Nicolson, a freezer is cracked open and a cloud of frosty
vapor slowly dissolves to reveal row after row of metal boxes, the
boxes filled with vials, the vials in turn filled with the blood of
Gulf War veterans and their families.
A few of those vials are being shipped to laboratories in an
attempt to support or debunk one of the most controversial theories
of Gulf War illness.
They have treated a number of veterans, their families and their
own daughter with long-term antibiotic therapy.
