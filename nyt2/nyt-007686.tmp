A man and a woman sat halfway out of their car windows and
swayed to the American rock music that blared from their car.
Another man climbed up a 20-foot lamppost as the crowd cheered and
uniformed and plainclothes police officers and army troops looked
on.
Old men strolled the streets in nightshirts. Some women waved
flares and pounded on cars, ordering drivers to honk their horns
and cheer. Other women went out on their balconies wearing only
nightgowns and slippers.
In south central Tehran, a woman handed out sweets to strangers
for what she called a dual celebration.
It was not a night for gloating. One Iranian woman stopped and
kissed an American visitor, assuring her that the victory was
nothing personal; another invited the visitor to her home for a
meal. President Mohammed Khatami sent a message of congratulations
to the Iranian team.
The impromptu celebration was reminiscent of though much
smaller than the street celebrations marking Iran's draw with
Australia late last year, which qualified Iran for the World Cup
finals for the first time in 20 years. At that time, masses of
Iranians left their jobs and their homes for exultant
demonstrations.
This time, Iranian authorities took precautions to prevent any
celebrations or mourning from turning violent. Restaurants in
Tehran were forced to close at 9 p.m. Sports centers were ordered
to cancel plans to show the game on giant outdoor screens, and army
troops and plainclothes policemen were stationed at roadblocks
throughout the city.
Throughout this soccer-crazed country, Iranians were riveted to
their television screens from the starting kickoff at 11:30 p.m.,
cheering and grumbling as they watched.
To ensure that the coverage was Islamically correct, the
broadcast began seven seconds late, so that Iranian viewers would
not be subjected to the sight of fans in summer dress who might be
drinking alcoholic beverages.
When Hamid Reza Estili known as the James Bond of Iran scored the first goal, Iranians throughout Tehran were
thunderstruck. For one glorious moment, they had overtaken the
United States on at least one playing field.
Although Iranian officials greeted conciliatory words about Iran
this week by President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright with reserve, many Iranian citizens were delighted, a
delight that was magnified in the magic moment after Iran scored.
