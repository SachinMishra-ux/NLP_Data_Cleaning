WASHINGTON Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions. It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour not including the crew of 26 can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies. And as a precaution, bottled
water is being flown for the president and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton to drink and bathe.
The president will take along his own car, too an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet.
Nine other armored limos will also be flown ahead to transport
various high-ranking officials accompanying the president.
Also flying ahead will be a pair of sport utility vehicles used
by the U.S. Secret Service agents who protect the president.
He will also take his own private telephone company banks of
switching and transmission gear must be transported and set up days
ahead of time for each stop he'll make so that the president can
talk with international leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere
around the world without worrying that someone else might be
listening. All told, it's estimated the White House will be taking
60 tons of communications gear.
