The one person to realize this was the then-prime minister and
Keynesian economist Kiichi Miyazawa, back in 1992. But, as he said
on a recent television program, his proposal then for the
government to step in decisively to rescue bank loans already
turning sour because of collapsing asset values was derided on
every side, and by the business community especially.
In particular, we had the unbelievably foolish attempt late last
year to introduce an item that had long been high on the Finance
Ministry agenda, namely, a long-term program of severe fiscal
restraint at precisely the moment when the economy needed fiscal
expansion.
Meanwhile, U.S. experts were urging their favorite agenda item,
massive tax cuts in a nation where high savings propensity and
current pessimism guarantee that such cuts will simply end up as
extra savings, which is the last thing needed by Japan's
demand-starved economy.
Fortunately, the politicians have at last begun to stop
listening to these experts. Firm action to expand government
spending and rescue the banking system is at last being promised.
These moves may be in time to rescue the economy. But things
would have been much better, for Japan and the rest of Asia, if
they had come in 1992.

SAN FRANCISCO Aching back and all, Fred Couples on Tuesday
said he likes his chances to win the 98th U.S. Open. In his bag, he
carries course familiarity. He might be 800 miles from his
birthplace, but he feels at home at The Olympic Club.
The 38-year-old golfer, still fighting the back stiffness that
has plagued him much of the past four years, spent long sessions on
the driving range before and after a five-hour practice round. He
was all business, rifling iron shot after iron shot toward the
ocean.
Yet Couples paused long enough to ponder an August return to
Seattle for the PGA Championship, the likely discontinuation of his
hometown charity tournament after three years and life after his
father's death.
Couples expects his PGA appearance at Sahalee Country Club to be
highly emotional, one marking his first competitive appearance
before friends and relatives. Tenative plans have him arriving
early for the major tournament and playing a few extra rounds in
Redmond, then staying over and relaxing with those closest to him.
