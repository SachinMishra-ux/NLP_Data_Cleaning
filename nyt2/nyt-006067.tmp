But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom and her
new husband should sit in the first pew. Dad and his new wife should sit in the next pew.
If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar and makes life easier for the wedding consultant but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women even all
children if you like.
