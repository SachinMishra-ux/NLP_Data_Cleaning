The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
