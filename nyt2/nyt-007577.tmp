CLINTON-TRIP-1STLEDE When he visits China beginning next week,
virtually everything President Clinton does every step he takes,
every place he goes, every bite he eats will have been
choreographed weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women
who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending
hours studying videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret
Service agents will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and
air ducts blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting
bombs. His armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead.
Hotels will have been comandeered for the president and his
entourage. Detailed briefing books will have been prepared for him,
providing classified information on the ranking officials with whom
he will meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the
traveling White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will
have been installed so the media can beam images back to the United
States. In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around
the clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make
sure the whole thing goes off without a hitch. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
EDS: Originally moved Saturday and is being updated Sunday with
additional information for those who did not already run it.
BANKRUPTCY WASHINGTON By setting aside tobacco legislation
that would have increased costs for smokers, the Senate cleared the

people whose debts are driving them into bankruptcy.
Unlike the tobacco debate, which barely touched on smokers'
responsibility for their habits, the debate over tightening
bankruptcy rules is likely to focus on consumers' responsibility
for paying their bills.
