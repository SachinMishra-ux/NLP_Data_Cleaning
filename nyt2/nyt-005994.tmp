Similarly with the economy generally. It has long been obvious
that no economy, not even Japan's, could stand a sudden collapse of
the grossly inflated asset values built up during Japan's bubble
economy of the early '90s.
Worse, once the collapse got under way there was every chance
that it would spiral. Even interest rates at close to zero would
not stop the rot.
The one person to realize this was the then-prime minister and
Keynesian economist Kiichi Miyazawa, back in 1992. But, as he said
on a recent television program, his proposal then for the
government to step in decisively to rescue bank loans already
turning sour because of collapsing asset values was derided on
every side, and by the business community especially.
In particular, we had the unbelievably foolish attempt late last
year to introduce an item that had long been high on the Finance
Ministry agenda, namely, a long-term program of severe fiscal
restraint at precisely the moment when the economy needed fiscal
expansion.
Meanwhile, U.S. experts were urging their favorite agenda item,
massive tax cuts in a nation where high savings propensity and
current pessimism guarantee that such cuts will simply end up as
extra savings, which is the last thing needed by Japan's
demand-starved economy.
Fortunately, the politicians have at last begun to stop
listening to these experts. Firm action to expand government
spending and rescue the banking system is at last being promised.
These moves may be in time to rescue the economy. But things
would have been much better, for Japan and the rest of Asia, if
they had come in 1992.

TOKYO As the yen continues to fall, experts worldwide say it
is due to severe loss of confidence in the Japanese economy. In
Japan, the experts say it is Nippon uri, or the selling out of
Japan.
With the official discount rate stuck at 0.5 percent, and many
depositors in Japan getting less than 1 percent interest for their
money, it was inevitable that they would eventually begin to look
abroad. When they did, it was inevitable that the yen would begin
to weaken.
