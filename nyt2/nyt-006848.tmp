Man, this decade has been on the way back for so long, I can't
wait until it finally gets here. So we can jab a stake through its
heart.
Or drown it in Billy Beer. Or coat it in Jovan Musk Oil for Men.
Whatever it takes to kill the '70s.
KC, Your Boogie Man, must've tripped on his Boogie Shoes and
smacked his head while (Shake, Shake, Shake) Shaking His Booty
because he was so wrong.
Only 14 months ago, after time out for basketball and broken
legs, she started competing again in track and field. Two months
later, she won national championships in the 100-meter dash and the
long jump. Two months after that, she won those events in the world
championships in Athens.
Here, in the U.S championships Friday through Sunday, she is
favored to win three titles the 100 and 200 meters and the long
jump. That Jesse Owens-Carl Lewis type of triple was last
accomplished in the women's competition by Stella Walsh in 1948.
It also keeps it scary because the three rounds of the 100, the
three rounds of the 200 and the long jump are crammed into three
days. Saturday can be especially hazardous, with the 100 final at 7
p.m., Eastern time; the long jump at 8 and the 200 quarterfinals at
8:50.
She has been a star from the time she entered her teens, and in
1992 she made the U.S. Olympic team as a relay alternate. But her
mother thought it was too much too soon for a 15-year-old, so the
daughter stayed home.
North Carolina won the battle of college recruiters by allowing
her to double in track and basketball. She became the fastest point
guard alive, but in the summer of 1995 she broke her left foot
playing basketball and in January 1996 she broke it again doing a
long-jump drill on a trampoline. She missed the 1996 track season,
watching the Olympics from the same place as in 1992 in front of
a television set. She finished her senior year of basketball, then
had to make a choice.
This year, she is the world leader in the 100 meters (10.71
seconds), the 200 (21.94 seconds) and the long jump (23 feet 11 3/4
inches). The respective world records for those events are 10.49
and 21.34 seconds, both by Florence Griffith Joyner of the United
States, and 24 feet 8 1/4 inches by Galina Chistyakova of the
Soviet Union. All three records were set in 1988.
The Grand Prix meet scheduled for July 25 in Durham, N.C., has
been moved to Edwardsville, Ill., and will be called the U.S. Open:
Track and Field's Farewell to JJK. JJK is 36-year-old Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, who was raised in that area and is retiring after
three Olympic gold medals and five world records in the heptathlon
and the long jump.
