Even before this speech, it was often said that the prosecutor's
moral sense was unusually developed: he had grown up as the son of
a conservative minister in small-town Texas; he had never smoked or
drunk or cursed.
It was also said that his lifestyle exuded disciplined devotion:
his teenage hobby was shoe-polishing and his summer job was selling
Bibles; and, though he is busy these days, he likes to rise early
and jog to a creek near his house, where he pauses to sing a hymn
and pray.
It is not surprising, Starr says, that even though 25 out of 42
presidents have been lawyers, the profession is held in contempt
these days. One of the candidates in the Washington, D.C., mayoral
primary is campaigning on the fact that he is not a lawyer.
The unwavering pursuit of truth should indeed animate
prosecuting lawyers like himself; but if you run Starr's general
argument by Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor at the University of
Pennsylvania who is America's leading legal ethicist, you get an
interesting reaction.
Even though no lawyer should be party to perjury, defense
counsels have a duty to impede the search for truth in other ways.
They may advise their clients to invoke the Constitution's Fifth
Amendment, which means they can refuse to testify. They may argue
that incriminating evidence is inadmissible on technical grounds.
Even if they know their client to be guilty, defense lawyers are
supposed to pick holes in the prosecution's arguments, and to get
their clients off.
A lawyer's first duty is to the client, not to the truth,
because the alternative is terrible. If lawyers refuse to defend
clients whom they suspect to be guilty, then some defendants will
appear in court without a lawyer. If suspects know that lawyers may
desert them, they will not be able to confide in them and so
prepare a good defense.
The right to a fair trial cannot exist without defense lawyers
devoted to the business of defending. It is for judges and juries and prosecutors to worry about truth.
When Starr himself was defending tobacco companies some years
ago, and signing briefs arguing that nicotine might not be
addictive, he seemed to understand that the quest for truth must be
balanced against the rights of defendants.
