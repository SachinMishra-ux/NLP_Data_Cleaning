There's no denying that RFK was a man of great compassion and
insight, particularly when it came to those who were shortchanged
by society. One of his fondest dreams was to bridge the gaps that
separate Americans by race, class and even political philosophy.
If he'd achieved that dream, we might be saying now that nobody
cared what else he did or didn't do.

Adopting the statement on submission of women would be another
example of the extreme rightward swing of the 15.9 million-member
Southern Baptist Convention the nation's largest Protestant
group.
Also, it would show the dramatic differences between moderates
and conservatives in the denomination. Not that the two factions
aren't already irrevocably split.
The moderates, following their ouster from power in the 1980s,
have formed their own organization, called the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship, which, in effect, already is a separate denomination.
Whether one is a conservative or a moderate, though, statements
about women submitting to their husbands likely will be a
controversial subject.
His election would also be an emphatic indication of how
conservative the Southern Baptist denomination has become.
Patterson spearheaded the conservative revolution of the 1980s and
now is president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Wake Forest, N.C.
Ironically, Patterson's wife, Dorothy Patterson, is one of the
most powerful women in the denomination. She is an author, editor
of a popular Woman's Study Bible published by Thomas Nelson, and a
popular teacher and speaker throughout the denomination.
Russell Dilday of Fort Worth, a leading moderate and president
of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, which is separately
governed from the national convention, said the desire to add a
statement supporting families is commendable.
