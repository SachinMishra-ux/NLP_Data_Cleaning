If that happens, the Nizris don't know what they would do. Far
from the stereotype of the settler armed with a machine gun and a
mission to reclaim the land of the Bible and prevent a Palestinian
state, the Nizris might move north to the Galilee region or south
to the Negev Desert.
Or they may stay near Ofra in their tiny home with their
3-month-old baby, bean bags on the floor and wooden Indian carvings
on the wall.
ELMONT, N.Y. -- Bob Baffert figures he's done all he can do to
prepare Real Quiet for today's rendevous with history. Now, he just
has to hang loose and wait.
That wait will end late this afternoon when Real Quiet enters
the starting gate for the 130th Belmont Stakes, the 1{-mile test of
the champion.
If the skinny bay colt with a crooked leg manages to win, Real
Quiet will become only the 12th horse ever to wear the Triple Crown
and the first in two decades. Affirmed was the last to accomplish
this Herculean task, 20 years ago to the day.
A victory would be worth $5.6 million to a horse that cost only
$17,000, a bargain Cinderella that Baffert nicknamed the Fish
because of his long and narrow build. Now, the Fish has turned into
a shark, ready to devour his 12 opponents.
Those gods have been smiling a lot on Team Baffert. After early
forecasts for thunderstorms, today's weather is expected to be
breezy and warm under sunny skies. A crowd of 70,000 is expected to
come out to root for Real Quiet, Baffert and owner Mike Pegram.
Several critics have blasted Real Quiet, winner of only four of
14 starts, as unworthy of the Triple Crown. But Baffert ignores
them.
No Baffert fans will be rooting harder for Real Quiet than Bob
and Beverly Lewis, the owners of Silver Charm. The Newport Beach
couple flew to New York to watch another of their horses, Baquero,
compete on Belmont Day's stakes-heavy undercard. But they say
they'd like nothing better than to see Real Quiet do what Silver
Charm couldn't.
The Indian government said it they exploded five nuclear
devices, and the Pakistanis six, in underground tests between May
11 and May 30. Seismic waves from those explosions rippled through
the Earth's crust, and some were detected by seismographs hundreds
and thousands of miles away.
