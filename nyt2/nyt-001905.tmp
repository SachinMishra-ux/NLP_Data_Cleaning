The biggest naming-rights deal in the country is the $100
million over 20 years that Staples Office Supply will pay for
having its name affixed to the new Staples Center in Los Angeles.
Brenner noted that the deal is so high because three professional
sports teams the Clippers and Lakers of the National Basketball
Association and the Kings of the National Hockey League will play
in the Staples Center.
The figure for the new Mariners stadium is in the same ballpark
with the new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco ($2.08 million a
year), the new Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix ($2.2 million) and the
remodeled Edison International Field in Anaheim ($2.5 million).
Those naming-rights deals all were consummated within the past
year.
Having the naming rights deal completed now allows the Mariners
to fully market other lucrative areas of the new ballpark, in
particular the 79 corporate suites, 352 Diamond Club seats, 4,222
Terrace Club and 966 charter seat licenses it hopes to sell before
the new stadium opens in 1999.
Questions about the M's deal had been circulating for the past
several months in meetings with the Public Facilities District, the
agency set up to oversee construction and manage the money
collected from taxes and other sources for the stadium.
Armstrong acknowledged that the process might have seemed
laborious, but the team received more than two dozen inquiries from
interested companies. That number then was winnowed down to about
seven companies under serious consideration, but Armstrong declined
to disclose the runners-up.
The main issue for the team, he said, was Safeco's strong
presence in the community and the fact that it is a national
company with headquarters in Seattle. Brenner also noted the
importance for a company with naming rights to have a strong
presence in the region of the facility. Without that, the name
might face public resistance.
One recent case in point is the negative reaction the University
of Washington athletic department has received this week after
announcing that it had effectively sold naming rights to the
remodeled Hec Edmunson Pavilion to Seafirst Bank in a $9 million
sponsorship package. Another case is the renaming of Jack Murphy
Stadium in San Diego (named after a longtime local sportswriter) to
Qualcomm Stadium for the Qualcomm communications company.
DENVER Anyone who thinks that John Thomson's shutout of the
Diamondbacks at Bank One Ballpark on April 1 was a fluke, better
think again.
He was perfect through 4 innings and went on to scatter four
hits and strike out a career-high 11 as Colorado (26-34) salvaged a
split of the four-game series with a 5-2 victory at Coors Field.
It was the second-lowest hit total allowed by the Rockies staff
at Coors Field. It was the third straight victory for Thomson (5-5)
and the third complete game of his career.
