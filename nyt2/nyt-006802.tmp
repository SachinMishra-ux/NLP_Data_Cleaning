News of the agreement, which had been rumored since the start of
this week, caused Internet stocks to surge in early trading. But by
day's end, concerns over the structure of the deal had damped down
the enthusiasm of investors. Infoseek closed just 63 cents higher
at $35.13, while Disney fell $2.30 to $112.
Analyst Keith Benjamin of San Francisco's Robertson Stephens
said the expenses associated with the deal, including the $165
million, will probably mean that Infoseek, which has never posted a
profit, won't make money until 2001.
Disney and Infoseek officials said they will launch a portal
service later this year combining Starwave's technology with the
best from their existing services. The site, which will retain the
Infoseek name, will feature ABC.com, ABCNEWS.com, Disney.com,
ESPN.com and the official sites of the National Football League,
the National Basketball Association and NASCAR.
Infoseek is the third most popular search and directory service
behind Excite and top-ranked Yahoo. With Disney on board, Infoseek
officials hope to improve that position.
One potential problem for Infoseek is that yesterday's agreement
does not give it exclusive rights to Disney content. Disney also
provides material to other sites, including Excite and America
Online.
Infoseek said it will buy up the 3.1 million shares of Starwave
not owned by Disney, giving it complete control of the privately
owned Bellevue, Wash., company formerly controlled by Microsoft
founder Paul Allen.
The satellite, originally called Asiasat 3, was launched last
December to provide television and telephone service in Asia. But
the Russian-built launcher malfunctioned, leaving the satellite in
an unusable orbit. The satellite was declared a loss, and its
owner, a company based in Hong Kong, received a $200 million
insurance settlement.
Hughes took possession of what looked to be an expensive piece
of space junk. In April it began the seemingly improbably salvage
mission to send the satellite around the Moon, some 240,000 miles
away, and back to an Earth orbit.
The idea was to have the Moon's gravity provide some of the
energy needed to correct the satellite's orbit, which was inclined
at 51 degrees to the Equator. An ideal orbit would be directly over
the Equator.
In fact, Hughes ended up sending the satellite around the Moon a
second time, something it had not initially planned, to achieve an
even finer correction in the orbit.
