The power of the legislative leaders was clearly evident in
other intriguing ways, including the use of committees that
function as tools for the leaders of each house because they decide
which bills go to the floor for a vote and which bills are bottled
up.
That scenario played out Thursday at a meeting of the Assembly
Health Committee, where chairman Richard Gottfried was haphazardly
sending some bills to the floor and others to the legislative
purgatory of a committee run by Silver.
That got some committee members on the sidelines grumbling that
Silver was dictating the outcome. Sandra Galef, a Democratic
assemblywoman from Ossining, asked Gottfried to explain the logic
behind his decisions.
Bruce and Janice Grieshaber, a couple from Syracuse, found
themselves ensnared in a political fight in which they had only the
most tenuous connection.
The Grieshabers' daughter, Jenna, was killed in Albany last year
by a felon who was on parole, police say. Pataki seized upon the
case to urge the Legislature, particularly his Democratic rivals in
the Assembly, to end parole for violent felons.
Still the events left the Grieshabers filled with hope that a
measure to end parole would be approved after the differences were
bridged.
Frustrated and angry, the Grieshabers finally spoke out Thursday
afternoon, unexpectedly marching into the Capitol press room to
denounce Silver. They accused the speaker not only of bargaining in
bad faith but also of blocking a vote on the governor's plan, even
though there was widespread support in the Assembly.
ST.-DENIS, France If you glanced quickly at the field at the
end of Thursday night's game, there appeared to be little reason
for any French person to complain.
France had just won, 4-0, over Saudi Arabia to become the second
team to clinch a spot in the second round of the World Cup finals.
There at midfield, under the wonderfully theatrical oval opening in
the roof of the Stade de France, its players often treated with
ambivalence in their capital were basking in their newfound
popularity as the sellout crowd of nearly 80,000 roared.
But if you looked more closely, there was cause for pessimism.
There on the bench was French striker Christophe Dugarry with
crutches in both hands. Nowhere on the bench or the field was
Dugarry's friend Zinedine Zidane.
