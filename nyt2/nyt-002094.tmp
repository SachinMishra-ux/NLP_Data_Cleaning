Wagner's training partner, Mark Boswell, also was disappointed.
The UT freshman had the nation's top leap entering the competition
(7 feet, 6 inches), but could clear only 7-0 1/2 recently to finish
tied for 10th.
Thornton felt better after the 1,600-meter relay prelims. The
Longhorns' quartet of Matt Ellis, David Aaron, Terrence Wakefield
and Calvin Williams ran the fifth-fastest qualifying time, 3
minutes, 6.10 seconds, to advance to the finals.
The Longhorns women, meanwhile, fared well in their bid for
their first outdoor team championship since 1986. The UT women
advanced nearly everyone they expected to except for Liz Diaz in
the 1,500, and got sparkling performances from Suziann Reid in the
400 dash and 1,600 relay.
Reid, the national leader who won the NCAA outdoors as a
freshman and the NCAA indoors in March, broke her own school record
in the 400 with a clocking of 50.86 seconds. The junior also
anchored Texas' 1,600 relay that recorded a season-best clocking of
3:29.40.
Feeling good was something that escaped Wagner and Boswell.
Fighting gusty winds that played havoc with their approaches,
Wagner failed to clear the opening bar of 6-11 to no-height for the
first time in his life. Boswell, a native of Brompton, Ontario,
Canada, who was competing in front of his mother, three sisters,
girlfriend and numerous other friends, passed at 6-11, cleared 7- 0
1/2 on his second try and missed all three attempts at 7-2 1/4.
For Wagner, who competed most of the year on a left knee that
will require arthroscopic surgery in about two weeks for cartilage
damage, Thursday's competition pretty much told the story of his
season.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. When high-end retailer Neiman Marcus
announces the grand opening of its Worth Avenue store in the year
2000 or so, only island residents will know.
To prove its target customer lives in Palm Beach and that it
will not be regional store, Neiman Marcus agreed not to advertise
in major local newspapers, on television, radio or through mass
mailings for a year after it opens.
That was only one of many conditions the Dallas-based retailer
agreed to gain approval of a three-story, 48,661-square foot store
from the town council by a 4-1 vote.
The Mediterranean Revival-style building with two levels of
underground parking will be on the easternmost block of Worth
Avenue, across the street from rival Saks and the Esplanade
shopping center.
