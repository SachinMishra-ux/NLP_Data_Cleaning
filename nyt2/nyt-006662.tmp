This year Estes switched to a stronger grip, turning his hands
to the right and his game up several notches. He made the change
without using instruction from a swing coach. Estes now wishes
someone had advised him earlier in his career to use a stronger
grip, which produces right-to-left shots that tend to carry farther
than the left-to-right shots from a weak grip.
Estes ranks ninth in scoring average, 70.04 strokes per round.
He has made 15 cuts in 16 events. He tied for second at Bay Hill in
March and finished third at Greensboro in April.
Even so, he is not satisfied, particulary with his putting.
Though he ranks 20th in that category, Estes said he needs to
become better to elevate his game.
It was not those putts that cost Estes a victory this year,
though. At Greensboro, he led by one shot with two holes left but
made bogey at both, missing four-foot putts at each.
So Estes will now try crosshanded putting, placing his left hand
lower than the right. Some golfers say that enables them to move
their putter down the line more easily. Proponents of crosshanded
putting say that the conventional grip right hand below left is
less steady, because the left wrist can break down, producing putts
that pull to the left.

Penders, who resigned under pressure at Texas on April 2, would
replace Mike Jarvis, who recently was hired by St. John's.
If Penders does become coach, he can leave his box of tools
behind this time. Penders, renowned as a Mr. Fix-It in college
basketball, turned losing programs into winners at Rhode Island and
Texas. He would start on higher ground at George Washington. The
Colonials were 152-90 in eight seasons under Jarvis, including 24-9
last season. They were 11-5 in the Atlantic-10 Conference, tied for
first in the West Division. Four starters return from that team. If
there is an adjustment period, it might be because Penders, who
prefers up-tempo basketball, inherits a team with more size than
quickness, one accustomed to a half-court game.
George Washington made four NCAA tournament appearances under
Jarvis, reaching the third round in 1993 and losing in the first
round in '94, '96 and '98.
When Penders went to Rhode Island from Fordham in 1986, he
inherited a program that was 42-97 the previous five seasons. Rhode
Island finished 20-10 in Penders' first season and 28-7 the next,
reaching the third round of the 1988 NCAA tournament before losing
to Duke by one point.
