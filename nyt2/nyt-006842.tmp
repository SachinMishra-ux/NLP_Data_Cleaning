On Monday it was reported that ATT had been negotiating to
acquire America Online. And on Tuesday, Microsoft Corp. opened a
public test of its new portal, known as Start, which is expected to
be in full operation by the end of the year.
In the meantime, Netscape Communications Corp. is busy shifting
its focus from making browsers to operating a portal site, and
media giants like Time Warner and News Corp. are looking to build
or buy similar services.
While there are tens of thousands of commercial Web sites, most
of the attention is now focused on the handful that help users find
the information, services or entertainment that they are looking
for. Since many people use these sites to start their treks through
cyberspace, they are far and away the most popular places on the
Internet. As a result, they have attracted the lion's share of
advertising as well as investor interest.
America Online, which 18 months ago was drowning in busy signals
and irate customers, has rebounded into the powerhouse of
cyberspace with 12 million paying customers, a market value of $19
billion and the self assurance to rebuff ATT's takeover offer last
month.
Yahoo, the largest of the free, advertiser-supported portal
services, attracts more than 70 million users a month and has a
value of about $6 billion, despite barely breaking even.
As these sites grow rapidly in market value and viewership if
not profits many media companies are deciding that they need to
buy one quickly, despite the high prices, before they become
unaffordable. More than one media giant has expressed regret for
not having bought America Online when it was much cheaper.
Moreover, as television, telephones and computers all converge
into one integrated network of communications and entertainment,
companies of all sorts see portals as a possible keystone to their
future strategy. The power to funnel users to certain advertisers
and content sites is worth millions of dollars in revenue.
Disney's intention is to create a new Internet service that
combines Infoseek with its existing offerings, which include Web
sites for ABC television, ABC News, the ESPN sports network,
Disney's movies, and a site of original Disney entertainment for
children.
Disney, like many other media companies, has been talking to a
number of portal services over the last year. A few months ago, it
was close to buying a part of Excite, the No. 2 portal service, but
the deal fell apart over the price, investment bankers said.
With the stock of the search services trading at stratospheric
prices, big companies have been loath to buy them either with cash
or their own, more conventionally valued shares.
