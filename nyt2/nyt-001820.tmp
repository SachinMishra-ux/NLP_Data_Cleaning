Lukas clearly likes his name. It is prominently displayed not
only across his barn but on his belt, on his yellow jacket and even
on his black cap. Not that he needs people to notice him. He has
led the nation's trainers in earnings for 14 of the last 15 years,
and he ranks fourth all-time with 10 victories in Triple Crown
events.
But he has been ineffective lately. His best 3-year-old, Cape
Town, ran fifth in the Kentucky Derby and ninth in the Preakness,
when he fractured a foot. He was retired, though not before
delivering a parting shot, kicking Lukas in the head and drawing
blood outside the Preakness barn.
The Lukas bad luck continued Thursday, when he drew the
farthest-out post positions for Yarrow Brae and Grand Slam in
Saturday's 130th Belmont Stakes.
But some horsemen approached Grand Slam's owners expressing
condolences about the unlucky 13 post and commenting how everything
is going Bob Baffert's way. Baffert is the trainer of Real Quiet,
who is trying for the first Triple Crown sweep since Affirmed 20
years ago.
Real Quiet was listed as the 6-5 favorite in the official
morning line, and Baffert was pleased with his No. 8 post,
especially since the 7-2 second favorite, Victory Gallop, pulled
No. 11.
In his only trip on an off track, Real Quiet ran eighth, while
Grand Slam, Yellow Brae and the Houston-connected Victory Gallop
all have run well in mud.
Only 11 horses in a century have won the Triple Crown, and 13
have failed after taking the first two legs.
Grand Slam, the third favorite in the Belmont field, was given
6-1 odds to stop Real Quiet. In the Experimental Free Handicap,
Grand Slam was ranked second to Favorite Trick among 2-year-olds in
1997. He beat Lil's Lad and Halory Hunter in the 1-mile Champagne
Stakes last October. But the next month, he underwent surgery for
an injury to his left hind leg.
Lukas was criticized for rushing the healing process with Grand
Slam, who ran sixth in the San Pedro Handicap in March. The
62-year-old trainer drew flak for entering the colt in the
Lexington Stakes in April.
But third place in that race indicated a comeback was
progressing. That notion was confirmed by a two-length win in the
Peter Pan Stakes two weeks ago at Belmont Park.
