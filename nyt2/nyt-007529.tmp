Over the last six years, only a handful of players took the
teams that drafted them from the lottery to the playoffs. The
number includes Kevin Garnett and Stephon Marbury (Minnesota),
Grant Hill (Detroit), Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway (Orlando)
and Alonzo Mourning (Charlotte).
ATLANTA -- Please forgive today's hysterical amount of newsprint
devoted to a few baseball games in June, but we feel a little pulp
friction is appropriate here.
Big news, the approach of any Braves series that is more than
the usual corporate outing or a nice day for the Newnan Pony
League. You've got to understand that this team, by its consistent
drone atop the standings, can get a little stupefying during the
regular season. We've gone through all the usual adjectives in the
'90s, done just about all the gymnastics possible over the National
League East's Atlanta Foregone Conclusions. There's so little left
to give when they throw at you, as they have these last 10 days, a
steady low-fat diet of Expo and Marlin.
So, when they're off Monday for two games at The House George
Wants To Demolish, returning directly here for two more against the
New York Yankees, it's as good a reason as any to over-react. A
best-of-four might not be the perfect format for deciding the fate
of civilization, but that's how they do dress rehearsals for the
World Series these days.
Know why it's a big deal? It's something different, a boot to
the butt of complacency.
These are the kinds of games that justify the entire concept of
interleague play. All the arguments against it evaporate over the
heat of the next week.
Anything that gets Andruw Jones back to the Bronx, where the kid
homered in his first two World Series at-bats, is worthwhile.
Apparently, they're getting the same sort of tingle about June
baseball in cosmopolitan New York. The press boxes in both cities
reportedly will be filled, a hopeful sign that America still
regards a good baseball game almost as highly as a Nigeria-Paraguay
soccer game (that 1-1 tie is scheduled for Wednesday).
Even as you're reading this, I'm sure the New York Post is
preparing bold headlines for this Series:
A warning. We have been through this once before. Last season,
it was a visit by the Baltimore Ripkens that got everyone in a
froth. Neither team kept its Fall Classic appointment, there being
no bacon behind the sizzle.
