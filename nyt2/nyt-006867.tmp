Cleveland was at an immediate disadvantage against Hernandez,
even before the Indians' first at-bat. Charles Nagy, the Cleveland
starter, threw two low curveballs that Tschida called for strikes;
these parameters of the strike zone could not have been better
suited for Hernandez, who throws many types of breaking balls that
spin low.
The Indians had seven hits and three walks during Hernandez's
seven innings, but until his final inning of work, he seemed to be
completely in control. Torre wondered aloud last week how Hernandez
would respond to pressure. This is his answer: Cleveland was
hitless in its first eight at-bats with runners in scoring
position, Hernandez throwing curves, sliders, changeups and
fastballs from all different angles. Twice Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove griped to the umpires about how Hernandez wiggled his
fingers when working from the set position, probably an attempt to
rattle the rookie. But Hernandez would not be bothered.
The Indians had a runner at third and one out in the third
inning, and Hernandez whiffed Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome, with a
slider and changeup, respectively. The Indians had another runner
at third and one out the next inning; Hernandez struck out Mark
Whiten and Pat Borders.
Hernandez carried a 2-0 lead into the seventh, allowing a walk
and a single to open the inning. Borders stared at a third-strike
fastball, David Bell grounded out, advancing the runners and
bringing Kenny Lofton to the plate. Lofton, who seemed to be the
only Cleveland batter remotely comfortable hitting against
Hernandez, fouled off three pitches with two strikes, before lining
a two-run single to right and tying the game.
Hernandez retired the first two batters in the eighth, jamming
Ramirez so badly with a fastball that the right fielder fell
backward in the batter's box as the ball trickled up the first base
line where Hernandez, charging off the mound, gloved it just
before it edged foul, and ran to stomp on the bag himself.
Having thrown 122 pitches to that point, however, Hernandez was
lifted. He lowered his earned run average to 1.52. He has allowed
16 hits and 6 walks in his first 23 2/3 innings.
Derek Jeter, in the final step of rehabilitating his abdominal
strain, played for Class AAA Columbus Thursday night, in Durham,
N.C., and hit two doubles and struck out in four at-bats. He made a
throwing error for the Clippers; interestingly, he hasn't made a
single throwing error for the Yankees. Jeter is expected to join
the Yankees Friday and play against Cleveland, after being
activated off the 15-day disabled list.
Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington Research, a
company that advises institutional investors on legal terms, said
she is not surprised that producers have decided to take their
chances in the courtroom, at least in the short term.
The collapse of the McCain bill and the prospect of renewed
courtroom conflict will cause many state attorneys general to
jump-start their lawsuits against producers. A large majority of
the states involved in last June's plan were late in suing
producers and many of those states, expecting the settlement to win
congressional approval, have not done much pretrial work.
Legislators in just a few states have introduced bills over the
past year that would make it easier for a state to prevail in a
lawsuit against a cigarette company. Such a bill, which effectively
allows a state to recover collectively rather than pressing
individual claims on behalf of every smoker treated, was considered
instrumental in Florida's ability to negotiate an $11.3 billion
settlement with the industry last August.
