The IMF sent the Russian government a confidential memo last
week outlining its conditions for billions of dollars in new aid.
One major condition was that the government slash its deficit to
2.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product by 1999, well
under the 4.5 percent target originally envisioned by the
government.
Some pro-reform officials say they agree in principle with the
requirements but worry that the government may not be able to meet
all of them.
For example, one condition is to enact a new tax code. But that
means winning over a Communist-dominated Parliament.
The new deficit target is considered to be very ambitious. And a
suggestion that Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, be broken
up is generally considered to be unrealistic by Russian officials.
