A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a
lesson worth pondering. (To publish this excellent article, it must be purchased the rate

After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
Outright depression in Japan, further rounds of economic and
political turmoil in the rest of Asia, and a global slump to
follow: might this dismal scenario unfold after all?
On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must and can act decisively to revive its
economy.
It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
