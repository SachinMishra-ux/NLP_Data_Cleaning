Dobson and his Focus on the Family have moved into the vacuum,
with a brisk, family-oriented, authoritarian moralism.
He first made his name with the charmingly-titled Dare to
Discipline, a child-rearing guide for the tough of mind and hard of
hand. And it is discipline which he wants to bring back to the
Republican Party: the smack of firm government.
At a series of bad-tempered meetings earlier this year, Dobson
publicly threatened to pull away from the Republican Party
altogether unless it started adopting his agenda.
The Republicans have had to listen: since his demarche, the
quixotic party leader in the House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, has veered towards the trio's positions and taken a much
harder stand on morality questions.
Influence behind the scenes is not enough, however: Bauer and
Ashcroft have both started to sound out the prospects of a
presidential candidacy in 2000.
Senator Ashcroft, with plenty of on-the-stump experience, is
more likely, and could be one of three or four Republicans with a
serious shot at the nomination.
But his righteous partners are already having a political
impact, backing candidates in Republican primaries for this year's
Congressional races with their words and their cash, which in turn
has triggered conflicts among different factions within the party.
The economy is booming and President Bill Clinton is as popular
as ever, but the Republicans could still have expected a good
showing in November's elections.
The religious right, however, is causing near-civil war in some
of their key campaigns. While the Dobson and Bauer candidates have
not been that successful, they have driven wedges into cracks that
were already opening up within the Right.
Their most notable victory was a primary for a special
Congressional election in California, where their candidate beat a
moderate for the Republican nomination, only to be trounced later
by the Democrat. Ironically, Reagan's home is in the district.
