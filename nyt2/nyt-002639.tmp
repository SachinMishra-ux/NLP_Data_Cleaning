State officials, who will help finance and oversee the new
program, say about 12,000 disabled mothers will participate in
workfare initially, with the first group starting in two months.
The remaining 21,000 disabled welfare mothers may follow if the
program works well, city officials say.
But the shift in policy, which comes five months after Giuliani
vowed to move virtually all of the city's welfare recipients into
workfare jobs, was quickly condemned by advocates for the poor, who
said it violates state law and endangers the lives of the sickest
and most vulnerable New Yorkers.
The clash between advocates and city officials over the issue
marks only the beginning of a contentious debate that will likely
land in civil court, and one that already swirls across much of the
nation as states like Florida, Oregon and Wisconsin push disabled
people on public assistance into the workplace.
Under federal law, mothers on public assistance can receive
welfare checks for only five years, regardless of whether they are
disabled or not. State officials may exempt 20 percent of their
welfare mothers from the time limit, but many are still pushing as
many women into work as they can, fearful that more than 20 percent
will still need benefits when the deadline hits.
In New York City, where welfare officials have been sued for
assigning people with less serious medical ailments to workfare
jobs that threaten their health, advocates for the poor found the
new policy particularly alarming.
Last month, a state judge ordered the city to create a process
that would allow welfare recipients to challenge work assignments
for health and safety reasons. But that process would apply to
welfare recipients without severe medical problems, workers with
asthma who can answer telephones but cannot scrub dusty garages,
for instance. This group is classified as employable, but with
limitations.
The city's new policy is directed toward a group that city
doctors say are actually unable to work, and advocates say it will
be impossible to find suitable work for this group. About 4,000
welfare mothers have been deemed permanently unemployable by the
city's medical contractor, Health Services Systems. About 30,000
have been classified as temporarily unemployable, meaning they
cannot work for three to six months.
They are young women like Daisy Rivera, 28, who was deemed
permanently unemployable because she suffers from severe asthma and
weighs 400 pounds. They are older women like Evelyn Valle, 39, who
hobbled to the welfare office, leaning hard on a scratched wooden
cane because of the arthritis in her hip. Or like Aglaee Muniz, 57,
who takes medication for severe depression and diabetes and was
also classified as permanently unable to work.
City officials say the new program has been carefully planned to
meet the needs of this population, which was unable to participate
in the traditional workfare program along with the 32,000 current
participants. The work sites will be chosen by officials at four
groups, Goodwill Industries, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community
Service, the National Center for Disability Services and the
Federation Employment and Guidance Service, who will safeguard the
health and safety of the new workers.
All told, the groups must place at least 228 mothers in
unsubsidized jobs for at least 90 days by March 1999.
