It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.
