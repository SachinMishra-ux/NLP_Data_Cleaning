Add the two World Series rings with the New York Mets and Los
Angeles Dodgers and you'd think Baltimore reliever Jesse Orosco,
who turned 41 April 21 and is in his 21st professional season 18
in the majors would look back on his career and point to the
championships and the personal statistics as his crowning
achievements.
But Orosco, who saved Game 7 of the 1986 World Series against
the Red Sox for the Mets, figures he's probably set a different
kind of rec-ord.
Orosco, who had a career-high 71 appearances with the Orioles
last season and whose 975 relief appearances for five teams rank
fourth in major league history, is still going strong, physically
and mentally.
BOSTON He was a career .247 hitter who signed on last December
with his fifth major league team since the 1995 season. But Red Sox
outfielder Darren Lewis, who went 3 for 5 with a home run in
Thursday night's 9-1 thrashing of the Orioles at Fenway Park, is
not only batting .300, he's rediscovered his old San Francisco
Giants niche as a leadoff hitter.
Pressed into service at the top of the order by Jimy Williams
when Nomar Garciaparra went down with a shoulder injury in early
May, Lewis has batted leadoff in 23 of Boston's last 24 games.
Both Williams and Lewis were part of the dramatic 1993 pennant
race in the National League West when the Braves, for whom Williams
was a coach, won their 104th game on the last day of the regular
season. The Giants, who won 103 games that season, the last before
the wild card, were beaten by the Dodgers in their final game.
Lewis, who set a personal season high Thursday night with six
total bases and tied his season highs with three hits and three
RBIs, would like nothing better than to get another taste of
postseason play.
He came heartbreakingly close as a key man with the Giants in
'93 and was a backup outfielder with the Reds in 1995 when they
were eliminated in the National League Championship Series by the
Braves.
BUFFALO Joe Juneau, pilot, aeronautical engineer, and center,
helped the Capitals fly into the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night
when he knocked home Brian Bellows's rebound at 6:24 of overtime,
leading Washington to a 3-2 victory over the Sabres in Game 6 of
the Eastern Conference finals at Marine Midland Arena.
Juneau, the former Bruin who was traded to Washington in March
1994 for Al Iafrate, was left with an easy tap at the right post
after Bellows twice took shots at goalie Dominik Hasek shots that
were set up by another ex-Bruin, Adam Oates.
