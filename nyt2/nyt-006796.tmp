Some of those little one-person carts are trying to making it
around the course. This course isn't friendly to such unstable
toys. You look down from the clubhouse, across the fairways cut
through the huge cypress and pines, the championship course at The
Olympic Club looks like the Grand Canyon of golf. One senior almost
toppled and complained that his sciatica was killing him. My wife
gave him two Advil and told him to call his doctor in the morning.
Word just flashed on the board that Tiger Woods had doubled the
shortest hole on the course. It's 137 yards up the hill toward the
clubhouse, No. 8. He later four-putted another hole and soon was
off the board. Cink was now leading the tournament, the same Cink
who had twice beaten Woods while they were in college.
He was 3-under, soon to be joined by a guy playing just ahead of
him, Ted Oh, a 21-year-old Korean from Las Vegas, who shares Butch
Harmon, the professor, with Woods. This was really looking good
now.
Well, the ninth hole rose up and bit Cink. More to the point,
Cink bit himself with a tee shot in the deep spinach. He could only
pitch out and settle for his first bogey. He made the turn two
under par, but Cink's flirtation with the lead was done for the
day. He bogeyed the 11th from the rough, but hell struck on the
16th, 609 yards long, par-5. He left it the rough twice, missed the
green, then two-putted. Double bogey.
Tom Watson had predicted that the winning score will be over
par. That being the case, Payne Stewart was looking pretty good at
66. He had made his score on the tough holes, 16, 17 and 18, and
probably no player would birdie would birdie the last two holes all
week. As for Cink, he wouldn't even be low Yellow Jacket. That
would be the kid, amateur Matt Kuchar, coming in at even par, still
on his Masters games, flashing his old Masters smile.

In addition, the HMO's new national policy will apply to other
prescription treatments for erectile dysfunction, including
suppositories and pills not yet on the market.
The decision was reached after an unprecedented national policy
review that had a team of physicians, ethicists and pharmacists
delving into such issues as the medical necessity for erections and
the dangers of recreational use of pills like Viagra.
