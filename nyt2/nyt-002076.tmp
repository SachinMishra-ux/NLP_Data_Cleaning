The train, Inter-City-Express 884, slammed into a
steel-reinforced concrete overpass at 125 mph on Wednesday in the
northern German town of Eschede. Rescue officials said Friday that
there was an increasing belief among investigators that a broken
wheel flung the train from the tracks as it passed over a switch
just before it hit the road overpass.
On Wednesday investigators found damage to the tracks about
three and a half miles south of the crash, suggesting that the
wheel broke at that point.
Rescue officials in Eschede said Friday that only 19 of the dead
had been formally identified. Even traditional methods of
identification, like using dental records, were proving impossible
because of extensive head injuries. Police say they want to spare
relatives from seeing the mangled bodies until authorities are sure
of their identities.
German authorities withdrew 60 of the 104 high-speed
Inter-City-Express trains from service Thursday so that they could
be inspected for fatigue in their undercarriages. Ten of them
returned to service Friday.
Some people in Hamburg the scheduled destination of Inter-City
884 from Munich and in Hanover, 35 miles south of the wreck,
placed flowers next to the tracks.
Veit Steinle, a spokesman for the Transport Ministry in Bonn,
said that investigators had discovered debris along the track
before the overpass and that there was evidence that the train had
finally swayed out of control some 300 yards before Eschede.
But officials said it could take weeks or months before an
official inquiry reported on the cause of the crash.
Political gyrations, economic turmoil, crashing stock markets,
embattled currency, collapsing tax revenue. In such troubled times,
Russia might be forgiven for leaning hard on the one thing it can
count on: oil and natural-gas exports, paid for in dollars. Some
investors worry that a sorely pressed government might flood the
already glutted world oil market and depress prices further.
Far from ramping up production, the Russian oil industry has had
to cut output by about 60,000 barrels a day because low prices about $11 a barrel for Russian exports, down from $18 a year ago and high production costs have made some wells uneconomical, Ms.
Hittle said.
Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer, after Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, with a big domestic industry and vast
reserves, and it has a long history of using its output for its own
political and economic purposes, ignoring the efforts of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries of which it is not
a member to manage world supplies.
