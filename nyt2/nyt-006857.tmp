Boyd said that library officials had already closed the
second-floor restrooms in response to the first rape and had forced
patrons to ask for a key to those on the first floor, which can now
be used by only one person at a time. He said officials increased
the number of security guards in the library Thursday to five from
three, and planned to install 10 to 15 security cameras.
NEW YORK Melvin Barnet, who was among several editors and
reporters questioned by a congressional committee investigating
communist affiliations in the news business in the 1950s and who
was dismissed by The New York Times after invoking the Fifth
Amendment, died June 17 at Long Island College Hospital in
Brooklyn. He was 83 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
The subcommittee had been looking into disclosures made by
Winston Burdett, a CBS correspondent who said he had joined the
Communist Party in the late 1930s while working at The Brooklyn
Eagle. As the opening witness in the subcommittee hearings, Burdett
named 12 former colleagues at The Eagle, including Barnet, as party
members.
When, two weeks later, Barnet, a Harvard graduate and an Army
veteran of World War II, was asked about these and other names, he
repeated his refusal to comment, citing the constitutional
protection against self-incrimination.
In that period, characterized by fears of Soviet espionage and
communist-hunting by Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., such responses
were at times offered by witnesses who believed it dishonorable to
name old colleagues and implicate them in their own troubles.
Seven employees of the news department were called before the
Eastland subcommittee; six provided accounts of their communist
backgrounds to the editors of The Times, and remained in their
jobs.
After he was fired, Barnet had difficulty finding work. He
picked oranges in Florida, served as cook on a shrimp boat and
edited manuscripts for vanity presses before joining The Medical
Tribune, a journal distributed to doctors, in the 1960s. He was
associate editor when he retired in 1978.
He is survived by his wife, Joan; a son, Michael Cross-Barnet of
Santa Monica, Calif.; a brother, Stuart, and a sister, Beverly
Morrison, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
The incident in New Jersey in which five gunshots were fired
into the house of a sex offender shows how vulnerable these
individuals are to vigilante actions. New Jersey Attorney General
Peter Verniero has vowed to prosecute the unknown shooters and is
directing local authorities to increase community education efforts
to prevent vigilantism, but such measures do not correct the
problem inherent in the state's sex-offender notification law.
New Jersey's law provides notification to community groups,
schools and even whole neighborhoods. The information inevitably
spreads far beyond the neighborhood, and the broader the
dissemination, the greater the risk of trouble. In 1995, two men
broke into a house and beat a New Jersey man whom they mistakenly
thought was a sex offender.
