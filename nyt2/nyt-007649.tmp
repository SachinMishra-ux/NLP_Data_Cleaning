Agassi opens Monday on Court 1 against Alex Calatrava, another
Spaniard with no Wimbledon credentials, but Pioline could encounter
an immediate stumbling block in Switzerland's Marc Rosset.
No. 7-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who won the Halle title only to
have his grass-court prowess evaporate last week at Rosmalen, where
Detroit's Steve Campbell upended him, has the versatility to mount
an impressive Wimbledon campaign. But he, like Sampras, has been
experiencing some confidence tremors of late, and his first-round
assignment against Mark Philippoussis, whose gigantic serve is
dwarfed by the colossal unreliability of the rest of his strokes,
will be a litmus test.
With the exception of Sampras, not one of the players who has
picked up a title at the last five Grand Slam events has managed to
collect a title since. And Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, has botched repeated chances to supplant Sampras.
RENO, Nev. Against the vivid backdrop of recent fatal school
shootings, elected officials across the United States for the first
time are coordinating efforts, sometimes with unlikely partners, to
reduce the incidents of gun violence.
In perhaps the most unusual of the collaborations, Philadelphia
Mayor Edward Rendell has agreed to join forces with the National
Rifle Association to create a model program in Philadelphia to test
one of the NRA's core beliefs, that vigorous prosecution of people
who violate federal gun laws would eliminate more violent crime
than tighter gun-control laws.
In a broader effort aimed at finding other solutions to the same
problems, representatives of the nation's firearms industry have
formed a task force with several mayors and county executives to
study innovative ways to prevent guns from getting into the hands
of children and criminals.
Rendell's pending collaboration with the NRA arose out of a
challenge by the association's new president, actor Charlton
Heston. At the NRA's convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia to
which Rendell was not invited because of his support for tighter
gun-control measures Heston proposed that the federal government
designate one large U.S. city to test the NRA's theory that most
gun violence occurs because the criminal justice system is not
tough enough on criminals.
Heston suggested Philadelphia might be a good place to test it,
because homicide rates there have held steady over the last decade,
at more than 400 a year, despite what Rendell contends have been
vigorous prosecutions and harsh prison sentences.
To win approval for a three-year program that would likely cost
as much as $5 million to send extra federal prosecutors and agents
into Philadelphia, the NRA has agreed to lobby Congress for
support, and Rendell has agreed to what may be the more formidable
task, winning the backing of the Clinton administration.
Lynn Cutler, a senior White House official attending the
conference, predicted that the president would be receptive to
exploring the idea even though Heston sharply attacked him
politically and personally at the NRA convention.
