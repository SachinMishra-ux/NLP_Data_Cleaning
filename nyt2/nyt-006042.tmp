A good suppressor should have been tested by Underwriters
Laboratories to let through no more than about 300 volts when it's
hit by a 6,000-volt power spike. This is called the UL 1449 rating be sure yours meets this standard. Of course you should buy a
suppressor with a lifetime insurance policy to pay for damages to
your computer. But that doesn't mean the device itself will last a
lifetime. Many surge suppressors use circuitry that loses its
protective power after a few years. It makes sense to buy new every
half-decade or so.
Surge boxes won't help during a brownout or blackout. For that,
you need an uninterruptible power supply. Once only used in
businesses, they've gotten cheap enough to consider for the home.
American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., lent me their
BackUPS Office product for a tryout. It looks like an overgrown
surge suppressor with six outlets and a heavy lead-acid battery
inside, but it gets the job done. I pulled the plug on my home PC
by way of a test. The battery drove the computer with two hard
drives, and a monitor and my Iomega Zip drive, for 12 minutes
before it gave up the ghost. That was plenty of time to do a safe
shutdown. The BackUPS Office sells for around $125. And there are
more expensive battery backup devices that come with software
that'll automatically shut down your machine during a blackout.
Regular readers know that I like to keep my computer busy. Even
when I'm not working on it, the machine is often toiling away on
its own, indexing the data on my hard drives or downloading some
free software.
Still, with the coming of summer, I find myself punching the Off
switch more frequently than usual. It's the time of year for
sudden, violent storms, with lightning bolts that can toast
microcircuitry into pumpernickel.
I love lightning; computers hate it. A near-direct hit 13 years
ago wrecked the first computer I ever owned. Yes, I was using a
surge suppressor. Good thing too the surge-box maker picked up
the $600 repair tab.
That's why you install one of these devices insurance. Surge
suppressors give your computer an extra measure of protection from
electrical unpleasantness. And if they don't work, you won't have
to pay for the damage to your hardware.
A host of electric power glitches can afflict computers.
Lightning strikes, of course, but also harmonic power-line noise
from electric motors. That can alter the standard 60-hertz
frequency that your computer is designed for. There are power sags
caused by other devices starting up if your lights flicker when
the fridge starts up, you know what I mean. There are brownouts longer-lasting power sags that may occur on hot summer days when
electric demand is greater than the utility can supply. And of
course the power can die altogether.
Even so, Hester favors some extra protection. For most people,
that means a standard surge suppressor that filters the electricity
going to your computer.
But be sure you're using it properly. That means that every
single electrical device connected to your computer should be
hooked up to the suppressor. Skip just one of them the printer,
say and a surge can pass through it and roast your machine. Your
phone line can carry surges right into your modem. Nowadays, surge
boxes nearly always include phone line protection. Use it. And if
your surge protector isn't properly grounded, it's no better than
an extension cord. So plug into a proper three-prong outlet. The
better surge suppressors will even have an indicator light to tell
you if they're grounded.
