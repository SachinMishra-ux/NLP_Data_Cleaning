Indeed, the story of prekindergarten in New York is emerging as
the story of good intentions crashing into difficult realities.
In some areas of the city, parents have been unable to submit
applications for their preschoolers because district officials have
not picked the private preschools they will use. Bathrooms and
playgrounds are still being inspected, teacher credentials reviewed
and classrooms observed.
As school officials have discovered, conditions at private
preschools vary widely. Dirty floors and a dearth of books at a day
care center on the ground floor of an East New York housing project
dismayed one superintendent, while the emphasis on penmanship at a
preschool in northern Queens troubled another district official,
who considered the school's approach too rigid.
And recently, a new complication was unearthed: When a Brooklyn
superintendent showed up to inspect a yeshiva, it was closed for a
religious holiday, revealing the potential chaos that mismatched
school calendars could create for working parents.
Still, most educators unequivocally embrace the concept of
preschool education, not just in New York but around the United
States. A survey taken last year by the Children's Defense Fund, an
advocacy group based in Washington, found that 21 states had
increased financing of preschool programs, most of them intended
for poor children.
Last year, the New Jersey Legislature set aside $125 million for
prekindergarten classes in 125 of the state's poorest school
districts. In Connecticut, lawmakers agreed last year to spend $86
million over two years on prekindergarten classes in more than a
dozen poor, mostly urban districts.
When the universal prekindergarten law was enacted a year ago,
it drew bipartisan support from lawmakers, and got a strong boost
from Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. The program is voluntary for
parents. New York City's Board of Education voted to require each
of its 32 districts to provide the classes.
Champions of the program cited research pointing to the
long-term benefits of early education. For instance, studies of
Head Start, the federally financed prekindergarten program for poor
children, showed that preschoolers enrolled in the program
initially showed measurable improvements in health, school
attendance and cognitive test scores. The gains in cognitive test
scores, however, faded after a couple of years.
The program is financed with $46 million in state funds for the
1988-89 school year, matched by $5 million from the Board of
Education. Unlike Head Start, which is limited to needy children,
New York's prekindergarten program is available to children
regardless of their family income, though in the first year only
districts with the largest percentage of poor children including
all New York City districts are eligible.
Private preschools that want contracts with the city school
system must be licensed by the city, and they cannot offer
religious instruction. Any parochial schools involved in the new
program will, under the state law, have to scrub classroom walls of
religious icons and agree to a secular curriculum.
