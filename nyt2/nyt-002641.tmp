The setback put Cone in a fury. And the only way to assuage that
fury, as well as stem the torrent of bad jokes, was to pitch well.
Sunday the Florida Marlins were the unwitting victims of that
resolve, learning that the pedigree of the pitcher, not the dog,
was what truly counted. Cone roared back to the forefront of the
Yankees' impressive rotation, pitching a 14-strikeout complete game
and not only beating the Marlins, 4-1, but beating a pack of his
own demons.
Thus his intense lobbying after the eighth inning, the only one
in which the Marlins managed a run. The overmatched youngsters from
the decimated World Series champions had broken through when Cone
issued a two-out walk to second baseman Craig Counsell, then a
run-scoring double to Florida's burgeoning gem, Todd Dunwoody.
The double, which deeply disappointed Cone, also drove him. He
all but begged for the right to pitch the ninth inning. Torre, his
team about to go 31 games over .500, did not need that much
convincing. The Yankees had a three-run lead, Cone had shown the
necessary heart, as always, and Torre did not hesitate in showing
loyalty.
Such is the nature of even the most competent and proven. They,
too, need to be convinced. Especially when the career path is as
pocked as Cone's has been in recent years. His injuries seem as
plentiful as they are peculiar. Surgeries were performed on the
pitcher's shoulder to correct an aneurysm in 1996 and to clean out
the debris caused by wear and tear in '97.
Cone sought to put more serious issues to bed as well Sunday.
For the relentless setbacks of the last few years have prevented
Cone from regaining his Cy Young-caliber touch. That had caused
more doubts than one little nip could. This Cone knows; his
teammates know it, too.
It is a bit disconcerting to hear a pitcher talk about needing
the boost of confidence after watching him master a team, even one
so flailing as the Marlins, losers of 11 straight.
And there he was, clinging to his first complete-game victory
since May 1996 as if it were a life preserver, needing a boost of
confidence only he could provide for himself.
DETROIT Mixing his usual candor with a little diplomacy, coach
Ron Wilson of the Washington Capitals was evaluating how his team
came to find itself in the Stanley Cup finals against the defending
champion, Detroit.
Along with their history of eliminating the Washington team, the
Flyers, Devils and Penguins were the top three seeded teams in the
Eastern Conference. Instead of playing any of them, the
fourth-seeded Capitals faced Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo.
Now, beginning here Tuesday night in Joe Louis Arena, the
Capitals meet the Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings,
who will be making their third appearance in four seasons in the
championship round. With the possible exception of the goalie
position, the Red Wings seem to match up stronger than the Capitals
in talent and depth.
