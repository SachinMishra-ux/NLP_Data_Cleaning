The C70 is testament to the competitive pressures faced by
relatively small, independent auto makers like Volvo at a time when
Volkswagen has built a lineup from Skodas to Silver Seraphs, when
Daimler-Benz gazed into the future and decided to get there now by
merging with Chrysler.
To thrive, Volvo must broaden its lineup, but it lacks a parent
with the deep pockets needed to develop an array of car platforms.
So it has pinned its future on three basic front-wheel-drive
platforms the compact 40 series, which arrives in fall 1999; the
midsize 70 series, formerly known as the 850, and a new flagship,
the 80 series, which goes on sale in October.
For the C70, a low-volume car that marks Volvo's first,
tentative steps to move its image up the scale, it borrowed the
structure of its S70 family sedan. Volvo asked Tom Walkinshaw
Racing, a British specialty company, to infuse the workaday
platform with sporting character.
The results are mixed: While the C70 holds its own in track
testing against similarly priced rivals, excelling at acceleration
and road-holding tests, it can feel unpolished on real-world
byways. Inoffensive if not impressive on smooth roads, the C70 is
harsh and jumpy on rough patches.
The steering wheel does not send back much road feel, though the
steering effort is heavy. Nor does the wheel want to return to a
neutral center without some prodding. While a rear-drive BMW grips
corners as if it had claws, the front-drive Volvo is inclined to
plow ahead on turns.
It is, in all, a car that is difficult to drive smoothly. A
balky five-speed manual transmission adds to the hijinks. While
Volvo should be applauded for offering a stick shift Mercedes
does not the C70 is one of the few cars I'd prefer with an
automatic.
Either transmission plays second fiddle to the C70's main
attribute, a turbo-charged screamer of an engine. Shared with
Volvo's sportiest sedan, the S70 T5, the sideways-mounted in-line
five cylinder behaves innocuously most of the time. But a kick of
the accelerator rockets the car ahead like the starship Enterprise
engaging warp speed.
The horsepower rating is deceptively modest, just 236, but the
engine reaches peak torque, 243 foot-pounds, at just 2,700 rpm. If
a tailgate terrorist bears down from behind, the C70 can leave him
in the dust listening to the turbo's throaty roar.
You pay a price for such maneuvers. There is a hint of turbo
lag, a brief, disconcerting pause before the car shoots ahead, and
torque steer, in which the rush of power tugs the driving wheels
from side to side.
