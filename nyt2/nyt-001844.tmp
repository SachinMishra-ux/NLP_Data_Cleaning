This matchup could have led to fights in the regular season. But
in this important a game, it created only a few extra hard hits and
a couple of penalties. Kruse went off for roughing at 5:06. Hunter
got the same minor at 13:56.
NEW YORK The search for a head basketball coach at St. John's
plodded on Thursday with the school insisting that it has not given
up hope of hiring George Washington Coach Mike Jarvis, but also
making a move to secure a backup plan.
While St. John's officials have not made an offer or even a call
to Jarvis since meeting with him on Monday, an athletic department
official said Thursday that school lawyers were still hopeful that
a deal could be worked out.
While Jarvis may be the most qualified candidate, he is not the
only one under consideration. The official said that one of the
three other coaches who were interviewed last week will be brought
in for a second interview.
School officials would not confirm which of the three among
Siena's Paul Hewitt, Davidson's Bob McKillop and St. Bonaventure's
Jim Baron would be invited back, but according to one Division I
coach, it was believed to be Hewitt. Hewitt posted a 17-12 record
in his first season as a head coach after five seasons as an
assistant at Villanova.
Thursday marks four weeks since St. John's informed Fran
Fraschilla of its intention to dismiss him, and the school has yet
to make an offer to anyone. Despite speculation that Jarvis, who
met with Athletic Director Ed Manetta, the executive vice
president, Robert Crimmins, and the university president, the Rev.
Donald Harrington, would be the next coach, Jarvis' lawyer, Robert
Ades, said Thursday that there has been no word.
Jarvis would command more money than any of the other
candidates, but he also has the best credentials, including four
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament appearances in
eight seasons at George Washington, more than the other coaches
combined.
Jarvis earned $600,000 last year and still has four years left
on his contract. His salary demands would be in the range of
$800,000 per year, although Ades insisted that numbers were never
discussed with St. John's.
According to a person familiar with the situation, St. John's
believes it could bring in any of the other three coaches for
between $300,000 and $350,000 per year, less than it was paying
Fraschilla, who earned $450,000.
