Mycoplasma strains were first linked to human infections in the
1930s and 1940s. They are a major cause of atypical pneumonia, and
have been isolated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia,
urinary tract infections and AIDS.
Garth Nicolson is a respected cancer researcher, who until 1996
was the David Bruton Jr. Chair in Cancer Research at the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His wife, Nancy,
was an instructor in biophysics at Baylor College of Medicine.
Their journey began in 1991, when Garth Nicolson's daughter,
Sharron, returned from the Persian Gulf with health problems. She
had been a staff sergeant and crew chief of a Blackhawk helicopter
with the Army's 101st Airborne Division, and was completing pilot
training when she became ill.
Her symptoms were typical of Gulf War illness. Among them:
fatigue, intermittent fever, joint and muscle pain and impairments
in short-term memory.
Nancy Nicolson found those symptoms familiar. She had suffered a
similar illness in 1987 while working at Baylor, she said. At that
time, she and her husband experimented with antibiotic treatment
that eventually cured her illness.
Some pro-choice groups want to make Rep. Kay Granger of Texas
face the music, claiming she ain't dancing with them what brung her
to the big party in Washington.
Supporters for her challenger in November, Democrat Tom Hall,
are trying to use the Republican congresswoman's voting record to
paint her as anti-choice.
Her detractors, including Hall, the Fort Worth attorney who
faces her in the general election, point to that record as evidence
of her kowtowing to Republican bigwigs inside the Texas delegation
and out, rather than doing right by her moderately conservative
district.
Without question, the former Fort Worth mayor has learned some
fancy footwork that usually takes new members of Congress longer to
master. She sashayed up to House Speaker Newt Gingrich quicker than
you can say Cotton-Eyed Joe, and it paid off in powerful
appointments and opportunities normally not bestowed on lowly
freshmen. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee was
a coup for a rookie, as was her appointment to the House Budget
Committee, where she fought hard to limit defense spending cuts.
Her voting record can't be argued. According to Congressional
Quarterly, Granger voted 95 percent of the time with her GOP
colleagues on party-line issues. That should put to rest the
concerns by GOP leaders prior to her 1996 election that she might
not be loyal to the Republicans.
